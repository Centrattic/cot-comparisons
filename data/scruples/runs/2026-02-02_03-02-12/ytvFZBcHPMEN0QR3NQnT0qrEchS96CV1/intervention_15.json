He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a romantic relationship that turned out to be based on the partner being transgender. The author felt they were lied to because their partner didn't disclose being trans earlier. Now they're not attracted anymore and want to stay friends but not pursue a relationship. The partner is upset and called the author names like evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points here are honesty in relationships, autonomy, and mutual respect. The author's partner didn't disclose their trans identity, which the author considers important. The author felt it was a lie, which is a big deal because trust is foundational in relationships. \n\nBut wait, maybe the partner didn't feel ready to share that information. Trans individuals often face discrimination and fear rejection, so they might have wanted to build trust first. However, when it comes to romantic or sexual relationships, certain details like gender identity are relevant because they affect attraction. So, if the author is strictly straight and wasn't attracted to a vagina, the partner's trans status is a significant detail that should have been known earlier. \n\nThe author is facing a dilemma here. They liked the person but lost attraction upon learning they are trans. It's natural for attraction to be based on gender identity. The author isn't being offensive; they're stating their preferences. They also want to maintain a friendship, which shows they care about the person as a friend. \n\nThe partner's reaction is intense, calling the author names. That's not healthy. If the partner accused the author of faking the friendship, that's a projection and manipulative behavior. The author is honest about their feelings and isn't trying to harm the partner. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is not in the wrong. They acted based on their own feelings and preferences. They didn't misrepresent themselves. The partner, on the other hand, withheld information that the author found crucial. The author is allowed to change their feelings upon new information. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
