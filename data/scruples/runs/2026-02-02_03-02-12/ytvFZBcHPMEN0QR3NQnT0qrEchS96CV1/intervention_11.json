He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is transgender and no longer being attracted to them, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone they found attractive and developed a relationship. They started dating, shared physical intimacy, and then during a sexual encounter, discovered the person is trans. The person didn't disclose this before, and the author now feels lied to. The author identifies as strictly straight and isn't attracted to vaginas. They feel the person should have told them earlier, which would have allowed the author to adjust their feelings. Now the author wants to end the relationship, and the other person is upset, calling them names.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take. I need to evaluate if the author is at fault here. \n\nFrom a general perspective, authenticity and honesty in relationships are important. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until a sexual encounter happened. The author felt misled because they wanted to know that detail to make an informed choice. However, the trans person might have struggled with when or how to disclose their identity, especially if they feared rejection. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they value honesty and that the trans person waited until a critical moment to reveal something important. The author's attraction is based on a penis, which they can't change, so they feel they can't continue the relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't judging the trans person's identity but is making a choice based on their own preferences. Ending a relationship when you discover something that affects your attraction isn't inherently wrong. However, the author might not have considered the other person's feelings in disclosing their identity. But in terms of right or wrong, the author's choice to end things isn't necessarily malicious. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not accepted, but the author isn't obligated to change their preferences. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author is being honest with their feelings and making a personal choice based on their attraction, which isn't something they can control. The trans person's actions might have been inconsiderate by not disclosing earlier, but the author isn't at fault for ending the relationship upon discovering this.\n"
