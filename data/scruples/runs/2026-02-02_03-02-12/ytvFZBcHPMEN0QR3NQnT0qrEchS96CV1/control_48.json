He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a trans man who didn't disclose his gender identity until a sexual encounter was about to happen. The author feels lied to and is no longer attracted to him because they're strictly straight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the trans man's perspective. Transitioning and being open about one's gender identity is a personal journey. He might have been waiting for the right time to come out, perhaps due to fear of rejection or not feeling ready. However, in a romantic context, certain information is important for both parties to know. If he didn't disclose this earlier, it could be seen as not being fully honest, especially since they were friends for months and the relationship was becoming serious.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable if they're not attracted to vaginas. They aren't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone once they find out. However, the key point is whether the trans man intentionally withheld information. If he was open about his identity earlier, maybe the author's reaction would be different. But since the author felt lied to, that's a problem.\n\nThe trans man's anger and accusations might be due to feeling rejected or hurt, but calling the author manipulative is not justified. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because of this. The main issue here is communication. The trans man could have been more upfront earlier, but the author isn't responsible for their own feelings or the trans man's emotional response.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. The trans man's actions (withholding info) contributed to the situation, but the author's decision to end the relationship is valid. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
