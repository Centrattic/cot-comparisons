He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for losing attraction after finding out their crush is trans. The key points are: the person discovered their partner is trans during intimacy, feels lied to because the partner didn't disclose earlier, and now the partner is upset and angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The partner didn't disclose their trans status. But was there an obligation to do so? In many cases, people might choose when to share personal information, and it's not always necessary to reveal everything upfront unless it's a dealbreaker known from the start. However, if a person's gender identity is a significant factor in how someone views them, the timing of disclosure can matter. \n\nThe author mentions that the partner had months to tell them. If the author's attraction is solely based on the partner having a penis, then finding out later might affect their feelings. But is it the author's fault for having those preferences? People have different attractions, and it's not inherently wrong to prefer certain traits. However, the way the author reacted might come into play. They stopped the interaction immediately upon realizing the partner isn't cisgender, which could be seen as a quick loss of interest based on a physical trait, which some might argue is superficial. \n\nBut the partner is trans, which is a part of their identity. The partner might have felt vulnerable or unready to disclose. The author's reaction could be hurtful, but if the author isn't attracted to trans men, it's a personal choice. The partner's anger might stem from feeling rejected or judged. However, the partner's initial decision to not disclose could also be an issue, depending on cultural or personal norms around honesty in relationships.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, there's no law requiring someone to disclose their trans status. The question is more about social morality. The author isn't in the wrong for having preferences they can't control. They might be in the wrong if they judged the trans person negatively, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. The author wants to remain friends, which shows a willingness to maintain the relationship in some form. The partner's reaction seems extreme, calling the author names, which might be their way of handling rejection rather than the author's fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for not continuing the relationship due to personal attraction preferences. They are not obligated to be in a relationship they don't want. The trans partner's anger may be more about dealing with rejection than the author's actions being wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
