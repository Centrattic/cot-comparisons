He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author developing feelings for someone they later discover is transgender. The key points here are the author's reaction upon finding out, the trans person's disclosure timing, and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they were in a romantic relationship with this person, which escalated to the point of almost having sex. The author found out the person is trans during a sexual encounter when they noticed the absence of a penis. The author feels lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. They admit they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction diminished after the discovery. They want to stay friends but the relationship has broken down, and the person is upset, even calling the author names like \"evil and manipulative.\"\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The trans person might have had valid reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe related to their own comfort with their identity or fear of rejection. However, in a romantic relationship, especially when considering sexual intimacy, certain aspects of one's identity are usually considered important to disclose. The author felt betrayed because the person didn't share this significant detail before the relationship became intimate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being accused of being in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. But attraction is subjective and personal. The author is clear about being straight, so their lack of attraction to a vagina is a personal preference. They aren't making a judgment about the person's identity but are stating their own feelings. The author also tried to maintain a friendship, which shows they didn't want to hurt the other person unnecessarily.\n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected or invalidated. However, the author isn't at fault for their own feelings. The trans person could have disclosed their identity earlier if it was important. The situation is complex because it involves both parties' boundaries and communication. The author acted based on their own preferences and tried to be honest once they realized the issue. They didn't push for the relationship to continue if it wasn't right for them.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't wrong for not being attracted to someone who is trans if that's not part of their orientation. They also aren't wrong for ending the romantic relationship. The main issue is the trans person's decision not to disclose sooner. However, the author's responsibility might be in how they communicated their feelings after the fact. But given the circumstances\u2014discovering this during a sexual encounter and then trying to maintain the friendship\u2014it seems the author acted as someone would in a similar situation. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
