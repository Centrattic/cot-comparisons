He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's crush is trans, and upon discovering this during a moment of intimacy, they suddenly weren't attracted anymore and want to stay friends. The crush is upset and accused them of being evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author met someone at art school, they became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and things escalated to a point where they almost had sex. The author then found out the person is trans during a physical encounter. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. They feel the trans person didn't disclose this earlier, so the author stopped the relationship. The trans person is now angry and even accused the author of faking the friendship, leading the author to question if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after finding out their partner is trans. Let's break it down. The author is straight, so their lack of attraction is based on their sexual orientation. The trans person didn't disclose their status before intimacy. The author felt lied to because they had months to talk but didn't mention it until that moment. The trans person is now upset, but the author is trying to maintain the friendship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, people are generally expected to be honest about their gender identity, especially if it's a factor in the relationship. However, the trans person might have felt the need to build trust before sharing such personal information. The author's reaction is based on their own preferences, which are valid as long as they're not harmful. The problem arises when the author ends the relationship suddenly, possibly hurting the other person's feelings. But since the author is honest about being straight and not attracted to vaginas, it's a matter of personal preference rather than a discriminatory attitude. The trans person's anger could stem from feeling rejected after building a connection, which is understandable, but the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to them. The author isn't being offensive but is clear about their boundaries. The accusations of being evil or manipulative seem exaggerated, so the author isn't the one with sociopathic traits. The author is trying to be friends again, which is considerate. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
