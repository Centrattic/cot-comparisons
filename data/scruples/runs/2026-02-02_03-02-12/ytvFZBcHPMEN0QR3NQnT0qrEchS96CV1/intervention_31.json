He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they discovered their crush is transgender and are no longer attracted to them, leading to a breakup and some conflict. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone, developed a friendship, then a romantic relationship. They didn't know the person was trans until a moment before they were about to have sex. The author feels that the person didn't disclose their trans status in a timely manner, which the author considers important. Now, the author is not attracted anymore and wants to stay friends, but the other person is upset, calling them names.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom what I know, transgender individuals have the right to their identity and should not be discriminated against. However, the author is stating that they are straight and not attracted to vaginas. So their lack of attraction isn't necessarily a negative judgment but a personal preference. The author isn't attacking the person for being trans, just stating that their attraction isn't there anymore upon knowing. \n\nThe other person might feel that the author was deceptive or didn't respect their identity, but the author didn't know. The author also mentions wanting to maintain the friendship, which shows they aren't being malicious. The trans person not disclosing earlier could be a point of contention, but it's possible they didn't feel safe to share that information earlier. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being straight and not being able to get past the trans status in this context. The problem here is more about the trans person's right to self-identify and disclose at their own pace, while the author's right to their own preferences. The author isn't being discriminatory by being honest about their attraction. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
