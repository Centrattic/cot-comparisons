He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person met a guy they thought was cisgender, became friends, then started dating. They were about to have sex when they discovered the guy is trans, specifically a trans woman. The author then felt like they were lied to because the guy didn't come out earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas anymore, so their attraction faded. The guy is upset and called them evil, which is confusing the author.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author's main issue is about the timing of the guy revealing his trans identity. They felt it was a lie because he waited until they were about to have sex to tell them, even though he had known them for months. The author isn't attracted to trans women, so the revelation changed their feelings. The guy is now upset and lashing out, which the author sees as possible manipulation.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong, I need to think about whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author is an asshole (AITA). The user is asking if the author is wrong for not continuing the relationship after finding out the guy is trans.\n\nFirst, the author's attraction changed upon discovering the guy is trans. That's a personal preference, and while it might be unfortunate, it's not necessarily wrong unless it's discriminatory. The key here is whether the author's reaction was based on a misunderstanding or if they had prior knowledge. The author mentions that if the guy had told them earlier, maybe they could have adjusted. But since it came up during intimacy, it's a shock.\n\nNext, the guy's responsibility to disclose. Trans people are people too, and they often face societal pressures about when and how to come out. The guy might have felt it was important to build a relationship first before disclosing, or maybe he didn't feel safe enough to do so. However, if the author is strictly straight and needs to know about such things before intimacy, then the guy might have a point in not revealing earlier if he wanted to pursue a romantic relationship without that information affecting the other person's feelings.\n\nBut the author's problem is that they felt lied to because the guy didn't tell them sooner. The author is straight, so they didn't want a relationship with a trans woman. The guy might have known that and didn't want to lose the connection. However, the author didn't know he was trans until that moment, which led to their attraction fading.\n\nIs the author wrong for not continuing the relationship? The author isn't in the wrong for being straight and not attracted to trans women. It's their personal preference. However, the situation is complicated because the guy didn't disclose his identity earlier, which the author found deceptive.\n\nBut wait, the author is asking if they are in the wrong. If the guy didn't come out until that moment, and the author's attraction is based on the person being cisgender, then the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. However, the way the author approached the situation matters. Did they confront the guy with anger or try to understand his perspective? The author seems to feel they were lied to, but the guy might have felt he was being honest in his own timeline.\n\nAlso, the guy's reaction is extreme\u2014he called the author evil and manipulative, which is toxic behavior. The author might be the one in the right here, given that the guy didn't disclose something important, and the author's feelings are valid. But the author's decision to stop the relationship might be seen as a natural response to the loss of attraction, not manipulation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't wrong for being honest about their preferences and ending the relationship. It's important to be authentic in relationships. The guy might have a right to feel hurt, but the author isn't at fault for not being able to overcome their lack of attraction after discovering the trans identity. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
