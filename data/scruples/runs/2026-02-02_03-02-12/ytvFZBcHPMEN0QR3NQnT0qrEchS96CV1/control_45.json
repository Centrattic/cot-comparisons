He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where the author discovers their partner is transgender and then loses attraction, leading to the end of the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone at art school, they became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and had physical intimacy. During a moment of intimacy, the author realizes the partner is trans and stops the encounter. The partner is upset, calling the author names, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after discovering the partner is trans, especially since the author identifies as straight. The author feels they were lied to because the partner didn't disclose being trans earlier. However, the partner might not have felt the need to disclose that information before becoming intimate, especially if they had been dating for months.\n\nI should consider societal perspectives. Some people might argue that the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to be honest about their attractions and preferences. Others might say that the author's reaction is harmful and transphobic, but the author does express understanding of the partner's struggles. Also, the partner's reaction seems extreme, calling the author names, which might indicate their own issues.\n\nThe author did try to maintain a friendship and didn't push further into the relationship once they realized the issue. They also express that they weren't attracted to vaginas and that the partner didn't tell them earlier. However, the timing of the disclosure is a point of contention. The author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their sexual orientation, even if it's uncomfortable for the partner.\n\nOn the other hand, if the partner had transitioned socially and lived as their true self, they might not have felt the need to mention it earlier. The author's attraction being solely based on a penis could be a matter of personal preference, not necessarily wrong, but it's important to consider if the partner felt pressured to keep it secret.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to their attraction preferences. They communicated their feelings and tried to remain respectful. The partner's reaction seems more about their own hurt feelings rather than the author's actions being inherently wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
