He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush being trans and the author losing attraction. The user wants a yes or no answer, A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author met someone at art school, they became friends, developed a romantic relationship. The author found out the person is trans during a moment of intimacy. The author feels lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier. They state they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. Now the friend is upset and accused the author of being evil and manipulative. The author is confused if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author act wrongly by ending the relationship after learning about the trans identity? The author isn't in the wrong if they're not attracted to the person anymore. However, the question is about whether the author is wrong for not continuing the relationship. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014stopping the relationship because of a change in attraction\u2014seems personal and not necessarily unethical. It's about personal preferences. The trans person didn't disclose early, which the author feels was a lie. But the author's response is to end the relationship, which is their right. However, the author might have been abrupt in their reaction. But the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe trans person's anger might be due to feeling rejected, but the author isn't obligated to continue the relationship. The author's honesty about their preferences isn't wrong. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
