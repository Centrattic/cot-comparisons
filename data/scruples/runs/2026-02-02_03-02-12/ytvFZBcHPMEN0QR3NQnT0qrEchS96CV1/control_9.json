He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering their crush is transgender and losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and their partner had been friends for months, developing a romantic relationship. The author found out the partner is trans during a moment of intimacy, which was a shock. The partner didn't disclose this earlier, and the author feels lied to. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. Now the partner is upset and called the author names.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're an asshole for ending the relationship. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the partner's decision not to disclose their trans status earlier is a big factor. If someone is in a romantic relationship and hasn't shared something fundamental like their gender identity, that could be seen as withholding information. However, the author's reaction is based on their attraction, which is a personal preference. It's not the author's fault for being straight. The partner's anger and accusations might be misplaced. \n\nThe author is trying to remain friends but the partner is upset. The author isn't forcing the relationship; they're honest about their feelings. The partner's behavior, like calling the author names and implying faking the friendship, seems more like a reaction to rejection than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They aren't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not attracted. The main issue is the partner not being upfront, but that doesn't make the author an asshole for ending things based on their attraction.\n"
