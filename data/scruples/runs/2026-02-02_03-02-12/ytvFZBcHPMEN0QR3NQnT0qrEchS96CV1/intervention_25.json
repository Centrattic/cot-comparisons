He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is that they discovered their crush is trans and subsequently lost attraction. Let me think through the key points here.\n\nFirst, the author met someone they found attractive and developed a close relationship. The problem arises when they find out the person is trans, which leads to a loss of attraction. The author feels they were lied to because the person didn't disclose that aspect earlier. But was the trans person obligated to reveal their identity from the start? That's a big question. Transgender individuals often decide when and if to share their identity, especially if they're in a relationship with someone who was previously unaware. \n\nThe author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's their personal preference, which is valid. However, the trans person in question had a penis before transitioning, and the author didn't realize the change. So maybe the author was attracted to the trans person when they presented as male, and now feels confused because the anatomy isn't as expected. But trans women are women, and their experiences of attraction can vary. The author's issue is about not being attracted to a vagina, which is a personal choice, but the way they found out might be problematic.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the trans person didn't disclose their identity early enough, leading to a situation where the author feels misled. However, if the trans person wasn't out to the author, they might have a valid reason for not disclosing, such as fear of rejection or safety. The author now wants to continue the friendship but the trans person is upset and angry, which complicates things further.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is facing their own feelings and preferences, which are legitimate. They didn't know the person was trans, so they didn't make a decision based on that information. The trans person might feel like the author is rejecting them for their identity, but the author is clear that their preference is for a penis. However, the way the author approached the situation\u2014stopping the relationship immediately after the disclosure\u2014might be hurtful, but not necessarily wrong if it's their genuine feeling. \n\nThe key here is consent and disclosure. The trans person might have been upfront eventually, even if it was later. The author's reaction is based on personal preferences, which are valid. The author isn't being malicious; they're honest about their attraction. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not being accepted, which is a common issue in trans relationships. However, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone, especially if that person didn't disclose their identity earlier. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They are being honest about their preferences. The trans person might have the right to feel hurt, but the author's actions don't make them an asshole. The answer should be B.\n"
