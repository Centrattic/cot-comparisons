He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who found out their crush is trans and then lost attraction, leading to a breakup. The author feels they weren't lied to but are confused about why the person didn't disclose earlier. The main question is if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The trans person didn't disclose their identity early on. The author feels it was important information that wasn't shared until a sexual context. But trans people often have reasons for being cautious about sharing such personal information, especially in a new relationship. They might fear rejection or discrimination. So, the trans person might not have felt safe to disclose earlier.\n\nThe author's reaction is about attraction being tied to physical characteristics. They mention being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's a personal preference, and while some might judge that, it's not inherently wrong. The key issue is whether the trans person withheld information that the author considered crucial. However, the trans person might have felt the timing wasn't appropriate until they felt more comfortable.\n\nThe author didn't force anything and stopped when they realized. They also want to remain friends. The trans person's anger and accusations might stem from hurt feelings rather than the author's direct wrongdoing. The author isn't in the wrong for having personal boundaries about attraction. However, maybe they could have communicated better about their preferences earlier, but the trans person also didn't disclose. Both sides have some responsibility here, but the author's actions don't seem malicious. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
