He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a crush on someone who is trans, and after getting into a close relationship, found out the person is trans. The author then stopped being interested, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the timeline. The author mentions they became friends over months, then started dating. The key point here is when the trans person disclosed their identity. The author is upset because the person didn't tell them earlier, which the author feels was a lie. The author is straight, so that's a valid orientation, and they're not attracted to vaginas. The problem is that the trans person didn't disclose early on, leading to a situation where the author felt misled. \n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, honesty in relationships is usually important. If someone is dating another person and has a significant aspect of their identity that's relevant (like being trans, especially if the partner's orientation is strict), then not disclosing that until things get intimate could be seen as a failure to be upfront. The author could argue that they were not given the chance to decide if they wanted to continue the relationship based on that information, leading to the current situation where their feelings have faded after the disclosure.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have had their reasons for not disclosing earlier, maybe due to fear of rejection or not wanting to ruin the friendship. However, the author feels that the information was withheld for too long, especially since it's a key factor in their attraction. The author's decision to end the romantic aspect but stay friends seems reasonable, given their orientation. The trans person's anger and accusations seem harsh in this context, but that's their reaction, not the author's fault.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't being dishonest or manipulative. They have a valid orientation and made a decision based on discovering something that affects their attraction. The trans person didn't disclose early enough, which led to the situation. So the author isn't at fault here. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
