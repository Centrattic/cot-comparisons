He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a trans guy who didn't disclose his gender identity until the moment they were about to have sex. The author feels lied to and now isn't attracted to him anymore, leading to a breakup. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The trans person didn't disclose his trans status until a critical moment. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas. They felt it was a lie because it wasn't mentioned earlier, and now the relationship can't continue. The other person is upset and called the author names, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, being attracted to someone and then not being attracted after learning something about them isn't inherently wrong. The question is whether the trans person was obligated to disclose earlier. In many cases, people don't disclose their gender identity unless it's relevant. However, in a romantic context, some might argue that honesty from the start is important. But the key here is that the author is straight and the trans person is a trans man. If he's on hormone therapy or has a chest, maybe the author didn't perceive his gender identity as immediately obvious. \n\nThe trans person's disclosure at that moment might have been when he felt comfortable or when he thought it was necessary. But the author felt it was a lie because it wasn't mentioned earlier. The author isn't responsible for the trans person's decision to disclose when he did. The author's reaction is about their own feelings of attraction, which is valid. Ending a relationship because of that isn't wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
