He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a romantic relationship with someone who is trans, and during a sexual encounter, they discovered the person didn't have a penis. The author then lost attraction and wants to stay friends, but the trans person is upset and called them names. The author is questioning if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The trans individual didn't disclose their identity until the moment of intimacy. The author states they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. The question is about whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after this revelation.\n\nI think about consent and honesty in relationships. It's important for both parties to be honest about their identities and boundaries. The trans person might have felt it was the right time to come out when they did, but if the author had a specific sexual preference that they were clear about, the trans person should have known that upfront. However, the author didn't mention their preference before the intimate moment either. \n\nThe author's reaction is based on their personal attraction, which is valid. Being attracted to a specific anatomy is a personal choice, and they're not obligated to change that. The trans person's anger could stem from feeling that the author only valued them for their gender presentation, not as a person. But the author is trying to be respectful, acknowledging the other's courage and the difficulty of being trans.\n\nI also consider societal perspectives. Some might argue that the author is being disrespectful by not accepting the trans person's identity, but the author isn't rejecting them; they're stating their lack of attraction. On the other hand, others might think the trans person should have come out earlier. But the author might not have been aware of the trans person's status before the intimate moment, so the trans person's timing could be an issue here.\n\nThe author's intention was to maintain a friendship. They didn't act maliciously but were honest when they realized the situation. The trans person's accusation of being evil and manipulative seems harsh, possibly projecting their own feelings of rejection. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the romantic part due to personal preferences. They're not denying the trans person's identity but stating their own feelings.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted anymore after discovering the trans status, especially since they tried to be understanding and want to stay friends.\n"
