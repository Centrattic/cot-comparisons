He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent, disclosure, and personal boundaries. The trans individual didn't disclose their identity earlier, and the author discovered it during an intimate moment. The author feels lied to because they believe this information was important and should have been shared beforehand. \n\nI need to consider the trans person's perspective. Transitioning can be a deeply personal journey, and some people prefer to disclose their trans status early, while others might wait until they feel comfortable. However, withholding information that affects the relationship's foundation can be problematic, especially when it pertains to something as significant as gender identity.\n\nThe author isn't being judgmental about being trans; they're clear they're straight and aren't interested in a vagina. Their issue is with the disclosure timing. The trans person might feel hurt because the relationship ended after the truth came out, but the author's reaction seems reasonable given their lack of attraction. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations of being evil or manipulative might indicate they feel betrayed, but the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their feelings. People have the right to their preferences, and it's not the author's fault they're not attracted to someone with a vagina. \n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. Since the author acted based on their own feelings and preferences, and the trans person didn't disclose the information earlier, the author isn't at fault. The responsibility for disclosure rests with the trans individual, as it's a fundamental aspect of their identity. The author isn't the one being inconsiderate here; they're acting on their truth. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
