He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a person who started dating someone they met at art school, who they later found out is trans. The key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after discovering this.\n\nFirst, the user says they found out on the verge of having sex that their crush is trans. The person had not disclosed this information up front. The author feels lied to because the trans person waited until a sexual situation to reveal this. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. They want to stay friends but not pursue a romantic relationship anymore. However, the other person is upset and called the author names like evil and manipulative.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The trans person didn't disclose their identity before the relationship became sexual. The author had a right to know, especially since sexual orientation and gender identity are significant factors in romantic relationships. The author is being honest about their preferences and isn't trying to be offensive. They\u2019re not rejecting the person for who they are but for their physical attributes, which is a matter of personal preference.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might have felt vulnerable and chosen to reveal their identity when they felt the relationship was more stable. However, withholding such a key detail until a sexual encounter could be seen as misleading. The author's reaction is based on their own orientation, which is valid. They\u2019re not in the wrong for being honest about not being attracted to someone in a way they can't change.\n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected or invalidated, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not wanting to continue a relationship that's not aligned with their preferences. So, the author isn't the asshole here. They made a difficult decision based on their values and feelings, and they're trying to maintain friendship despite the change in their relationship status.\n"
