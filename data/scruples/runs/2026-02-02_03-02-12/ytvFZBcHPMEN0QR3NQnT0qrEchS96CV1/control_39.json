He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a romantic relationship with their crush, who later revealed they're trans. The author then lost attraction and wanted to stay friends, but the crush became angry, calling them evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions that their attraction diminished after discovering their crush is trans, and they're not attracted to vaginas. The crush didn't disclose this information earlier, and the author feels like they were lied to. The author wants to remain friends but the crush is upset and making accusations.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their attraction. Let's break it down. Attraction is subjective. If the author is strictly straight and isn't into vaginas, then it's understandable that their attraction would fade after discovering the truth. The crush didn't come out as trans earlier, which might be a point of contention. But the author didn't ask about their gender identity, and the crush might not have felt comfortable sharing that information upfront. \n\nThe author is being honest about their feelings. They liked the person as a friend and had a connection, but the lack of attraction after the revelation is a personal choice. The crush is upset because they expected a different response, but the author isn't at fault for their own lack of attraction. The accusations of being manipulative or evil seem like an overreaction from the crush's side. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't being deceptive. They're acknowledging their feelings and choosing to end the romantic aspect while maintaining friendship. The crush's reaction seems more about feeling rejected than the author being wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for not being into someone else, especially when they were honest about their orientation from the start. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting on their own feelings and preferences, which are valid. The crush's anger stems from their own expectations, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
