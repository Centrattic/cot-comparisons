He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a trans man who didn't disclose his gender identity until a sexual encounter, leading the author to feel lied to and lose attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions they were friends for months and developed a romantic relationship. The trans man didn't disclose his being trans until during a sexual act. The author feels that the timing of the disclosure was inappropriate and that it affected their ability to be attracted. They want to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship anymore, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The trans man's disclosure timing. 2) The author's reaction and feelings of betrayal. 3) The trans man's anger and accusations towards the author.\n\nIn terms of ethics and relationships, honesty and communication are crucial. The trans man had the right to be his authentic self, but the timing of the disclosure might have been problematic. However, the author's attraction is a personal matter. People can have different boundaries about what they consider important to know before engaging in a relationship. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling that information was withheld too late, especially if it's a deal-breaker for them.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans man might have felt comfortable enough to share his identity when he was ready. It's possible he didn't want to disclose earlier due to fear of rejection or other personal reasons. The author's reaction could be seen as valid because attraction is subjective, and they might not be able to reconcile their feelings post-disclosure.\n\nThe trans man's response of anger and calling the author names seems more concerning. Labeling someone as manipulative without evidence isn't healthy. However, the author's decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily malicious. They're stating their feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for losing attraction after discovering something they consider vital. The trans man had the right to his identity, but the author is also entitled to their feelings. The conflict arises from differing expectations and communication breakdowns. The author isn't at fault for making a decision based on their comfort and desires.\n"
