He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The person in question is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. The key points here are that they were in a relationship that was progressing towards intimacy, and during a moment of physical intimacy, they discovered that their partner is trans. The user then lost interest and ended the romantic part of the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The user is questioning whether it's wrong to no longer be attracted to someone after learning they're trans. The user identifies as strictly straight and isn't attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose this information earlier, which the user feels was a form of deception.\n\nI should think about the trans person's perspective. Many trans individuals choose when and how to disclose their identity. There's no legal or moral obligation to share this information upfront, especially in the early stages of a relationship. However, the user feels misled because the disclosure came during a moment of physical intimacy, which might be seen as a critical time for such information.\n\nNext, the user's reaction: they stopped the relationship, which the trans person took badly, even calling them names. The user is now worried about being labeled as evil or manipulative. The core issue here is whether the user is in the wrong for ending the relationship after discovering the trans identity.\n\nI need to evaluate if the user acted in bad faith. They didn't know the person was trans and had developed feelings over time. Upon discovering this, they felt they couldn't continue the relationship. The user isn't making a judgment about the person's identity but about their own attraction. It's important to note that attraction is subjective and varies per individual. The user isn't rejecting the person as a human but as a romantic partner due to their own orientation.\n\nThe trans person's upset reaction might stem from feeling rejected or misunderstood. However, the user's actions were based on their own feelings of attraction, which they can't control. The user also wants to maintain a friendship, showing they care about the relationship beyond just the romantic aspect.\n\nLegal and social considerations: there's no law requiring someone to disclose their trans status. Socially, while some may argue that the trans person should have been honest earlier, others might say the user has the right to their feelings. The situation is complex because attraction is personal, and the disclosure timing is a point of contention.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to their own lack of attraction. They acted based on their feelings and boundaries. The trans person's anger might stem from the way the disclosure was handled, but the user's response is about their own orientation. Therefore, the answer is B (the user is not in the wrong).\n"
