He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their crush is transgender and then lost attraction, leading to a breakup. The person is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer developed a relationship with someone they thought was male, and later found out the person is trans. The writer is straight, so they're not attracted to vaginas. The trans person didn't disclose this earlier, which led to the writer feeling lied to. Now, the trans person is upset and accused the writer of being evil.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The writer's argument is that the trans person didn't mention their identity in time, and since the writer is straight, they can't be attracted to a vagina. The writer wants to stay friends but not date anymore, but the trans person is angry.\n\nHmm. Let's break down the responsibilities here. In any relationship, especially as it becomes more intimate, honesty is crucial. The trans person may have felt it was important to disclose their identity at some point, but they might have been waiting for the right time or felt it wasn't necessary until a certain point. However, once the relationship became physical, it's possible that the writer's expectations (being straight) weren't met, leading to the loss of attraction.\n\nBut the writer's issue is about not being told earlier. If the trans person didn't mention their identity until it was too late, maybe there's a lack of transparency. But at the same time, the writer is being honest about their own preferences. It's a bit of a tricky situation because both parties might have had different expectations.\n\nThe writer isn't trying to hurt the trans person; they're just being honest about their feelings. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not accepted, which is a valid feeling, but it's also about whether the writer had the right to feel that way. The writer isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who they later found out is trans, especially if they identify as straight. Their reaction seems honest.\n\nOn the other hand, if the trans person had disclosed earlier, maybe the writer could have processed it. But the writer isn't being malicious here. They're just being truthful about their feelings once they found out. So I think the answer is B, the writer isn't in the wrong.\n"
