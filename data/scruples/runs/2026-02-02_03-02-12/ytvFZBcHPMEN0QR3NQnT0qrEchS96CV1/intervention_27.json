He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is transgender and losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship. The author is questioning if they're being unfair or offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they had been friends for months, developed a romantic relationship, and during a sexual encounter discovered their crush is trans. The author feels lied to because the information wasn't disclosed earlier. They clarify they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they ended the relationship. The other person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity upfront. In many cases, people don't disclose such personal information until they feel comfortable or it becomes relevant. However, gender identity is a significant aspect of one's identity, and some might argue that it should be discussed before engaging in a romantic or sexual relationship, especially if physical attraction is a key component.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They state they're strictly straight and can't overcome their attraction to a penis. That's a valid personal preference, even if it's not politically correct. The question is whether it's the author's fault for having those preferences or if the trans person should have been more upfront.\n\nLegally and ethically, transgender people are protected from discrimination, but personal attraction is subjective. The author isn't necessarily at fault for their feelings, but they might be in the wrong if they expected the trans person to hide their identity to maintain a relationship. However, the trans person could be at fault for not being honest about their identity before becoming intimate.\n\nAnother angle: the trans person might be non-binary or identify differently, but the story refers to them as a \"he,\" which could be a misgendering. If the person transitioned socially, the author might not have known, and the trans person might not have felt safe to disclose earlier. The author might not have had all the information to make an informed choice about the relationship.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling lied to. If the trans person didn't hide their identity but it wasn't discussed, it's a situation where both parties might have made assumptions. But since the author didn't know and the trans person didn't disclose, it's a mutual lack of information. The author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation, which is a personal choice. Ending the relationship because of that isn't necessarily wrong, but the trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not accepted.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that the author is being unfair by ending the relationship upon discovering the trans identity, while others might say the author isn't obligated to change their preferences. The key here is whether the trans person withheld information that was necessary for the author to make a decision. If the trans person didn't know if the author was trans-friendly, they might have hesitated to disclose. However, in a romantic context, such information is typically shared when appropriate.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings or ending the relationship. They are honest about their preferences and made a decision based on personal attraction. The trans person might have a right to feel upset, but the author isn't at fault for not wanting to pursue a relationship with someone whose gender identity doesn't match their own.\n"
