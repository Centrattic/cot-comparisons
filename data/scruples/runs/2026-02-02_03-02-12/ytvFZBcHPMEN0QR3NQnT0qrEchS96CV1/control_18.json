He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their crush is trans and is no longer attracted to them, leading to the relationship ending and some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, and then the relationship became romantic. The author didn't know the person was trans. They discovered it during a moment when they were about to have sex. The author then feels they were lied to, as the person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. The author identifies as straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. The person they're asking about is now upset and has accused the author of being manipulative. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nTransgender issues are sensitive. The person's identity is a core part of who they are. However, when it comes to disclosure, the timing is important. The author is arguing that the trans person didn't disclose their identity, which is a significant factor for the author's attraction. But, from a trans perspective, they might not have felt comfortable revealing that early on, especially if they were still in the process of transitioning or if they were in a different social context. Some people might not disclose their trans status until they feel more comfortable or it's relevant to the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they are straight and not attracted to vaginas. That's a personal preference, and it's valid for them to realize they're not interested in continuing the relationship once they know. However, the way they handled it might matter. The author didn't seem to be malicious, just realizing a mismatch in attraction. They also wanted to maintain the friendship.\n\nThe person they were dating reacted angrily, calling them names. This could indicate that the person was hiding their identity for a reason, perhaps due to fear of rejection. If the trans person felt they couldn't come out earlier, that's a different issue. But if the author is now being blamed for being \"evil,\" that's problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to date someone they're not attracted to. However, the trans person's lack of disclosure could be a point of contention. But the author didn't know and can't be blamed for that. The author's response to end the relationship is about their own feelings, which is within their rights. The anger from the other person might stem from their own insecurities or fear of rejection, not the author's actions.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on attraction. They can't be expected to accept a romantic relationship if they don't have the attraction. However, they might need to consider the trans person's perspective on why they didn't disclose earlier. But the author's actions here are about their own feelings, which are legitimate. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
