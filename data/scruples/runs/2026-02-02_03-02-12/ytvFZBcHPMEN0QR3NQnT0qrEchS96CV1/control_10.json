He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a trans person and a straight person who later realized they're not attracted anymore after finding out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author met someone they thought was a guy, developed a friendship, then a romantic relationship. They started getting physically intimate, and during a moment of intimacy, the author found out the person was trans. The author then stopped the interaction, felt like they were lied to, and the trans person is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship after discovering the trans identity. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction was based on the assumption of the person being male. Now that they know, their attraction diminishes. The other person is upset and feels betrayed.\n\nWait, but the trans person didn't come out earlier. The author mentions that they had been friends for months and the trans person didn't disclose their identity. So, maybe the trans person didn't come out, which is a key point here. But trans people often decide when and how to share that part of their identity. It's not always their responsibility to disclose it upfront if they feel safe.\n\nHowever, in a romantic context, especially when things are getting physical, the expectation of honesty might come into play. The author is upset because the trans person didn't tell them earlier. But the trans person might have had reasons for not disclosing, maybe fear of rejection or not feeling comfortable yet.\n\nThe author is now saying they're not attracted anymore because they're straight. The problem here is that the author's attraction was based on the person's physical attributes (penis), which the trans person doesn't have. So, the author's preference is valid, but the trans person might feel that the author is treating them as if they lied.\n\nBut in this case, the trans person didn't lie about their identity. They might have presented as male, but that's part of their self-identity. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they were attracted to someone who they thought was male, and upon knowing the truth, their attraction changed. However, the way the author stopped the interaction could be seen as abrupt, but their reasoning is based on their personal preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might feel hurt because they were open about their trans status after the author discovered it. The author is now choosing not to pursue a relationship, which is their right, but the trans person is reacting negatively, which is also a valid emotional response.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The author isn't forcing the relationship; they're stating their preferences. The trans person might have waited too long to disclose their status, leading the author to make a decision based on new information. The author isn't lying; they're being honest about their feelings. So, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
