He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a person who started dating someone they met at art school, and later found out their crush is trans when they were about to have sex. The author feels they were lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans status earlier. They mention they're strictly straight and now don't feel attracted anymore. The crush is upset and accused them of being evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author didn't know their partner was trans until the moment they were about to have sex. The partner had months to disclose this information but didn't. The author's feelings of being lied to are valid because the partner didn't communicate something the author considers important. The author is not in the relationship anymore and wants to remain friends. The partner is upset and making accusations.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and honesty in relationships. It's crucial for both parties to feel safe and informed. If someone's gender identity is something that affects another's attraction, it's reasonable for the person to expect that information to be shared before becoming intimate. However, the trans person might have feared rejection or not felt comfortable sharing it earlier, which is also a valid concern. But withholding such a significant detail can lead to feelings of betrayal.\n\nThe author's reaction is about personal preference regarding attraction. It's their right to know their own feelings, and they're not wrong for feeling that way. They didn't force the relationship; they stopped when they realized. The partner's accusations of being evil and manipulative are problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on their feelings of attraction and the lack of prior disclosure. The decision to end the relationship isn't malicious but based on their personal preferences and the partner's failure to communicate. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
