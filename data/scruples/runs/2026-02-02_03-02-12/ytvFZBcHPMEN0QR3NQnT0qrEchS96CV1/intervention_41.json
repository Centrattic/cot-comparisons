He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who found out their crush is trans and then lost attraction, leading to a breakup and some hurt feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they didn't know their partner was trans until the moment when they were about to have sex. They felt lied to because the partner didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the revelation changed their feelings. They wanted to continue as friends but the partner is upset and called them names.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and disclosure. The trans person might have been waiting for the right time to come out, maybe feeling comfortable enough. But if the author needed that information to make a decision about their attraction, then the timing of the disclosure matters. However, it's also important to recognize that people have the right to their identity and may not want to disclose it unless they feel secure.\n\nThe author's reaction: they felt lied to, which is a common feeling in such situations. They might not be in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. But maybe they could have handled it more sensitively. The partner called them names, which is toxic. The author isn't evil for not being attracted to someone, but the way they handled the situation could be improved.\n\nAlso, the author wants to be friends, which shows they care about the relationship beyond romance. The partner's anger complicates things. The question is whether the author is at fault for ending the relationship after discovering something that affects their attraction. In many cases, people's attractions are valid, and they aren't obligated to continue a relationship if they're not physically attracted. However, the partner's feelings and the situation where the information was revealed (during a sexual encounter) might add layers. But the author isn't wrong for having those feelings. They are not in the wrong for ending the relationship; they are in the wrong if they handled it poorly or were insensitive, but the core issue is about attraction, which is a personal matter. So the answer is B.\n"
