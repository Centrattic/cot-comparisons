He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a romantic relationship with their crush, who is trans, and after finding out they don't have a penis, the author is no longer attracted to them and wants to remain friends. The crush is now angry and calling the author evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is straight and wasn't attracted to their crush once they realized they're trans. They question if the crush lied by not disclosing this earlier. The author stopped the intimate encounter and tried to continue the friendship, but the crush is upset.\n\nSo, the main issue is about attraction and the trans person not disclosing their status early enough. The author feels they were lied to, but is that accurate? In many cases, people don't always label their gender identity early on in a relationship, especially if it's not immediately relevant. However, if the trans person was in the process of transitioning and the author's attraction is specifically to a penis, then the author's reaction is based on a real difference in their preferences.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for ending the relationship? Well, the author was honest about their attraction being to a penis. If the trans person's body doesn't have one, the author's lack of attraction isn't necessarily their fault. However, the way they found out during an intimate moment might be a problem. The author might have been expected to communicate their needs earlier, but the post says the crush didn't disclose, which could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the crush's reaction seems extreme. Calling someone evil and manipulative, and then accusing them of faking the friendship is not healthy. The author is trying to maintain the friendship, so maybe the crush is overreacting. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is an asshole for not continuing the relationship. The author's reasoning is that their attraction is to a penis, and since the crush is trans, they can't be attracted to them. If the author made their attraction clear before the trans person disclosed, maybe the trans person should have been honest sooner. \n\nHowever, the author might also be making assumptions about the trans person's genitalia based on their presentation. If the trans person hasn't had surgery, maybe they don't look like a cisgender man, but if they presented as male and the author was attracted to that, the author might be in a situation where they didn't realize the trans person's status. \n\nBut in this case, the author found out during a sexual encounter. The trans person might have hidden their status, but the author's response is to not continue the relationship. The author is being honest about their lack of attraction, which is a personal preference. The crush is upset, but the author isn't being offensive, just stating their feelings. \n\nThe author is also trying to preserve the friendship. So, the key points are: the author's straight identity, the trans person's undisclosed status, the author's reaction based on attraction, and the crush's anger. \n\nIn terms of dating ethics, if the trans person didn't disclose their identity early enough, the author isn't wrong for feeling misled. However, the trans person might have a valid reason for not disclosing early on, maybe they were still coming out or unsure themselves. \n\nBut the author is now in a position where their attraction is gone, which is a personal choice. The author isn't being cruel, just honest. The crush's reaction is more about how the author is treating them, but the author is trying to stay friends. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their own attractions and made a decision based on their feelings. The trans person might be wrong for not being open about their identity sooner, but the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n"
