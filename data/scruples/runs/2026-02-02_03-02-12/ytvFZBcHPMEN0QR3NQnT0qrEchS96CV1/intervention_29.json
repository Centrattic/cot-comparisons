He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a trans person not disclosing their trans status before the author found out during a moment of intimacy. The author feels lied to and is no longer attracted, leading to a breakup and conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity upfront, which the author found out during a sexual encounter. The author is straight and isn't attracted to vaginas, so this changed things. The trans person is upset and called the author names, which complicates things.\n\nI remember that in many cultures, people have different expectations about disclosure of gender identity. Some argue that it's important to disclose early, while others might say it's when it feels right. However, the author feels it was a lie and a betrayal because it was withheld during a relationship-building phase. \n\nBut wait, the trans person might have their own reasons for not disclosing earlier\u2014maybe fear of rejection or coming to terms with their identity themselves. However, the author is now feeling that the trans person was deceptive. \n\nThe author isn't rejecting the person because they're trans per se, but because of their anatomy and attraction. The author is straight, so that's a valid orientation. The key here is whether the trans person was being deceptive. If they were presenting as male and the author didn't know they were trans, then the author's attraction is to the person as they were perceived. Once the truth came out, the author's feelings changed, which is a personal reaction but not necessarily the author's fault.\n\nAlso, the author is trying to maintain the friendship, which shows they don't want to be cruel. The trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong for having different feelings. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong because attraction is subjective, and the trans person didn't disclose something important. However, it's complex because both parties might have valid feelings. But based on the scenario, the author's perspective is that they were misled, which is a common AITA situation where the person isn't wrong for their feelings and decisions.\n"
