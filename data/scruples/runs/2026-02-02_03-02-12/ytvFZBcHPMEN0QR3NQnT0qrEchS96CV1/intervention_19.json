He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a romantic relationship where one person finds out their partner is transgender and then loses attraction, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The trans person didn't disclose their gender identity during the initial stages of the relationship. The author felt lied to because they discovered this information during a sexual encounter. The key question here is whether the trans person had a responsibility to disclose this earlier. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that individuals disclose significant aspects of their identity, especially when it comes to gender, especially in a dating context. However, it's also important to recognize that coming out as transgender can be a deeply personal and challenging process. The trans person might have felt unready or unsafe to share this information earlier.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their personal attraction preferences. They clarify they're strictly straight, so they're not attracted to vaginas. The trans person in this case has a vagina, so the author's lack of attraction is understandable. The author isn't rejecting the person for who they are but for their physical attributes that affect their attraction. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations of being manipulative are concerning. If they didn't disclose their gender identity early on, they can't blame the author for their reaction upon discovering the truth. The author is honest about their preferences and is choosing to maintain a friendship, which shows they're not intentionally harmful. \n\nLegally and ethically, the trans person's failure to disclose might be seen as a lack of transparency, especially if the author's preferences matter. However, the trans person might have valid reasons for not coming out earlier, such as fear of rejection or personal comfort. \n\nThe author's main mistake could be not being aware of the partner's gender identity from the start. However, the responsibility also lies with the trans person to communicate important information that affects the relationship's future. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to personal preferences and lack of attraction. The trans person made a choice not to disclose, which led to the current situation. The author's right to their feelings and choices is valid.\n"
