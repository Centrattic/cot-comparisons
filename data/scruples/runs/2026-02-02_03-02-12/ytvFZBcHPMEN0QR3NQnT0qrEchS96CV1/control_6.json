He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person started going to art school, met a guy they found attractive and compatible. They became close friends, then started dating, leading to physical intimacy. During a make-out session, they realized the guy is trans, specifically that he doesn't have a penis. The author stops, and the guy admits he's trans. The author feels lied to because he didn't disclose this earlier, even though they had been friends for months. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded. Now the guy is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative, which the author thinks is just to hurt them. The author is confused about whether they're in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author did something wrong. The key points here are disclosure of gender identity, attraction, and the reaction from the other person.\n\nGender identity is a personal matter. While some might argue that in a romantic relationship, certain details should be shared upfront, others might say it's not the person's responsibility to disclose unless they feel comfortable. However, if someone is transitioning or presenting as a different gender, there might be an expectation of transparency, but that can vary. The author didn't know the guy was trans until that intimate moment. The guy had months to tell him, but didn't. The author feels lied to, which suggests a breach of trust. But is the guy actually lying, or just not revealing something? If he presented as male and his identity is non-binary or trans male, maybe he didn't feel the need to disclose. But if he's a trans woman, then presenting as male and not disclosing genital differences could be a different scenario. However, the author's main issue is the lack of disclosure before intimacy.\n\nThe author's response is that they're not attracted to vaginas and are straight. Their attraction faded after the disclosure. The author wants to continue being friends but not pursue a romantic relationship. The other person is upset, calling the author names. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, does the author have a right to feel that way? Attraction is subjective. If someone's gender identity becomes a factor in the author's attraction, that's their personal choice. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. However, the other person might feel betrayed if the author ended the relationship based on something they didn't know. But since the trans person didn't disclose, maybe the fault isn't on the author. The author acted on their own feelings and the information they just learned. The author isn't lying or manipulating; they're being honest about their preferences after the fact. The trans person might have been expected to disclose earlier if gender was a factor for the author, but since the author didn't know, they can't be blamed for the reaction. The author's actions are in response to new information. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
