He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a crush who is transgender, and the author losing attraction after learning the trans identity.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, then started dating. The romantic relationship was getting serious when the author discovered the person is trans. The author felt lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded. The trans person is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question their own actions.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The trans person's disclosure timing is an issue. They didn't tell the author earlier, which the author found important. However, the author is also in a position where their attraction changed after the disclosure. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nI should consider the trans person's perspective. They might have waited to disclose because they were nervous or had a reason. But the author had the right to know if they were going to pursue a romantic relationship. The author's attraction is a personal preference, and while it's unfortunate, it's their right to be honest about their preferences.\n\nThe trans person's reaction (calling the author evil and manipulative) seems harsh and possibly a projection of their own hurt. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship, as they made their preferences clear after the disclosure. The author isn't lying or being manipulative; they're being honest about their feelings post-disclosure.\n\nSo, the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. They can't be expected to change their attraction, and the trans person should have disclosed earlier if that information was crucial. The author's actions are justified.\n"
