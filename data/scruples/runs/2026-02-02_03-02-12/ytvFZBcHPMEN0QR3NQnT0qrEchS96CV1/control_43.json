He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a crush on someone who is transgender, found out they're trans during a sexual encounter, and then lost interest. The person argues they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they don't want to continue the relationship. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't know the person was trans until the encounter. The trans person didn't disclose this earlier, which the author feels was a lie. The author isn't attracted to women and the trans person's anatomy affected their attraction. The author wants to stay friends but the other person is angry.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The trans person's disclosure timing is a big factor. If they had known earlier, the author might have made a different choice. But the trans person might have felt the need to build trust before sharing such personal information. On the other hand, the author might have felt that the trans person didn't share something crucial, leading to a loss of trust.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their sexual orientation. They clarify they're straight and not attracted to vaginas. So, their feelings are genuine in that context. The trans person might feel they were being judged, but the author isn't being offensive, just honest about their preferences.\n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations of being manipulative might be a hurtful response, but the author isn't at fault for their lack of attraction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. Since the author isn't attracted to the trans person's anatomy, which they weren't aware of, it's a valid reason to not continue. The author isn't being mean, just honest about their feelings. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
