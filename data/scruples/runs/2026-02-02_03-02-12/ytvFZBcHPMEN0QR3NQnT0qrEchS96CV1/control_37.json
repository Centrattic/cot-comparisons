He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the provided \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to a broken relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they were in a dating relationship with someone who later revealed they were trans. The author states they are strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. They felt lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier. Now, the author wants to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship, but the other person is upset and called them names.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship after finding out about their crush's trans identity. \n\nFrom a general perspective, people have the right to their own attractions and boundaries. The author isn't being discriminatory here because they're clear that their attraction is to men. However, the trans person's experience of not disclosing their identity until a sexual encounter might be problematic. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue a romantic relationship after discovering something that isn't aligned with their preferences. \n\nAlso, the trans person's reaction seems extreme, calling the author names. The author didn't force the relationship; they stopped when they realized their attraction wasn't there. The fact that the trans person withheld information about their identity until that point might be the root of the issue. The author's decision to end the romantic part is a personal choice, not malicious. \n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. Their decision is based on their own feelings and preferences, and they didn't act with malice. The trans person might need to reflect on why they didn't disclose their identity sooner, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
