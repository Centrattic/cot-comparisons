He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about finding out their crush is trans and then losing attraction. The author is wondering if they're an asshole for not continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and their crush were in a romantic relationship that started as friends. The author only found out the person was trans during a moment when they were about to have sex. They feel like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and isn't attracted to someone with a vagina, so their attraction faded after the reveal. The crush became angry and called the author evil and manipulative.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is about disclosure and honesty in relationships. Typically, when it comes to significant details like gender identity, there's an expectation of honesty, but the timing can be tricky. The crush didn't disclose being trans during the initial stages of the relationship, which the author feels was a big omission. However, the author also didn't ask directly, so maybe they had the chance to disclose but didn't. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for feeling that way. People have different lines about what they consider important in a partner. The author is honest about their attraction being to a penis and not a vagina, so upon finding out, their attraction decreased. That's a personal preference, and it's not wrong to have those boundaries. The crush's reaction of being angry and calling the author names might be more about their own feelings of rejection rather than the author doing something wrong. \n\nIn relationships, especially romantic ones, people often have certain expectations. If one person is trans and the other is not attracted to that, it's reasonable for the person to decide they don't want to continue. The author didn't manipulate or lie; they were honest about their feelings after the fact. The crush's anger seems misplaced. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had the right to know, and their reaction is understandable given their orientation. The key is the lack of prior disclosure, which the author felt was important but wasn't shared until a critical moment. The author's decision to step back isn't malicious, just based on their personal preferences.\n"
