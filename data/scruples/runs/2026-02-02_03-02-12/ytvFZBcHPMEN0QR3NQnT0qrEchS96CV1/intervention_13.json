He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for finding out their crush is trans and then no longer being attracted. The situation is that they were in a relationship with someone they thought was male, then discovered he was trans (no penis), which made them lose attraction. The person is now angry, calling the author evil.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author wasn't told that the person is trans until close to a sexual encounter. The person had months to disclose this information. The author's main issue is that they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the lack of a penis is a dealbreaker. The author didn't realize the person was trans until that moment, which made them feel lied to. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The trans person didn't disclose their status early on, which the author feels is important. The author isn't rejecting the person's identity, just their physical attributes. The author wants to remain friends but not pursue a relationship anymore. \n\nOn one hand, the author is honest about their preferences. It's not uncommon for people to have specific attractions. On the other hand, the author might be seen as being dismissive of the person's identity, but the key here is that the author didn't know and only found out later. \n\nThe trans person's anger might be because they felt they were open, but maybe they didn't disclose early enough. The author is not trying to be cruel; they're just dealing with their own feelings. The author isn't in the wrong for having different preferences. However, it's important to approach such situations with empathy. The author could have handled the situation more sensitively, but the core issue is about personal attraction, which is subjective.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). The author's actions are based on their own feelings and lack of prior knowledge. The trans person's choice to disclose later might have contributed to the misunderstanding. The author isn't being offensive about being trans, just their anatomy. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here.\n"
