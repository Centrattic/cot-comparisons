He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves them finding out their crush is trans and suddenly losing attraction, leading to a breakup and some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author started a relationship with a trans man, assuming he was cisgender. They didn't know about his trans status until a sexual encounter. The author states they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. They feel like they were lied to because the trans man didn't disclose his status earlier. Now, the author wants to remain friends but the other person is upset and angry, calling them names like \"evil.\"\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in many cases, people might not disclose their trans status if they're in a relationship where the other person doesn't ask. The author didn't explicitly ask about his gender identity. The trans man might have been open about it if he felt comfortable, but maybe he didn't want to reveal it early on. There's a balance between respecting someone's privacy and the right to know important information for intimacy.\n\nHowever, the author is now choosing not to continue the relationship based on the trans status, which could be seen as discriminatory. The trans individual might have felt that his identity is a part of who he is, and the author's rejection might be based on the fact that he's trans, not his personality. But the author argues they're straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference. They might not have known he was trans because he presented as male, so maybe they weren't in a position to know.\n\nThe author isn't lying or hiding something; they're being honest about their attractions now that they know. However, the way the trans man felt about not disclosing earlier could be a point of contention. But if he didn't feel safe to share that information before, maybe the fault isn't entirely his. The author's reaction might be about their own preferences rather than any wrongdoing. They're also trying to maintain friendship, which shows they don't want to be malicious.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans man's anger might stem from feeling rejected based on his identity, which can be hurtful. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they're being truthful about their feelings. It's a situation where both people have their own perspectives, but the author's decision is based on personal attraction, which they can't control.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. The key is that the author's choice is based on their own sexual orientation and the information they received. They're not being deceptive; they're being honest about their feelings post-disclosure. The trans man might have a right to be upset, but the author isn't the sole one at fault.\n"
