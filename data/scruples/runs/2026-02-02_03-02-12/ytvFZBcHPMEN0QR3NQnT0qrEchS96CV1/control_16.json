He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for losing attraction to their crush after finding out he's trans. The key points here are about honesty, attraction, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that their friend never disclosed being trans despite months of friendship and a developing relationship. They feel like it was a lie because the person didn't share such an important detail. The user is straight and specifically attracted to penises, which makes sense. They didn't know about his identity, so when they found out during a sexual situation, it changed their feelings. \n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, attraction to someone based on specific traits is personal. If the trans person had been honest from the start, maybe the user could have made a different choice. But since the information came up at a crucial moment, it's understandable that their feelings shifted. The user is trying to maintain the friendship while ending the romantic relationship, which shows they care about the friendship despite the change in attraction.\n\nOn the other hand, the trans person might feel hurt because he shared personal information later. But he did have time to disclose his identity earlier. However, not everyone chooses to reveal such information upfront, especially if they're in a place where they feel safe. The user isn't being malicious; they're reacting to a new piece of information that changes their perception. \n\nThe trans person's reaction being angry and calling the user names is problematic. That's not a healthy response, but it's part of the situation. The user isn't responsible for the other person's emotional response. They're not in the wrong for not wanting to continue a romantic relationship once they learned something important about the person's identity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're dealing with a personal reaction to new information and trying to navigate their feelings honestly.\n"
