He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user met someone at art school, became friends, and then developed a romantic relationship. They were dating, making out, cuddling, and things were getting physical. The user found out that their crush is trans, specifically that he doesn't have a penis, which made them lose attraction. They stopped the interaction and wanted to stay friends, but the crush is upset and called them evil and manipulative.\n\nFirst, I should consider when the trans identity was disclosed. The user says the guy had months to tell them but didn't. The user's issue is that they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the revelation affected their attraction. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after finding out.\n\nIn relationships, especially when it comes to romantic and sexual aspects, honesty about one's identity is important. If someone is trans, they might or might not disclose that early on, depending on their comfort and the stage of the relationship. The user didn't know until the physical encounter. The guy might have had the option to tell them earlier, but he chose not to. The user's reaction is about their personal preference in attraction, which is valid. Being straight means they're attracted to men, so if their crush is a trans man, he is a man in identity, even if his anatomy is different. But the user is focusing on the physical aspect here. \n\nThe user didn't express any malicious intent. They immediately stopped the interaction upon realizing and had a conversation about it. They also mention they wanted to continue being friends. The problem is the guy is now angry and calling them names, which complicates things. The user is questioning if their reaction is justified. \n\nI think the key points are: the guy didn't disclose his trans status early, the user's attraction is based on specific anatomy, and the user is trying to maintain the friendship. The user's actions don't seem malicious, they're reacting to a personal preference. The guy might have done something wrong by not being upfront, but the user isn't in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. People have different boundaries, and if the guy didn't share that information before a certain point, the user isn't obligated to continue. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
