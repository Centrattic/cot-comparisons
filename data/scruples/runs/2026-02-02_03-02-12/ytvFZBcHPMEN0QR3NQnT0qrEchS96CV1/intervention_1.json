He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a crush on someone they found attractive and they started a relationship. The person they were pursuing is trans, and the author only found out when they were about to have sex. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity earlier, and now the author isn't attracted anymore. They want to be friends but the other person is upset and called them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The trans person didn't mention their identity until the moment of intimacy. The author is straight and now feels like they can't continue the relationship. Did the trans person have a responsibility to disclose earlier? On the other hand, the author also didn't ask about it, so is it fair to expect the other person to volunteer that information?\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but what counts as necessary information? Gender identity is a significant aspect of someone's identity. However, the trans person might have felt vulnerable and chosen to reveal it when they felt safe. The author might have assumed the other person was cisgender, which is common unless someone specifies otherwise.\n\nThe author's reaction is to stop the relationship because they aren't attracted to someone without a penis. That's their personal preference, which is valid. But the other person is upset, thinking the author is manipulative. Is the author wrong for not continuing? The author is being honest about their feelings, even if it's hurtful. \n\nBut did the trans person wait too long to disclose? If they had mentioned it earlier, the author might have still chosen to pursue the relationship. However, it's also possible that the author would have ended it then. The trans person's decision to disclose at the point of intimacy might be due to their own anxiety or fear of rejection. \n\nIn terms of ethics, both parties have their own challenges. The author isn't in the wrong for having specific attraction preferences. The trans person isn't in the wrong for not disclosing upfront unless they had a clear reason to think it was necessary. The author's decision to end the relationship is their right, even if it's difficult for the other person. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
