He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is trans and then losing attraction, leading to a breakup and some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and the trans person became friends, then developed a romantic relationship. The author didn't know the person was trans until during an intimate moment. The author feels lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this earlier. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so after finding out, the attraction faded. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom what I know, being transgender is about a person's gender identity. The trans person in the story likely identifies as male, which would align with the author's initial perception. However, the author didn't know about the transition until that moment. The trans person might have been in the process of transitioning, and perhaps hadn't shared that information yet. \n\nThe author's main issue is about disclosure. They feel that the trans person didn't share important information that affects the author's attraction. But is it the trans person's responsibility to disclose that before a relationship becomes serious? Or is it the author's responsibility to understand that gender identity might not be visible and to communicate their own boundaries?\n\nIn many cases, people disclose their gender identity when they feel comfortable. It's possible the trans person was still coming to terms with it themselves or was unsure how the author would react. The author, on the other hand, is now realizing their attraction is only to cisgender men and not trans men. That's a personal preference, and it's not inherently wrong to have those preferences, as long as the person isn't discriminating based on prejudice.\n\nThe trans person's reaction seems harsh\u2014calling the author evil and manipulative. That's not a healthy response, but the author's decision to end the relationship because of their attraction isn't necessarily the fault of the author. However, the author could have handled the situation more sensitively. For example, instead of stopping the relationship abruptly and causing hurt feelings, maybe discussing their feelings earlier.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship after learning about the trans identity. Since the author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, their feelings are based on their own sexuality. They aren't being malicious; they just realized the relationship isn't what they want. The trans person didn't lie if they genuinely identified as male and hadn't mentioned the transition, so the author isn't being lied to in a deceptive way. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a responsibility to consider that not everyone presents as cisgender and to communicate their comfort levels earlier in the relationship. But in this case, the author didn't know until the intimate moment. So, the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings, but they might be at fault for not addressing the issue earlier or for how they ended the relationship. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether they could have handled it better.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because their feelings are based on their own sexuality, and the trans person had the right to self-identify. The author isn't obligated to change their preferences, and it's not their fault that the trans person didn't disclose earlier. The main conflict arises from the trans person's emotional response and the author's right to their own attractions.\n"
