He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the author discovers their crush is transgender and then loses attraction, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, the author's partner is trans. The author didn't know about his gender identity until they were about to have sex. The key point here is whether the partner misrepresented his identity. Since he was open about being trans eventually, but didn't disclose it earlier, maybe there's an issue of timing. But in many cases, people don't feel comfortable sharing such personal information right away.\n\nThe author feels lied to, but the partner might have been waiting for the right time. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the physical aspect is a problem. The author wants to stay friends but not pursue a relationship anymore. The partner is upset and accused the author of being manipulative, which seems harsh.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: they had feelings, but the attraction changed upon discovering the trans identity. They didn't push the partner to reveal it, but when they found out, they stopped the interaction. It's a personal preference about attraction, which is valid. The partner's reaction of calling them evil and faking the friendship seems disproportionate and maybe a defense mechanism.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't force the partner to reveal anything. The partner chose not to share earlier. The author's decision to not continue the relationship is based on personal attraction, which isn't something they can control. The author is also trying to maintain the friendship, which is respectful. The partner's anger and accusations are more concerning here.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They acted based on their feelings and preferences, and the partner's behavior seems more problematic.\n"
