He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author started a relationship with someone they thought was male, later found out the person is trans (gender male but with a female body), and now isn't attracted to them anymore. They're feeling like they were lied to because the trans person didn't disclose this information earlier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the trans person's perspective. Transitioning is a deeply personal process. Some trans individuals might not disclose their gender identity until they feel comfortable or until it's necessary. There's also the aspect of safety and trust involved here. The author mentions that they were friends for a long time, so maybe the trans person wasn't ready to share that part of themselves yet. Also, the author states they're strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas. In that case, the author's reaction makes sense from their own perspective, even if it's not ideal.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't know the person was trans, and they had a relationship based on that. When they found out, they felt their attraction was gone. The trans person is upset and called the author names. The author is now questioning their own actions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't being deceptive. They had a genuine connection and when they found out a fact that changed their feelings, they made a decision based on their own preferences. However, the trans person might feel that their identity was a deal-breaker, but that's not the same as the author being wrong. The author didn't know, so it's not a lie or deceit from their side. The trans person might have had the choice to disclose earlier, but it's not always straightforward. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have been more understanding. But the author is clear that they're not attracted to vaginas, which is a personal preference. They also mention that maybe if the trans person had told them earlier, they could have worked through it, but it's speculative. The author isn't rejecting the person's identity; they're rejecting the physical aspect that affects their attraction. \n\nThe trans person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected based on their identity, which is a real and valid hurt. However, the author isn't in the wrong for having their own preferences. It's a matter of compatibility. The question is whether the author acted wrongly by ending the relationship. Since they didn't know and it's a personal attraction issue, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They're honest about their feelings, even if it's painful for everyone involved.\n"
