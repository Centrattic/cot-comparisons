He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not being attracted to their trans crush anymore after finding out they're trans. \n\nFirst, the author met someone they liked, and they developed a relationship. They went on dates, made out, and almost had sex. Then, during a moment of intimacy, they discovered the person is trans. The author felt lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans status earlier. Now, the author isn't attracted anymore and wants to just be friends, but the other person is upset and called them names.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author isn't in the wrong for being straight and not being attracted to a vagina. Attraction is personal, and it's not their fault they're not into it. The trans person didn't disclose their status early on, which is a big deal because gender identity is an important part of a relationship. If they had known earlier, maybe the author could have adjusted their feelings. But since it came up during a sexual encounter, it's understandable the author felt misled. \n\nThe author also says they want to stay friends, which shows they're not malicious. The other person's reaction seems extreme, calling them evil and manipulative without cause. The author isn't the one being wrong here. They didn't hide their preferences; they just had a change in attraction after a significant detail was revealed. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The trans person should have been honest from the start, and the author's feelings are valid. The other person's anger is misplaced.\n"
