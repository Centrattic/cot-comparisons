He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author met someone at art school, they became friends, developed a relationship that was becoming romantic and sexual. The author found out the person was trans, and now they're not attracted to them anymore. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for this reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the author did. They didn't know the person was trans until right before a sexual encounter. The person didn't disclose their trans identity earlier, even though they were close friends and in a dating-like situation. The author feels lied to because they think the information was withheld too late. They like the person but aren't straight, so they can't be attracted to a vagina. The author wants to stay friends but not pursue a romantic relationship anymore. The person they were dating is upset and accused them of being evil and manipulative.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: 1) Did the trans person have a responsibility to disclose their identity earlier? 2) Is the author wrong for not being attracted to someone because they're trans? 3) Did the author act in a way that was unfair or harmful?\n\nFrom what I know, being transgender is part of someone's identity, and while it's not a deal-breaker for everyone, it's a personal choice. The trans person might have waited to come out until they felt comfortable or in a more stable relationship. However, if the author's orientation is strictly straight, then the attraction is a natural limitation. The author isn't choosing to be transphobic; they're expressing their preference. \n\nThe author didn't know the person was trans until the moment, which might have been when they felt the situation was too far along. The author stopped the encounter, which shows they respected the person. They also want to continue the friendship, which is considerate. The other person's anger and accusations might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author wrong for their feelings. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, but the timing of disclosures can depend on the relationship's stage. If the trans person waited until the relationship was more serious to come out, maybe that's when they felt safe. However, the author's reaction is about their own attraction, which is valid. They're not discriminating based on stereotypes but acknowledging their preferences. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone who's trans. They handled it by stopping the situation and wanting to maintain the friendship. The other person's anger might reflect their own feelings of rejection or societal stigma rather than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
