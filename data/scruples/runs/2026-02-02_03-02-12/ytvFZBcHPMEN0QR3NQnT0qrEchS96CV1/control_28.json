He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves them finding out their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to the end of their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context. The author met someone at art school, became friends, developed a romantic relationship, and then during an intimate moment, discovered the person is trans. The key points here are the timing of the revelation and the author's reaction. The trans person didn't disclose their identity earlier, and the author feels lied to. They mention being strictly straight and not attracted to vaginas, so they ended the relationship. The trans person is upset and accused the author of being manipulative.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Was the trans person obligated to disclose their identity earlier? In many cases, people disclose such personal information when they feel comfortable. However, if the relationship was progressing towards a physical level, maybe there's an expectation of honesty about such a significant aspect of one's identity. But on the other hand, not everyone discloses their entire past or gender identity immediately, especially if they're not asked. The author might have assumed the person was cisgender, which is a common default in many societies.\n\nThe author's reaction: they felt lied to, which is a common reaction when information significantly affects one's feelings. However, the author also acknowledges that maybe if the trans person had told them earlier, they might have worked through it. But since the revelation happened during intimacy, they couldn't. The author then ended the relationship, which is their right, but the trans person is upset and lashing out, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the trans person didn't disclose, but the author didn't ask, is that on the author? The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting a relationship with someone they're not attracted to. However, the way the relationship ended might affect the answer. If the trans person felt they were being honest once the relationship got intimate, maybe the author's reaction was too harsh. But the author isn't obligated to be attracted to someone just because they're trans. Also, the trans person's anger and accusations might be misplaced, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nLegally and ethically, the trans person's identity is a personal matter they can choose when to share. The author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to lack of attraction. However, if the trans person felt they were being deceptive by not disclosing earlier, that's a separate issue. But the author can't be blamed for their own feelings and preferences. So the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
