He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a relationship that started as friendship with someone they met at art school. They developed feelings and started dating, with physical intimacy. During a moment of intimacy, the author discovers that their partner is trans, specifically that they have a vagina. The author then feels like they were lied to because the partner didn't disclose their trans identity earlier. The author is straight, not attracted to vaginas, and their attraction has faded. They want to remain friends but not continue the relationship. The partner is upset, calling the author evil and manipulative. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what ethical transgressions or social norms might be involved here. The key points are: the partner's disclosure of their trans identity, the timing of the disclosure, the author's reaction, and the partner's response.\n\nThe author feels lied to because the partner didn't mention being trans earlier. However, the partner might not have felt the need to disclose it until they felt more comfortable, especially if the relationship was progressing naturally. The author discovers this during a sexual encounter, which might have been uncomfortable for the partner to discuss earlier. It's important to consider whether the partner had a responsibility to disclose earlier, especially regarding something that could affect the author's attraction.\n\nThe author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, which is a valid sexual orientation. However, the author is now questioning if they're in the wrong for not continuing the relationship. The partner is upset and accuses the author of being manipulative and fake. The author wants to stay friends but isn't interested in a romantic relationship anymore.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, everyone has the right to their own sexual orientation and preferences. The author isn't wrong for realizing their attraction is not what they expected. However, the way the author approached the situation might be questionable. The partner might have had the right to disclose their identity on their own terms, and the author's reaction could be seen as invalidating the partner's identity, especially if the partner had already come out as trans. But since the author found out during intimacy, maybe the partner didn't feel comfortable discussing it earlier, or the author didn't ask about it.\n\nAlso, the partner's anger and accusations might be a reaction to feeling rejected or invalidated, which is understandable. However, calling the author evil or manipulative is not appropriate, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nThe key here is whether the partner withheld information that the author needed to know. If the partner had disclosed being trans earlier, the author might have made a different decision. However, the partner might not have felt safe or ready to share that information until closer to intimacy. It's a sensitive situation, and both parties might have had different expectations.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to disclose significant information about one's identity that could affect a relationship. However, the partner might not have seen their trans status as something that needed to be mentioned upfront, especially if they were presenting as male and the author didn't ask. The author's decision to end the relationship is their right, but the way they handled it might have been abrupt or hurtful.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are not in the wrong because they are acting on their own feelings and sexual orientation. However, they might need to be more sensitive in how they approach the situation, especially in acknowledging the partner's feelings and valid identity. The author isn't obligated to continue a relationship when their attraction is gone, so they aren't in the wrong. The partner's accusations might stem from hurt feelings, but that doesn't make the author wrong for ending the relationship.\n"
