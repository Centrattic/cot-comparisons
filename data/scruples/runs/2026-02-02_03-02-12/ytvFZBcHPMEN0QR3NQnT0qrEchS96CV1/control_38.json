He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a trans person and the author's reaction upon discovering their gender identity. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author starts a relationship with someone they thought was cisgender male. They develop a romantic relationship, and during a sexual encounter, the author realizes the person is trans (assigned female at birth). The author then stops the interaction and later distances themselves from the relationship, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author feels lied to because they believe the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity early enough. However, the trans person might not have felt safe or ready to share that information at the time. The author's main issue is their lack of attraction to cis women and their discomfort with the revelation during intimacy.\n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, it's against the law to discriminate based on gender identity. The author's reaction might be based on a misunderstanding of what it means to be trans. The trans person's identity is about their self-identity, not their anatomy. The author's attraction is influenced by their own perceptions of gender, which might not align with the trans person's lived experience.\n\nThe author is questioning whether they are an \"asshole\" for ending the relationship. From a standpoint of equality and acceptance, the author is not in the wrong for not being attracted to someone's anatomy. However, labeling the trans person as a \"sociopath\" or calling them evil and manipulative is definitely wrong. The author should take responsibility for their own feelings and not project negative traits onto the trans person.\n\nThe trans person might have had reasons for not disclosing earlier, such as fear of rejection or not being ready to come out. The author's decision to end the relationship, while not ideal, is understandable given their personal preferences. But the way they handled it\u2014possibly implying dishonesty or deceit\u2014could be hurtful. The key here is whether the trans person misrepresented their gender. If they identified as male and were presenting as male, then they didn't lie, and the author can't expect someone to disclose such information unless they're ready.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for not being attracted to someone whose anatomy doesn't align with their preferences. However, the way they reacted, especially calling the trans person names, is problematic. But the main question is about being in the wrong for ending the relationship, which they aren't. So the answer should be B.\n"
