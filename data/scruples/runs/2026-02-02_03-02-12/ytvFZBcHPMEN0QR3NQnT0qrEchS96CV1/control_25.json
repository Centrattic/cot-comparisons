He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is transgender and subsequently losing attraction, leading to the end of the relationship. The author is being called evil and manipulative by the other person, which is complicating things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author didn't know the person was trans before the relationship became physical. They mention that the person had months to reveal this information but didn't. The author is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the physical aspect is a deal-breaker. The main question is whether it's wrong to end the relationship after discovering this.\n\nTransgender individuals often have the right to their privacy, especially if they were in the process of transitioning or hadn't disclosed their gender identity yet. However, when a relationship is progressing toward intimacy, certain expectations might come into play. The author felt lied to because the person didn't disclose their trans status earlier. But the person might have felt ready to transition or not wanted to share that part before a certain point.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on their personal preferences. They state they're strictly straight, so the physical aspect not aligning with their attraction is a valid personal choice. However, the way the situation unfolded could be a point of contention. The author stopped the interaction when they realized the physical differences, which might be seen as a natural response to their lack of attraction. \n\nThe other person's anger and accusations of being evil or manipulative are concerning. That reaction might indicate that they felt the author was deliberate in their rejection, but if the author didn't know beforehand, that's not the case. The key here is whether the author intentionally sought to harm or mislead, which seems not to be the situation. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial, but so is respecting one's boundaries and attractions. The author might not be in the wrong for ending things if they're not attracted to the person. However, the timing and the way they discovered the trans status could be a gray area. It's possible the author didn't get the necessary information to make an informed decision about the relationship, which the other person might view as a betrayal. \n\nBut considering that the author was clear about being straight and that the other person didn't disclose a key part of their identity before the relationship became physical, the author's choice to end the relationship isn't necessarily their fault. The other person's actions of not disclosing might have been the real issue here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship once they realized the trans aspect, especially if it was a significant factor in their attraction. The answer should be B.\n"
