He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for finding out their crush is trans and then not being attracted anymore. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is in a situation where they developed feelings for someone they thought was male. They formed a close relationship, including physical intimacy, and then discovered the person is trans. The user feels like they were lied to because the person didn't disclose this earlier. The user is straight and not attracted to vaginas, so their attraction faded after the revelation. The trans person is upset and accused the user of being manipulative. The user is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm, the key points here are honesty and communication. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until a very intimate moment. The user might feel that this was a critical piece of information they needed to know before pursuing a romantic relationship. But is the user in the wrong for not continuing the relationship after finding out?\n\nTrans people often struggle with when and how to come out. Some might wait until they feel a certain level of trust. The user might not have known, so the trans person not disclosing earlier could be seen as withholding information. However, the user is straight and their attraction is based on certain physical traits. If the user's orientation is strictly towards men, then the trans person's identity might not align with their preferences. \n\nBut wait, if the trans person identifies as male, then technically they are male. So maybe the user's issue is with the physical aspect, not the gender identity. The user is not attracted to vaginas, which is a different issue. However, the trans person might have undergone some transition steps, so the user might not have known. The problem arises when the user discovers this during a moment of intimacy and then ends the relationship.\n\nIs the user in the wrong for not continuing the relationship? Probably not. They had a change in attraction based on new information. That's a valid reason. The trans person might feel hurt because they thought the relationship was progressing, but the user's lack of attraction is a personal preference. The user isn't being malicious; they're just realizing they're not interested in the same way anymore. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected or not being accepted, but the user isn't obligated to be attracted. \n\nHowever, the user's statement about feeling lied to is tricky. If the trans person presented as male and didn't explicitly mention their transition, the user might not have known. But if the user felt the person was hiding something, that's a communication issue. The user could have asked earlier if they had any concerns, but they didn't. Still, the user's reaction is based on their own preferences, which are valid. \n\nSo putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship due to a change in attraction after discovering the trans identity. The trans person might have handled their coming out differently, but the user's response is a personal choice, not a moral failing. The answer should be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
