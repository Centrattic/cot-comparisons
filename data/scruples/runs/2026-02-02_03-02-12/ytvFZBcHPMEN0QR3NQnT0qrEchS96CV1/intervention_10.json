He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who found out their crush is trans and then lost attraction. They're being called names by the other person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they started dating and had a good friendship. The trans person didn't disclose their identity until the moment before a sexual encounter. The author feels lied to because they consider that information important. They\u2019re straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the attraction faded after finding out. Now, the other person is upset and accusing the author of being evil and manipulative.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's main issue is about the lack of disclosure. In relationships, honesty is crucial. If someone doesn't share something they consider vital, that can feel like a betrayal. The author isn't rejecting the person for being trans; they're clear they're straight and that their attraction is based on having a penis. It's their right to choose their partners based on their orientation.\n\nThe trans person might have been nervous about disclosing early, which is understandable, but withholding such a significant detail when it's directly relevant to the relationship could be a problem. The author isn't saying they don't care about the trans person's struggles, just that the information was important to them. \n\nThe other person's reaction seems extreme. Calling the author names and claiming they faked the friendship might be a defense mechanism or an attempt to deflect blame. The author is honest about their feelings and wants to maintain a friendship, which is considerate. They\u2019re not attacking the person\u2019s identity but their lack of transparency.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re being truthful about their feelings and orientation. The trans person might need to take responsibility for not communicating earlier. The answer should be B.\n"
