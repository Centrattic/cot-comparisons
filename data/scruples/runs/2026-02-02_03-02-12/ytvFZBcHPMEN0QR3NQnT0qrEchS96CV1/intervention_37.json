He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they found out their crush is transgender and then lost interest, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and the trans person were friends for months, developing a romantic relationship. The author didn't know the person was trans until they were about to have sex. The author now feels they were lied to because the person didn't disclose being trans earlier. They feel their attraction faded, and they want to remain friends but not pursue a relationship. The trans person is upset and called the author names.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The trans person's experience is important. Transitioning or being open about one's identity is a personal journey. Maybe the trans person wasn't ready to share that information earlier, or perhaps they didn't consider it relevant at the time. The author's response is based on their attraction (straight), which is a personal preference. However, the author is now labeling the trans person as a sociopath, which is harmful and not based on facts.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't know the person was trans and didn't have the chance to make an informed choice. However, the trans person didn't disclose their gender identity, which the author considers important. The author's reaction\u2014feeling lied to\u2014is valid if they expected full disclosure for a romantic relationship. On the other hand, the trans person might have felt they needed to be themselves when comfortable.\n\nBut the author's conclusion that they're not in the wrong is based on their preference. The key is whether the trans person withheld information that the author needed for consent. However, the author's attraction is a personal choice. The trans person might have been honest once the situation came up, so maybe the author isn't wrong for not wanting to continue the relationship. However, calling the trans person a sociopath is definitely inconsiderate.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the trans person's non-disclosure was a lie. If they were being honest but hadn't mentioned it before, maybe the author isn't wrong for needing that information. But the author's harsh judgment and the conflict's handling might be their fault. However, the main issue is the author's right to their feelings. Since attraction is subjective, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not being attracted. The trans person's reaction might be overblown. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
