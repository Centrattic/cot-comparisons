He seemed to genuinely like me as a person and we became good friends. We hung out often and I felt like I was making a real connection with someone. \n\nWe both started developing am attracting for each other after a couple months of being friends. Hanging out became the equivalent of dates. We would make out, cuddle, take naps together, etc. I guess I would classify it as we were dating. We had been very good friends for months at this point. \n\nWell, people who are attracted to each other tend to want to have sex with each other. Our make-out sessions were getting very hot and heavy, and it kept escalating to the point where we were about to have sex. I go to unbutton his pants, and I notice there\u2019s no bulge whatsoever. Well, maybe he wasn\u2019t hard yet. I unzip his pants and notice he literally does not have a penis. \n\nI look up at him quizzically and he just goes \u201coh yeah...\u201d That was the moment I found out he was trans. I stopped immediately and we started talking about it, and he told me how hard it was for him to be who he is, and I understand that.\n\nThe thing is, I feel almost lied to. He had months to tell me the truth and yet he continued to pursue a romantic relationship with me, leaving out something I deem very important. I don\u2019t want to sound offensive but I\u2019m strictly straight. I\u2019m not attracted to vagina at all. I want to have sex with a penis, if that makes sense. MAYBE if he would\u2019ve told me a long time ago about it, I would\u2019ve been able to overcome it since I liked him so much. But to find out on the spot like that? I don\u2019t know. \n\nMy attracting for him has faded substantially and I would like to continue being friends with him, but nothing more, because it\u2019s just not what I\u2019m looking for. He is now very mad and upset with me because I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship with him. He called me an evil and manipulative person, but then in the same breath says he faked our entire friendship? I think he said that just to try and hurt me but now I\u2019m seeing him as a sociopath of sorts. I\u2019m just overwhelmed and flabbergasted at what happened! Am I in the wrong? Am I an asshole for not continuing the relationship? Am I evil and manipulative? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discovering that their crush is trans and losing attraction, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met someone at art school, became friends, and things turned romantic. They were in a dating-like situation, got physical, and then found out the person is trans during a moment of intimacy. The author feels lied to because the trans identity wasn't disclosed earlier. They're straight and not attracted to vaginas, so the connection faded. The other person is upset and called the author names, leading the author to question their own actions.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author didn't know the person was trans until that intimate moment. The trans person didn't disclose their identity before the relationship became serious. The author is straight, so their attraction is based on a penis. Since the author only found out during the act, they stopped and explained their feelings. They want to remain friends but not pursue a romantic relationship.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the trans person didn't inform them about their identity before intimacy. The author had a right to know, especially since sexual orientation and anatomy matter for them. The author isn't rejecting the person's identity; they just aren't attracted to a vagina. The trans person's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their preferences. The key here is consent and transparency. The trans person didn't share their identity early enough, leading to the author's confusion and loss of attraction. The author's response is about their own feelings, not the other person's identity. So, the answer is B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
