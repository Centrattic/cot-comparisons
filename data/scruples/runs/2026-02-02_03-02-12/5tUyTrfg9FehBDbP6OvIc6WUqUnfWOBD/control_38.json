I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the boyfriend apparently didn't know. The sister had been in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp's victim. The author believed that hiding this from the boyfriend was wrong, so they told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had the right to disclose that information. The sister's privacy is a key factor here. Even though the author might have good intentions, sharing someone's personal and traumatic history without their consent can be a breach of trust. The sister might have chosen not to tell the boyfriend for her own reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, or maybe she's trying to move on. The author stepping in might have violated that boundary.\n\nThen, the boyfriend's reaction. He got angry and yelled, but maybe that was because he was shocked or felt misled. The author's action led to a breakdown in the family relationship, with the sister cutting ties. That's a serious consequence. The author might argue that they were being honest and protecting their sister's future, but the method was questionable. \n\nAlso, the author didn't consult the sister before telling the boyfriend. It's possible the sister had a reason to keep that part of her life private, even if the author didn't agree with her judgment. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend knew, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was right to disclose it. \n\nSo, the main points are: breach of privacy, lack of consent, and the consequences of revealing a traumatic history. The author might have been trying to help, but the approach was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
