I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the right thing by telling the sister's boyfriend about the abuse. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, and the author felt she wasn't being honest with the new boyfriend. The author's parents weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew about the past, so the author decided to inform him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the sister's past abuse, the author's concern about her not disclosing this to her current partner, and the author's decision to reveal the truth. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, leading to the sister severing ties.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from what they saw as a harmful situation. However, the sister had the right to privacy, and the author might have overstepped by not consulting her first. Even if the author suspected the sister wasn't truthful, revealing personal information without consent can breach trust. The sister's autonomy in her relationship is important\u2014she decides what to share. The author's actions might have been well-meaning but were invasive. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to feeling blindsided, which the author might have anticipated. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The ethical dilemma is between protecting someone from harm versus respecting privacy. In this case, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't seek consent from the sister and directly told the boyfriend, which could be seen as a breach of trust. So, answer A.\n"
