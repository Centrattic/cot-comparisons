I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The situation is complicated. The sister was in an abusive relationship, which is serious. The author felt that the boyfriend should know because it's a major factor that might affect their relationship. But the sister didn't tell him, and the author took it upon themselves to share that information without her consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister has the right to privacy and to decide what information to share about herself. By not getting her permission, the author violated her privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, the act of disclosing someone's personal trauma without their consent is problematic. It's possible that the sister had her reasons for not telling the boyfriend, maybe she wasn't ready, or perhaps she feared his reaction. The author assumed they knew best, which might not be the case.\n\nThen, there's the reaction of the boyfriend. He got angry and threw the author out, which is understandable if he felt blindsided or if the information was shared in a way that felt invasive. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, which the sister rejected. This escalated the conflict and led to the author being cut off from the sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. Abuse is a serious issue, and the boyfriend should know if he's in a relationship with someone who has such a history. However, the method of disclosure was inappropriate. The right approach would be to encourage the sister to talk to her boyfriend herself, rather than doing it without her consent. The author might have thought they were helping, but crossed a boundary.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy and privacy. Even with good intentions, the action was a breach of trust. The answer should be A.\n"
