I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past is in the wrong. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, who was also her pimp. The author felt the current boyfriend shouldn't be in the dark about such a significant issue, especially since the couple was talking about marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The sister's privacy is a key factor. The author is her sibling, so there's a close relationship, but does that justify sharing personal and sensitive information without consent? The author believed the boyfriend had the right to know because it's a major part of her background that could affect their relationship. However, the sister might have chosen to keep that information private, possibly to protect herself or her current partner from unnecessary stress or judgment.\n\nThen there's the method of disclosure. The author went directly to the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first. That could be seen as overstepping, as the sister might not have wanted her partner to hear about it from a third party. The sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the author\u2014suggests that she felt her privacy was violated. Even if the author's intentions were good, the approach might have been inappropriate.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was anger and hostility, which the author didn't expect. This could indicate that the information was a shock, but the way it was delivered might have contributed to his negative reaction. The author then demanded an apology from the boyfriend, which the sister rejected. The sister's response to the author is extreme, but perhaps the author's actions led to that outcome.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's concern about the boyfriend's awareness is valid, but the sister has the right to control what information she shares about her past. The author's decision to intervene without the sister's consent might have caused more harm than good. \n\nIn similar situations, experts often advise approaching the person directly first to discuss concerns rather than going to a third party. The author didn't give the sister a chance to address the issue with her partner, assuming that the boyfriend needed to know. This lack of communication with the sister herself could be the main point of contention.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might have been to protect the boyfriend and ensure transparency, the method of disclosure and the lack of respect for the sister's autonomy likely made the situation worse. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and handling the situation without her input.\n"
