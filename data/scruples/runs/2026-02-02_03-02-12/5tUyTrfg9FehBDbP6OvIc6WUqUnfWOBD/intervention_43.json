I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimped woman. The author is concerned that the sister might not be telling the whole truth about her agency in that situation. The parents were unsure if the current boyfriend knew about this past. The author decided to inform the boyfriend directly, which led to the boyfriend yelling and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nSo, the main issue here is confidentiality. The author didn't consult the sister before sharing her private information. Even though the author had good intentions, sharing such sensitive details without consent can be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might feel violated that her personal history was disclosed, especially since the boyfriend's reaction was hostile. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to protect their sister and the boyfriend by ensuring he knew about the potential red flags. But the method of disclosure was direct and without the sister's consent. There's a balance between being a concerned sibling and overstepping boundaries. \n\nThe sister's response\u2014cutting off the author\u2014indicates that she values her privacy and autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction might have been due to the suddenness and the way the information was delivered. The author might have thought they were helping, but they didn't consider the sister's perspective on sharing her story.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, there's a difference between sharing information for someone's well-being and respecting their right to privacy. The author's actions could be seen as well-meaning but misguided. The question is whether the author overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. \n\nSo, while the author had intentions to help, the method of disclosure without consent makes them at least partially in the wrong. The sister has the right to control her narrative and decide who to tell about her past. The author's intervention, though from a place of concern, violated that trust.\n"
