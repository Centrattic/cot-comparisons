I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The author's sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out, and she's now dating someone new, possibly for marriage. The author thought it was wrong that the sister didn't tell the boyfriend about this history. The author told the boyfriend, and he reacted badly, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries between family members and their responsibilities to each other. The sister might have a right to privacy regarding her past. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, thinking he should know about the sister's history. But did the author have the right to share that information without the sister's consent?\n\nIn many cases, sharing someone's personal information without their permission, especially if it's sensitive, can be a violation of their privacy. Even if the author believes they're acting out of concern, it's still their sister's story to tell. The boyfriend might have a right to know, but it's the sister's responsibility to share that information with him, not the author's. By stepping in, the author might have overstepped their bounds.\n\nAlso, considering the sister's trauma, the author's actions could have been hurtful. The sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, and the boyfriend's reaction could be due to the shock of hearing it from someone else instead of her. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend adds another layer, as it pressures the boyfriend to respond in a certain way, which might not be fair either.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister is hiding something significant that could affect her partner's decision to marry her, maybe the author had a reason to be concerned. However, the ethical approach would typically be to encourage the sister to be honest herself rather than revealing it to the boyfriend without her consent. The author's method was direct and possibly confrontational, leading to a breakdown in family relationships.\n\nSo, the key points are: privacy violation, overstepping boundaries, lack of consent, and the impact on the sister's relationships. The author's actions, while coming from a place of concern, likely crossed ethical lines by not respecting the sister's autonomy and privacy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
