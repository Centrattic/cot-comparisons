I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about a past abusive relationship that the sister had. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped, and she's now with someone she's serious about. The author told the boyfriend about this history without the sister's consent. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to inform him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister then cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. Consent is a big factor. The sister didn't tell the boyfriend herself, so the author shared it without her permission. Even if the author thought it was for the boyfriend's protection, sharing private family matters without consent can be a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of potential harm. If the boyfriend was unaware of the sister's past, maybe knowing could affect his decision to stay with her. But the author's approach was direct and not discussed with the sister first. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, especially if she chose not to share that information with her boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The line between helping and overstepping can be thin. The author's intention was to be honest, but the method was problematic because it wasn't consensual. \n\nAlso, the sister cutting off the author could be her reaction to the breach of trust, not necessarily the author being entirely in the wrong. But the author's actions did lead to that conflict. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, sharing someone's private information without their consent is generally considered wrong, even if the intention is good. The author might have thought they were right, but the sister had the right to decide what to share about her past. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they disclosed private information without consent, leading to negative consequences.\n"
