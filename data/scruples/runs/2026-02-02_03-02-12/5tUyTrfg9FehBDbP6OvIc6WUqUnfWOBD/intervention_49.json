I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's history of abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was abusive and possibly a pimp. She's now in a serious relationship with a new guy, and the author thinks it's wrong that she hasn't told him about her past. The author then decides to tell the boyfriend directly, which leads to the boyfriend yelling and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author had the right to divulge that information. Let's break it down. The sister's privacy is a big factor. Even if the author is concerned about the new boyfriend's knowledge, the sister has the right to decide when and how to share her past. The author might have thought they were protecting the boyfriend from being misled, but by going behind the sister's back, they violated her trust and privacy.\n\nAnother angle is the author's assumption about the sister's agency. The author isn't sure if the sister had as little agency as she claims. That's a sensitive topic. Even if the author has doubts, that doesn't justify sharing private information without consent. The sister might be dealing with trauma, and sharing her history is a personal choice. The author's decision could have been a breach of that.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also part of the context. They weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe they were in denial or trying to protect the sister. The author might have felt the need to act because of that, but again, the method was problematic.\n\nThe consequences were significant. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author. This shows that the action had a negative impact on relationships. The author's intention might have been to do the right thing, but the approach was invasive and led to more harm than good.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of autonomy is important. People have the right to make decisions about their own lives, including what information to share with their partners. By disclosing the sister's history without her consent, the author undermined her autonomy. Even with good intentions, the action crossed a boundary.\n\nSo considering all this, the author's action was a violation of privacy and trust. The sister should have been the one to decide if and when to tell her boyfriend. The author's decision to step in directly without discussing it with the sister first was the wrong approach. Even if the author believed they were helping, the method used was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
