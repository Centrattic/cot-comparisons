I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp. The author thinks maybe their sister doesn't have as much agency as she claims. The parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about this. The author felt it was wrong for the sister to keep this from her boyfriend, especially since it's a major issue that might affect the relationship.\n\nThe author then told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. The author asked the sister for an apology, but she cut off all contact.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to disclose this information. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were protecting the boyfriend by letting him know about the sister's past. They could believe that the boyfriend had a right to know such a significant detail. However, the sister might have felt that her privacy was violated. The author didn't check with the sister first, assuming maybe she wasn't being truthful about her agency. But without her consent, sharing personal trauma could be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests he wasn't prepared for that information, which might imply he didn't know. But the author's approach might have been too abrupt or confrontational. The sister's response cutting off the author shows the impact of this action.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting someone's well-being and respecting another's autonomy and privacy. The author acted out of concern, but without the sister's permission, it's a breach of trust. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's choice to keep that information private. However, if the author believed the sister was in danger or the boyfriend wasn't aware, there's an argument for their intent being protective. \n\nBut since the sister didn't consent and the method of disclosure caused harm, it's more likely the author overstepped. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
