I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past with abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp. The author thinks maybe the sister isn't being entirely honest about her agency. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about this. The author decided to tell the boyfriend directly, which led to a bad reaction from him and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose such sensitive information. On one hand, the sister's past is a significant detail that affects her current relationship. The author's intention might have been to protect the boyfriend from being in a potentially harmful situation. But, did the author have the right to share that information without the sister's consent? \n\nIn terms of privacy, family members usually have a duty to respect each other's privacy unless there's a risk of harm. The author believed the sister's agency might be questionable, but that's their own judgment. Even if the sister's past is concerning, the decision to disclose it to someone else is a serious one. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt blindsided, which could be a valid response if he wasn't given a choice. \n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a consequence of the disclosure. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned, but bypassing the sister and going to the boyfriend directly without her approval could be seen as a breach of trust. It's possible the sister wanted to handle the information on her own terms. \n\nLegally and ethically, sharing personal details about someone without their consent can be problematic, especially if it's sensitive. Even if the author thought it was for a good reason, they might have overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. The parents' uncertainty about the boyfriend's knowledge doesn't necessarily justify the author's action. \n\nSo, considering the sister's right to privacy and the author's role in the family dynamic, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past.\n"
