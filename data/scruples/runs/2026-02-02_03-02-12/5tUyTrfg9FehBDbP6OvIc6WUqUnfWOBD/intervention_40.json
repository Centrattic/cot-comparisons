I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a controlling relationship where she claims she had little agency, and the author thinks it's wrong she's hiding this from her new boyfriend. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author went to tell him, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boundaries of family and privacy. The sister might have chosen to keep her past private, and the author stepping in could be seen as overstepping. But on the other hand, the author's concern is about the boyfriend knowing a significant part of the sister's history that could affect their relationship.\n\nThe sister's history of abuse is a sensitive issue. If the boyfriend wasn't aware, the author's intent was to protect the sister from potentially being in a harmful situation again, though the method was direct. However, the sister might feel her privacy was violated, leading to her cutting ties. The boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the author might have had good intentions.\n\nBut is it the author's place to disclose that information? Family dynamics can be complex. The author might have thought they were helping, but without the sister's consent, sharing such personal details could be seen as a breach of trust. The sister's right to control her narrative is important here.\n\nSo, balancing the intent to protect against overstepping boundaries. The author's actions, while well-meaning, might have been inappropriate because they didn't consult the sister first. The result was damaging the relationship with both the sister and the boyfriend. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and autonomy in deciding what to share with her partner.\n"
