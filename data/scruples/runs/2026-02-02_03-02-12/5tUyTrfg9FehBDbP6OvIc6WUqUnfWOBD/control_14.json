I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had been in a relationship where she was abused and maybe even pimped out. The author thought it was wrong that the boyfriend didn't know about this, so they told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister then cut off the author. Now the author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's right to privacy. The sister might have chosen not to share her past with her boyfriend for various reasons. Maybe she wasn't ready, or maybe she felt it was her own story to tell. By the author stepping in and revealing this information without the sister's consent, they might have violated her privacy. That could be a point against the author.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's parents being unsure if the boyfriend knew. The author assumed it was wrong for the boyfriend not to know, but maybe the sister had reasons for not telling him. The author's intent was to protect the sister's future partner, which is understandable, but the method of doing so without her permission is questionable. \n\nAlso, the author's judgment of their sister's agency in the past situation might be clouding their judgment. If the sister feels that she had some agency, the author's assumption could be incorrect. This might lead to an overstepping of boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they were acting in their sister's best interest by ensuring the boyfriend was fully informed about her background. However, the right to share someone else's personal information, especially something as sensitive as abuse, usually belongs to the person involved. The author didn't check with the sister first, which could have led to the fallout.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the author's action of revealing the information without consent might have been the trigger. Even if the intention was good, the method could be seen as inappropriate. The sister's response to cut off the author might be her way of protecting her relationship, but it's also a valid reaction to her privacy being violated.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's privacy and autonomy, even if their intentions were to help. The key issue is the lack of consent from the sister before sharing such personal information.\n"
