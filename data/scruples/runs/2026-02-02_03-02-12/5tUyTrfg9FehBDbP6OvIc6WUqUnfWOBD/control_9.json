I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past.\n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she claims her ex was a pimp. The author feels she might not be taking full responsibility for her role in that situation. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of this history. The author decided to tell the boyfriend, thinking it was important because most people would be concerned about marrying someone with such a history. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author. \n\nNow, considering the situation, there's a conflict here. On one hand, the author's intention was to protect their sister's future partner by informing him of something significant. On the other hand, the author didn't consult the sister first, which could be seen as a breach of her privacy. The sister might have chosen not to share that information with her boyfriend for her own reasons, maybe to protect herself or because she felt it was in the past. The author's action could have been a violation of trust, especially if the sister didn't want that history disclosed. \n\nHowever, the author's concern about the sister's agency in the abusive situation adds another layer. If the author believed the sister was in denial or downplaying her role, maybe they felt compelled to act. But even so, the right approach might have been to talk to the sister first rather than the boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he wasn't prepared for this information, which complicates things. \n\nThe key points are privacy, consent to share personal information, and the potential harm caused by revealing sensitive details without permission. Even if the author's motives were good, sharing such personal information without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping. The sister's decision to cut off the author is a consequence of that breach. \n\nSo, while the author might have had intentions to help, the method was flawed. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy to share her own history. However, there's also a case to be made that the author was trying to protect the boyfriend from being misled. But typically, privacy and consent are strong factors here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
