I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The situation is complicated. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped, and the author felt she was hiding this from her current boyfriend. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, and now the sister is cutting the author off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention was to protect their sister's future partner from being misled. But maybe they overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. The sister might have wanted to disclose her history on her own terms. The author's parents were also unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the author assumed the worst. \n\nHowever, the sister might need support to address her past, and the author's approach might have been too direct. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to the shock of the information, but that doesn't justify his anger. The sister's response to the author is extreme, possibly because she feels her autonomy was violated.\n\nI think the key points are: Did the author have the right to disclose private information without consent? The sister's history is sensitive, and sharing it without her knowledge could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even with good intentions, it's about privacy and trust. The author might have thought they were helping, but they didn't consider the sister's agency in revealing her past. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed personal information without the sister's consent, even if they thought it was for her benefit. The sister has the right to control what information she shares about her past.\n"
