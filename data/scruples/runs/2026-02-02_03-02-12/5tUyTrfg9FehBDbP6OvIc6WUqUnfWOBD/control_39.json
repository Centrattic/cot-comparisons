I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves the writer telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past without the sister's permission. \n\nFirst, I need to consider confidentiality and trust. The sister had a history of being abused, and the writer shared that information with her boyfriend. Even if the writer thought it was for the best, sharing someone's personal and traumatic history without their consent is a big deal. That could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the sister might have her reasons for not disclosing it to her boyfriend.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the sister's agency. The writer isn't sure if the sister had as little control as she claims. But that's the sister's story to tell, and the writer's assumption might not be valid. It's possible the sister is healing and has chosen to move forward without bringing the past into her new relationship. The writer's judgment about her choices could be projecting their own views on what's appropriate.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also a factor. They were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which made the writer decide to tell him. But was the writer the right person to make that decision? The parents might have wanted to handle it, or maybe they weren't sure. The writer took it upon themselves, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nWhen the boyfriend reacted negatively, the writer then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, which led to the sister cutting them off. The boyfriend's reaction was emotional, but the root issue is the breach of confidentiality. The writer's actions led to conflict, so the sister's anger is understandable. The writer might have prioritized their own belief about honesty over respecting the sister's autonomy in sharing her story.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the writer likely overstepped by sharing private information without consent. Even if the intention was to protect the sister or the boyfriend, the means were problematic. The sister's right to control her narrative is important here. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
