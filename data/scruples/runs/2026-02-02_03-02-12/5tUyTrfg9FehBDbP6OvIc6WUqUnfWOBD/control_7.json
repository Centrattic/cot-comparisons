I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about their sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated really badly, even to the point of being a pimp. The author thought it was wrong that the boyfriend didn't know this, and so they went to tell him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelled, and threw the author out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect their sister's boyfriend by informing him about her past. But was that their right to do? The sister might have chosen not to disclose that information, maybe for valid reasons. The author might have overstepped by not respecting the sister's privacy and her choice to keep that part of her life private. Even if the author was concerned about the boyfriend's knowledge, they could have talked to the sister first instead of going straight to the boyfriend. By doing so, the author bypassed the sister's autonomy, which is a big issue. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of potential harm. Even if the author thought the boyfriend should know, sharing such sensitive information without consent could have caused unnecessary distress. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to shock, anger, or feeling betrayed by the sister, but the author might not be in the best position to judge how he should handle it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern might stem from a place of wanting to protect both their sister and the boyfriend. They might believe that the boyfriend is being kept in the dark about something major that could affect their relationship. However, the method of disclosure is crucial here. Without the sister's permission, the author's action could be seen as invasive and disrespectful. \n\nAdditionally, the sister's response was cutting off the author. That's a strong reaction, but maybe it's because she felt her privacy was violated. If the sister had chosen to disclose her past, the boyfriend might have reacted differently. The author's direct approach might have forced the issue, causing conflict without giving the sister a chance to handle it on her own terms.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the key factors are consent, privacy, and respecting boundaries. The author acted without the sister's consent, which is a significant ethical breach. Even with good intentions, the action could be considered wrong because it disregarded the sister's autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be a result of the information being presented in a confrontational way and without the sister's input.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend, the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's privacy and decision-making authority over her own relationships.\n"
