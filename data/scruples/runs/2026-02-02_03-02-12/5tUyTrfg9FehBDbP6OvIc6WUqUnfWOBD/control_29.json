I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about whether the person who told their sister's boyfriend about her past is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the sister had a bad experience with an ex who was abusive and a pimp. The author is concerned about the current boyfriend not knowing this, thinking it's important he knows. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. So the author decides to tell him directly.\n\nNow, the question is if the author was wrong. The main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Confidentiality and Consent**: Did the sister give permission for her personal history to be shared? The author didn't consult her, just went to the boyfriend directly. That might be a breach of trust between siblings.\n\n2. **Intentions**: The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from a potentially bad situation. They believed the boyfriend should know the truth to make an informed decision. However, the sister might have reasons for not sharing her past, like fear of judgment or wanting to move on.\n\n3. **Consequences**: The boyfriend reacted negatively, which led to the sister cutting off the author. Even if the author thought they were right, the method might have been unwise. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk to the sister first and let her decide whether to tell the boyfriend herself.\n\n4. **Boundaries**: Siblings can have different boundaries. The sister might value her privacy and autonomy, especially regarding her relationships. The author overstepped by not discussing it with her first.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: The sister's response was extreme, but it's possible she felt betrayed. The author might not consider the emotional toll of exposing such a sensitive issue without consent.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was good, acting without the sister's consent could be seen as the wrong approach. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to share that information without the sister's approval. In most cases, sharing someone else's personal and traumatic history without their permission is a violation of their privacy and trust, regardless of the reasons. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
