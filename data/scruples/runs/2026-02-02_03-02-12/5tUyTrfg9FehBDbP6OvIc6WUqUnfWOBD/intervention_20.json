I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the wrong thing here. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous boyfriend, and the author thinks it's wrong that the current boyfriend didn't know. The author told him, and it caused a big conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's rights to privacy. The sister might not have shared her past with her boyfriend, so the author stepping in and revealing that without her consent could be a problem. But on the other hand, if the sister is in a serious relationship and hiding something that could affect the relationship, maybe the author had a good reason to speak up for her safety.\n\nThen there's the aspect of family dynamics. The author's parents were also unsure if the boyfriend knew the sister's history. The author might have felt that the boyfriend deserved to know to make an informed decision. But was it the author's place to do that? Maybe the sister should have been the one to disclose that information herself.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, which might indicate that he wasn't expecting it and took it out on the author. The author then asked the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, but the sister cut off the author. This could mean the sister felt her privacy was violated, and she's upset with the author for not respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The author shared personal information without the sister's consent. 2) The information could affect the boyfriend's decision in the relationship. 3) The sister might have felt her privacy was invaded, leading to the fallout.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting someone's well-being and respecting their privacy. The author's intention might have been to protect their sister from a potentially harmful relationship if the boyfriend wasn't aware of the history. However, the method of sharing the information without consent might have been inappropriate. The sister might have wanted to control how and when her past was revealed.\n\nAlso, the sister's history with abuse is a sensitive issue. The author's assumption that the agency of the sister in her past might be in question could be problematic. Maybe the sister has a reason not to disclose it, or she's not ready to share it. The author's judgment about how little agency she had might not be fair, and that could be a point of conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might stem from a place of concern, the act of disclosing private information without consent likely crossed a boundary. The sister has a right to privacy, and the author overstepped by revealing it without her approval. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
