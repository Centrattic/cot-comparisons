I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. The sister had a history where her ex-boyfriend was abusive and controlled her, which she didn't tell the current boyfriend. The author believes the sister might be hiding the truth about her agency in that situation. \n\nFirst, the author's motivation: they thought it was wrong for the sister to be with someone without revealing such a major part of her history. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nNow, considering confidentiality and boundaries. Typically, people have the right to keep their personal information private, especially their relationships. The author might have thought they were protecting the boyfriend from being hurt if he was unaware, but that's a big assumption. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing, maybe she's not ready, or maybe she's trying to move forward. The author's action could be seen as a breach of trust, even if well-intentioned.\n\nHowever, the sister's past is significant, and the boyfriend has a right to know if his partner has such a history, especially if it affects their relationship. But the author didn't know if the sister was being truthful about her agency in the abuse situation. That's a tricky part. The author's judgment about the sister's honesty might influence their decision to intervene.\n\nBut the key issue here is whether the author overstepped by sharing private information without the sister's consent. Even if the intention was to help, the method might be problematic. Relationships are personal, and family members shouldn't necessarily meddle unless there's a clear risk of harm. If the author believed the sister was in danger or that the boyfriend was being misled in a harmful way, maybe there's a case for their action. But if it's more about the author's own discomfort with the sister's situation, that's different.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction suggests he might have felt betrayed or violated by the information. The sister cutting off the author is a consequence of the breach of trust. The author might have valid concerns, but their approach could be seen as wrong because they didn't respect the sister's privacy and autonomy to share her story on her own terms.\n\nSo, balancing the right to privacy against the potential harm of withholding information. In this case, the author might have acted out of concern but without the sister's consent, leading to harm in their relationship. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong for invading their sister's privacy, even with good intentions.\n"
