I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse by her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was a pimp. She's now dating someone new, and the author thinks it's wrong that the boyfriend doesn't know this history. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, leading to a fallout with the sister.\n\nSo, the main question is whether revealing this information was the right thing to do. The author's reasoning is that the boyfriend should know about the sister's past because it's a major issue that might affect their relationship. They argue that the sister was hiding this, so the author took it upon themselves to disclose it. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel that her privacy was violated. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but maybe he wasn't ready to hear that. There's also the question of whether the author had the right to act as a gatekeeper of sensitive information. \n\nI should consider the intent here. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being unaware of a serious issue. However, sharing such personal and sensitive information without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping. It's possible that the sister wanted to manage how and when to tell her boyfriend, and by the author intervening, they usurped her agency. \n\nAlso, the author's doubt about the sister's account of her past could be a factor. If the author isn't sure about the sister's agency in the abusive situation, maybe they should have addressed that with the sister first instead of the boyfriend. \n\nAnother angle is the sister's reaction. She cut off the author after the boyfriend was upset. That might indicate she felt betrayed. The author might have acted out of concern but without considering the sister's autonomy and the potential consequences of revealing such information without her consent.\n\nSo, while the author's intention might have been to help, the method of disclosure could be problematic. The right to privacy and consent are important here. The author might not be in the wrong if their intention was good, but they could still be wrong for not respecting the sister's wishes and boundaries. \n\nIn many cases, disclosing someone's private information without their permission can be considered a breach of trust, even if the intent is to help. The boyfriend's reaction was negative, but the sister's estrangement from the author is a consequence of this action. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author had the right to share that information. Since the sister was the one in the relationship, she might have been the one to decide when and how to disclose her past. By the author stepping in, they might have violated the sister's autonomy, making them at least partially at fault. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared sensitive information without consent, even if the intention was to protect the boyfriend.\n"
