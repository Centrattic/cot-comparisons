I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, and the author thought it was important for the boyfriend to know. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend was aware, and the author decided to tell him, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's safety and well-being are crucial. If the boyfriend was unaware of the abuse, sharing that information could help him make an informed decision about the relationship. However, the author approached the boyfriend directly without consulting the sister first, which might have been a misstep. The sister might have wanted to disclose this herself in her own time and way. By bypassing her, the author could have breached her trust, especially if she wasn't ready to share that information with him yet.\n\nBut then, the boyfriend reacted negatively, which is concerning. If the boyfriend was already abusive or manipulative, the sister might be in danger. However, the boyfriend's reaction of yelling and throwing the author out could be a red flag. The author's intention was to protect their sister, which is understandable, but the method of disclosure might have been inappropriate. \n\nThe sister's response cutting off the author is also a factor. The author wanted a heartfelt apology from the boyfriend, but the sister didn't want to engage. This shows that the sister values her relationship with the boyfriend over her sister's concerns, at least for now. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions stem from a place of concern for their sister's well-being. However, without the sister's consent, sharing personal traumatic experiences can be seen as a violation of privacy. The ethical dilemma here is between protecting a loved one and respecting their autonomy in how they handle their own relationships and past.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because their motives were protective, but the approach could have been better. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the sister chose to end contact, maybe there's a conflict between the author's good intentions and the sister's autonomy. Different people might have different views here, but I think the author's intent was right, even if the execution could be questioned. But in terms of wrongdoing, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. If the sister's privacy was invaded, then the author is wrong. If it's seen as a necessary action for her safety, then not. Given the information, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuanced aspect here.\n"
