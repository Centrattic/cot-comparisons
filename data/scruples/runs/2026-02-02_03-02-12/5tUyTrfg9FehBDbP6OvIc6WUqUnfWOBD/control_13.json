I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author's sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was like a pimp. Now, she's dating someone new, and the author told the new boyfriend about the sister's past. The parents didn't know if the new guy knew, so the author went to him and revealed the history. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, the sister's situation: she was in an abusive relationship. The author is concerned about the new boyfriend not knowing about her past. The author thinks it's wrong for the sister to not disclose such a major detail. The author's intention was to tell the truth, but maybe without the sister's consent. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author had the right to share her sister's private information. Even if the author's intentions were good, did they overstep by disclosing something so personal without the sister's permission? The sister might have her reasons for not telling the new boyfriend, maybe she's not ready to talk about it, or she's trying to move on. The author's actions could have violated her privacy and trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is valid. If the new boyfriend didn't know about the abuse, it's a significant detail that could affect their relationship. The author might believe they were protecting the boyfriend from being blindsided later. But the way it was handled\u2014without the sister's knowledge or consent\u2014might have been the problem. The right approach could have been to talk to the sister first, express concerns, and let her decide what to do. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was defensive and angry, which the author might not have anticipated. The sister cutting the author off is a strong response, but maybe the author's breach of confidentiality was the main issue. In most cases, sharing someone else's private information without their consent is considered wrong, even if the motive is good. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's privacy. However, there's a moral dilemma here about whether the truth should be revealed for the sake of the new relationship. But legally and socially, without consent, it's a breach of privacy. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
