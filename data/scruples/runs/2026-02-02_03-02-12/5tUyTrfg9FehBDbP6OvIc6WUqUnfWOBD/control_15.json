I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. So, the sister had a history of being in an abusive situation where her ex was acting like a pimp. The author overheard her talking to the parents and then took it upon themselves to tell the boyfriend about this. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The sister might have kept her past private for a reason. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which raises a red flag. By revealing that information to the boyfriend, the author is breaching the sister's privacy. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being hurt, it's not their place to disclose someone else's private information without consent.\n\nThen, the boyfriend's reaction was to yell and throw the author out. The author then demands an apology from the boyfriend, which leads the sister to cut off the author. The key issue here is the violation of privacy. The author's actions were well-intentioned but crossed a boundary by not consulting the sister first. \n\nAlso, the author's judgment about their sister's agency in the abusive situation might be influenced by their own perspective. Even if they don't fully believe the sister's account, it's not their role to question her experiences publicly. The sister might have reasons for not sharing her past yet, such as trauma or fear of judgment. \n\nSo, considering all points, the author's mistake was not respecting their sister's privacy and making a decision to disclose sensitive information without her permission. That's a breach of trust, which is likely why the sister reacted so strongly. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
