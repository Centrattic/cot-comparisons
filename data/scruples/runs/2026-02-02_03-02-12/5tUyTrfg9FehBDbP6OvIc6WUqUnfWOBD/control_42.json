I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling her sister's boyfriend about the sister's past. The key points here are the sister's history of abuse, the author's concern about the boyfriend not knowing, and the fallout after the author revealed the truth.\n\nFirst, the sister had been in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. The author thinks the boyfriend might not know this and decides to tell him, leading to a conflict. The parents also mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. So the author's intention was to protect her sister by ensuring the boyfriend had all the information, even if the sister didn't disclose it herself.\n\nBut wait, the sister might have chosen not to share her history for her own reasons. Maybe she's healing and doesn't want that part of her past to affect her current relationship. The author's action could be seen as overstepping, even if it's coming from a place of concern. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, but does that mean the author is wrong? Or is the issue about respecting the sister's privacy?\n\nThe sister cut off the author, which complicates things. The author's main argument is that the boyfriend should know important information that could affect their future together. However, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a violation of trust. The sister might have wanted to handle this on her own terms.\n\nOn the other hand, if the sister hadn't told the boyfriend, and he was about to be blindsided, the author might feel she had a duty to intervene. But the line between helping and interfering is thin here. The author's approach was direct and led to immediate conflict, which raises questions about the method used.\n\nI think the answer hinges on consent and privacy. The author didn't consult the sister first, which might have been better. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past is important. Even with good intentions, the author acted without permission, leading to the breakdown in relationships. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries.\n"
