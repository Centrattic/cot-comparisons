I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was basically her pimp, and she's been with this new guy for over a year, possibly talking marriage. The author felt the sister wasn't sharing this important info with the new boyfriend. They told the boyfriend, and he reacted badly, leading to a fallout.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is consent. Did the sister give permission for her private information to be shared? If not, then maybe the author overstepped. Even if the author thought it was important for the boyfriend to know, sharing someone else's personal trauma without their consent could be seen as violating their privacy.\n\nThen there's the intent. The author's motivation was to protect the sister's new partner from being in a relationship with someone who had a traumatic past. But the sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, especially if she didn't want that part of her history known yet. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but intentions don't always justify the action if it's done without consent.\n\nAlso, the reaction of the boyfriend was hostile. The author might not have considered how the boyfriend would react or if he already knew. Maybe the sister had told him already, and the author's disclosure was redundant and hurtful. Or maybe the boyfriend was indeed shocked, but his reaction was inappropriate. The author's approach of confronting the boyfriend directly might not have been the best method. Perhaps they should have talked to the sister first, even if it was uncomfortable, to get her perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's agency. The author isn't sure if the sister had little agency in her past abuse. That uncertainty might mean they shouldn't assume they know her situation better than she does. The sister might be handling her recovery and new relationship in her own way, and the author's intervention could be seen as undermining her autonomy.\n\nThe fallout is significant: the sister cut off the author. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend might have been too much, especially if the boyfriend felt wronged by the disclosure. The sister's anger could be because her privacy was breached, and she feels her boundaries were disrespected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But generally, sharing someone else's personal information without their consent is a breach of trust, even if the intention is good. The author might have acted out of concern but without considering the sister's wishes or the potential consequences. So, while the situation is complex, the act of disclosing the sister's past without permission is likely where the author went wrong.\n"
