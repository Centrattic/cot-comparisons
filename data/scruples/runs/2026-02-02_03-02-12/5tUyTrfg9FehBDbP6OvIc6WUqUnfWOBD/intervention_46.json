I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's past. The sister had a history of being abused and pimped by an ex, and the author thought it was wrong to hide this from the current boyfriend. So the author went to the boyfriend directly and told him, leading to a bad reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister didn't disclose her history, so the author felt compelled to step in. But is it the author's place to do so? Family dynamics can be complex. The author might believe they were protecting their sister's future partner from being misled. However, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be a breach of trust. The sister might feel betrayed by the author's actions, which could explain her cutting ties.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, which might indicate he wasn't prepared for that revelation. But does the author have the right to decide what information others should know about the sister? Even with good intentions, the author bypassed the sister's autonomy. There's a balance between protecting someone from harm and respecting another's right to privacy.\n\nLegal considerations? Probably not, but ethically, it's murky. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which adds complexity. If the sister had a duty to disclose her past, maybe the author thought they were helping. But the method was direct confrontation without the sister's consent, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent might be to help, the action of disclosing the sister's private information without her consent could be seen as wrong. The sister has the right to control her narrative and decide who to tell about her past. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
