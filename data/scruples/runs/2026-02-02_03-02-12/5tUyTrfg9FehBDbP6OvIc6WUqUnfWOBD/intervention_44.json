I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was treated as a pimp's girlfriend and then returned to live with her parents. The author made a comment to their parents about the boyfriend being good for her despite her history. The parents doubted whether the boyfriend knew about the abuse. The author decided to tell the boyfriend directly, which led to him yelling and throwing them out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by revealing the sister's past to the boyfriend. The author's reasoning was that it's wrong to hide such a significant issue from someone serious about the relationship. However, the sister might see this as an invasion of her privacy, as she chose not to disclose her past to the boyfriend.\n\nConsidering privacy and autonomy, the sister has the right to decide what information to share about her past. The author's intention might have been to protect both the sister and the boyfriend, but sharing personal information without consent can be problematic. Even if the author had good intentions, they bypassed the sister's choice to disclose, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's past is a major factor in a relationship, and the boyfriend might have a right to know if it affects their future together. But the author didn't consult the sister before revealing this, so it's about respecting boundaries versus protecting someone else's interests.\n\nLegally, there's no issue, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author might have thought they were helping, but the sister felt betrayed. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to being blindsided, and the sister's response shows how hurt she was by the author's actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had intentions to help, they didn't consider their sister's autonomy and privacy. It's a complex situation where the line between helping and overstepping is thin. The author likely is in the wrong for not respecting their sister's choice to share her past on her own terms.\n"
