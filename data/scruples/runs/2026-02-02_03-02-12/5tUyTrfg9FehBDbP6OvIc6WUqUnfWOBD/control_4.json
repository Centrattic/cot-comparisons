I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was in an abusive situation where her ex was basically her pimp, which is really serious. The author believes their sister's account might not be entirely accurate, but they still feel she's hiding this history from her current boyfriend. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, and the author decided to tell him directly.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author overstepped by revealing this private information. The sister's past is sensitive, and even if the author had good intentions, sharing it without the sister's consent could be a breach of privacy. The boyfriend's reaction was to yell and throw the author out, which is a strong response, but maybe he felt blindsided or hurt. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, leading the sister to cut off the author.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between protecting a loved one and respecting their privacy. The author might have thought they were helping their sister by making sure the boyfriend knew the truth, but without her permission, they violated her confidentiality. On the other hand, the sister wasn't being transparent about her past, which could affect the relationship's future. However, the decision to share such personal information isn't up to the author unless there's imminent harm, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nThe author's actions caused a rift in the family. Even if their intentions were good, the method was problematic. The sister might have wanted to disclose it on her own terms, and the author's intervention ruined that. The boyfriend's harsh reaction might be due to feeling disrespected or untrusting, but the author's approach was definitely intrusive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely overstepped by sharing private information without consent, leading to negative consequences. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
