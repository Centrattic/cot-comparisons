I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person who wrote the post (AITA) told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which they felt was a major issue. The sister had been in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimped person, and she's now with this guy for over a year, planning marriage. The author believed the boyfriend didn't know about this history, so they told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. The author's reasoning was that the boyfriend should know about the sister's past to make an informed decision. However, they didn't go through the sister first. The sister had kept this a secret, and the author shared it without her consent. \n\nOn one hand, the author might think they were protecting their sister by ensuring the boyfriend was aware of her history. On the other hand, the sister might feel her privacy was violated. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he was taken aback, but the author didn't consider that the sister might have valid reasons for not disclosing it yet, like fear of rejection or not wanting to burden him. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since they didn't discuss it with the sister first. Even if the author had good intentions, bypassing the sister's autonomy in sharing her own story might be problematic. The sister has the right to her privacy and to decide when and how to share her past. The author's intervention might have caused more harm by breaking trust between them and the sister.\n\nSo, while the intention might have been to help, the method was flawed. The correct answer would be that the author is in the wrong. They should have approached their sister first, discussed their concerns, and perhaps encouraged her to tell the boyfriend herself if it was necessary. Sharing someone's private information without their consent, even with good intentions, is generally considered a breach of trust.\n"
