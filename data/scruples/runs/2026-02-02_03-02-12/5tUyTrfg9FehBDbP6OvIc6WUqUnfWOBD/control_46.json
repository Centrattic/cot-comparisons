I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's ex-boyfriend was abusive and controlled her, which is a serious issue. The author's parents weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew about this history. The author decided to inform him, leading to a conflict where the boyfriend reacted angrily and the sister cut off the author.\n\nIs the author's action justified? Well, the sister had a traumatic past that the boyfriend might not have known about, which could affect their relationship. The author's intention was to protect their sister by ensuring the boyfriend was aware, which could be seen as caring. However, sharing such personal information without the sister's consent is a breach of privacy. \n\nThe sister might feel that the author overstepped by revealing her history without her permission. Even if the author had good intentions, the method of disclosure was unauthorized. The boyfriend's reaction, though harsh, might be a result of being blindsided by such sensitive information. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the boyfriend deserved to know, given the seriousness of the abuse. But in terms of ethics and respecting personal boundaries, the author didn't have the right to disclose this information without consent. The sister's agency and autonomy in deciding who knows her history is important. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not seeking the sister's permission first. Even with good intentions, sharing such personal details without consent can be considered a violation of privacy. The sister's reaction, cutting off the author, is extreme but possibly a result of feeling betrayed. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for breaching their sister's privacy, even if the motive was protective. The answer would be A.\n"
