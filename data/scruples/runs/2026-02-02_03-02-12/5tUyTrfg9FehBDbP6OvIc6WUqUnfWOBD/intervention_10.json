I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister had been in an abusive relationship and was controlled by her previous boyfriend, even being described as a pimp. The author made a comment to the parents about the current boyfriend being good for her, considering her history. The parents then expressed doubt about whether the boyfriend knew about the abuse. \n\nThe author's concern is valid because they believe that a major part of the sister's history is relevant for the boyfriend to know, especially if they're serious about marriage. The author took it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend directly because they felt the sister was hiding this important information. However, the boyfriend reacted negatively, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut ties with the author, asking them to leave her life.\n\nNow, the key points here are: 1) Did the author have the right to disclose this information? 2) Was the sister's approach to concealing her past a valid reason for the author to act this way? 3) How does the boyfriend's reaction factor into the equation?\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they might be seen as trying to protect their sister from potentially harmful relationships. The sister had been in a situation where she had little agency, which is a serious matter. The author's intention was to ensure the boyfriend was aware of the sister's history so he could make an informed decision. However, the method of disclosure\u2014telling the boyfriend directly without the sister's consent\u2014could be problematic. \n\nThe sister's disclosure to the boyfriend isn't mentioned, but the author is concerned about the lack of transparency. The author might have thought that the boyfriend needed to know to decide whether to continue the relationship. On the flip side, the sister might have felt that sharing her past was her prerogative and that the author overstepped by revealing it without her permission.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author had good intentions but acted without considering the sister's autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author could be at fault for not discussing this with the sister first. The sister's right to privacy and her choice to control her narrative about her past is important. Even if the author thought the boyfriend should know, bypassing the sister's consent might have been the wrong approach. \n\nSo, while the author's concern is understandable, the action taken might be seen as overstepping boundaries. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed sensitive information without the sister's permission, even if their intentions were good.\n"
