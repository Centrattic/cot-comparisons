I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp. The author was concerned that the new boyfriend didn't know this and thought it was important he did. The sister's boyfriend reacted angrily, and now the sister is cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's past is significant, especially since it's related to abuse. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend so he could make an informed decision. However, the author didn't go through the sister, who claimed to be in a serious relationship. So, the key points are: 1) The author shared confidential information without consent. 2) The information could impact the relationship. 3) The sister's agency in her past situation is in question.\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they were protecting the boyfriend from being in a situation he wasn't aware of. On the other hand, the sister might feel her privacy was violated. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he might have been blindsided, but that doesn't justify his yelling. However, the author's action without the sister's permission could be seen as overstepping. The sister's response is extreme, but the author's action might have breached trust. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, sharing someone else's private information without their consent is generally considered wrong. Even with good intentions, it's about respecting boundaries. The sister had the right to disclose her own past if she chose to. The author's action, while well-meaning, crossed a line by not respecting her autonomy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
