I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out. She's now in a serious relationship with this guy, and the author thinks it's wrong that she hasn't told him. The author decides to disclose this information to the boyfriend, which leads to the boyfriend yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cuts off the author.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intent was to protect their sister from a potentially bad relationship by making the boyfriend aware of her past. But was that within the author's right? The sister didn't tell the boyfriend, so maybe she wanted to keep it private. The author's action could be seen as a violation of trust if the sister didn't share it. However, the author might argue that the sister's well-being is a priority, and the boyfriend has a right to know something so significant.\n\nBut the problem is, the author took it upon themselves to share without the sister's consent. Even if the intent was good, the method might be wrong. The boyfriend's reaction suggests it was a sensitive topic, and the sister is now upset with the author. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend might not be fair, as the boyfriend was being yelled at for something he might not have known, or maybe he was already aware and was just defensive.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's a boundary between family matters and personal privacy. The sister's past is her story to tell. By revealing it without her permission, the author could have breached confidentiality. Even if the sister's current partner should know, it's typically her responsibility to disclose such information. The author's interference might have caused more harm, leading to the sister cutting off communication.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they overstepped by sharing personal information without consent, even if their intentions were protective. The sister has the right to control her own narrative, and the author's actions disrupted that, leading to negative consequences.\n"
