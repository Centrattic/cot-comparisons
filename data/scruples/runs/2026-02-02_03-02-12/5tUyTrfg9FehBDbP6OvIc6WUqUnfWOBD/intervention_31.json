I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had a history where her ex-boyfriend abused her and acted like a pimp. The author told the boyfriend about this because they thought it was important for him to know, given how serious their relationship is. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author's intention was to protect their sister from potentially being in another abusive situation. They believed the boyfriend should know the truth to make an informed decision. But the way they went about it\u2014telling the boyfriend directly without the sister's consent\u2014might be problematic. \n\nConsent is a big factor. The sister might have wanted to disclose that information on her own terms. By revealing it without her permission, the author might have violated her trust. Even if the author felt it was for her own good, the sister's autonomy in sharing her history is important. \n\nOn the other hand, the sister was in a serious relationship, and significant past trauma like abuse could impact the current relationship. The boyfriend might have had a right to know, especially if it could affect their future together. However, the author's approach could have been more respectful. Maybe they should have discussed it with the sister first, encouraging her to share the information herself, rather than disclosing it directly to the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might indicate that he was unprepared for the news or felt betrayed. But the author's action was based on concern, even if the method was questionable. \n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but it might stem from feeling her privacy was invaded. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to disclose personal information about a family member without their consent, even if the intent was protective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were good, but the action taken might have overstepped by not respecting the sister's autonomy. So, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't get the sister's consent before sharing her personal history.\n"
