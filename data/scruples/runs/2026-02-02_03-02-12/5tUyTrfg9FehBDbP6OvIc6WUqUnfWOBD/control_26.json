I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister who had a past abusive relationship, and her current boyfriend wasn't told about it. The author decided to tell the boyfriend the truth, but the boyfriend reacted really negatively, leading to the sister cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's past is serious\u2014being a victim of abuse and pimping. The author is concerned about the boyfriend not knowing this. But was it the author's place to disclose this information? Usually, people have a right to privacy, especially regarding past traumatic experiences. Even if the sister might be hiding the truth or minimizing her role, the author might have overstepped by not discussing it with her first.\n\nThe parents were in on the secret, not knowing if the boyfriend was aware. The author's intention was to protect their sister, but did they handle it the right way? Maybe they should have talked to the sister first to understand her perspective and see if she was ready to disclose the information. By going straight to the boyfriend, the author might have violated the sister's trust, which is a big deal in family relationships.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme\u2014yelling and throwing the author out. That could be because he was surprised, or maybe because he was already aware and felt betrayed. Either way, the author's action caused a rift in their family. The sister then cut off the author, which shows how hurt she was by the betrayal.\n\nSo, the key points are: privacy, consent to share information, and the impact on family relationships. Even if the author had good intentions, disclosing personal trauma without discussing it first with the person it's about could be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's autonomy and privacy, even if the concern was valid.\n"
