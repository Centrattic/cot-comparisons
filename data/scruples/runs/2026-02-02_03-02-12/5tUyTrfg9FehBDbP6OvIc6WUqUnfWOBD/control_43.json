I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which led to a conflict with the boyfriend and the sister cutting the author off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was essentially her pimp. The author's parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of this history. The author believed it was wrong for the sister to be with someone without disclosing such a major part of her past. So the author decided to tell the boyfriend directly, which resulted in being yelled at and thrown out. Then, the author asked the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, which led to the sister ending the relationship with the author.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's intention was to protect their sister's future partner by informing him about her past. But the sister might see this as an invasion of her privacy. The author might think they're doing the right thing by ensuring transparency, but the sister might believe that her privacy was violated, especially if she didn't consent to sharing that information.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here since it's about personal relationships. But morally, it's a gray area. The author acted out of concern, but the sister might feel her autonomy was breached. The boyfriend's reaction (yelling, throwing the author out) suggests he was hurt or upset, possibly because the sister didn't tell him, or he was defensive.\n\nThe sister cutting off the author could be a reaction to feeling betrayed by her sibling. The author might not have considered that the sister had a right to decide who she shares her past with. Even if the author thought the boyfriend should know, the sister's agency in her own relationships is important. The author's action could be seen as overstepping, assuming they knew what was best for the sister's relationships.\n\nBut on the other hand, the sister's past is a significant red flag. If the boyfriend wasn't aware, the author might think it's irresponsible to keep it hidden. However, family members aren't usually responsible for disclosing such information unless they have a legal duty, which they don't here.\n\nSo the question is whether the author overstepped by sharing the sister's private information without her consent. The answer would depend on whether the author had the right to disclose that information. Since it's personal and sensitive, the author likely didn't have the sister's permission, which could make them at fault for breaching her privacy. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were good.\n"
