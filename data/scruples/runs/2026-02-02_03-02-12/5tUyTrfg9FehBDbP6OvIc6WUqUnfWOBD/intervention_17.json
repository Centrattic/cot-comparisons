I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse, which the sister had concealed. The sister's boyfriend reacted badly, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. They thought it was wrong that the sister was hiding such a major issue from her partner. The author believed that the boyfriend should know about the abuse because it's a significant part of her history that could affect their relationship. The parents also seemed unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him. \n\nBut wait, is the author the right person to disclose that information? The sister might have chosen not to share her past for personal reasons, maybe she wasn't ready, or perhaps she felt it was her story to tell. The author stepping in without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping. Even with good intentions, sharing someone else's sensitive information without permission can be a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their sister's well-being. They might think that the boyfriend needs to know to make an informed decision about the relationship. But does that justify bypassing the sister's autonomy? It's a tricky balance between protecting a loved one and respecting their privacy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which could be due to being surprised or not knowing how to handle the information. However, the author's approach might have been confrontational or not properly explained, leading to the conflict. The sister cutting off the author is a strong response, but maybe she felt betrayed that her past was shared without her consent.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to protect their sister, but the method might have been inappropriate. Trust issues can arise when family members share personal information without consent. Even if the author thought it was for the best, they might have violated the sister's privacy. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's boundaries, even if their motives were good. \n\nBut some might argue that the author was trying to help and that the boyfriend deserved to know. However, the key here is consent. Without the sister's permission, the author shouldn't have disclosed her history. That's a violation of her privacy. So, considering all angles, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they shared sensitive information without consent.\n"
