I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, the situation: The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was essentially her pimp. She now has a new boyfriend, and the author thinks it's wrong that the new boyfriend doesn't know this history. The author tells the boyfriend, who reacts angrily, and the sister cuts off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention was to share the truth because they believed the boyfriend should know about his girlfriend's past. The sister might not have told the new boyfriend about the abuse, which the author found concerning. The author's actions led to conflict, but was it right or wrong?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be problematic. Even with good intentions, the author might have violated their sister's privacy. The sister might have chosen not to disclose her past for personal reasons, maybe she's not ready or doesn't want to burden him. The author assumed that the boyfriend should know, but that's a judgment call. \n\nHowever, considering the severity of the abuse (being a pimp and abuse), some might argue that the boyfriend has a right to know such a significant part of his partner's history, especially if it affects their relationship. But the author bypassed the sister's choice to share it, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might suggest he wasn't prepared for that information, but the author's method of disclosure was direct and possibly confrontational. The sister's response cutting off the author adds to the tension.\n\nIn many cases, the ethical thing would be to discuss it with the sister first, not jump to sharing with the boyfriend. The author's action might have been well-meaning but still a breach of trust. So, while the intent was to do the right thing, the method was flawed. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's privacy and autonomy in deciding what to share about her past.\n"
