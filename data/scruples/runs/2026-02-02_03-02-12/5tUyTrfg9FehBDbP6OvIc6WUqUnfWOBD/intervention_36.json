I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote that AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about their sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp. The author mentioned this to their parents, who weren't sure if the boyfriend knew. Then the author told the boyfriend directly, which led to the boyfriend reacting angrily and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nThe key points here are: the sister is in a serious relationship, the author feels the sister is hiding her past, and the author intervenes by telling the boyfriend. The main question is whether this was the right thing to do.\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they're doing the right thing by protecting their sister from potentially getting hurt again, especially if they think the boyfriend isn't aware of her history. The author might see themselves as helping the boyfriend make an informed decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister might feel her privacy was violated. The author didn't consult her before sharing such personal information. The boyfriend's reaction could indicate that the information was sensitive and not something the author had the right to disclose without her consent.\n\nAlso, the sister's history with abuse is a serious matter. If the author has doubts about how much agency the sister had in that situation, it's possible they're projecting their own judgments onto her current relationship. The author's motivations might be clouded by their own beliefs about what the sister should do, rather than respecting her autonomy.\n\nEthically, people have a right to privacy, especially regarding personal and traumatic experiences. Unless there was an imminent risk of harm (like the sister being in danger), the author might have overstepped by disclosing this information without permission. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might stem from feeling blindsided and upset by the sudden revelation of such personal information.\n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but it's her response to feeling betrayed by a family member. The author's actions, even if well-intentioned, might have been seen as a breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a judgment call. But considering the principles of privacy and autonomy, the author likely did cross a boundary. They might not have considered the sister's right to decide what to share about her past. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
