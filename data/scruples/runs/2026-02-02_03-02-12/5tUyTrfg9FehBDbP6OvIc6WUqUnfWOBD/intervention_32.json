I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the boyfriend might not have known.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was basically her pimp. She's now dating someone new, and the author believes the new boyfriend isn't aware of her history. The author's parents also weren't sure if he knew. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to be in a serious relationship without revealing such a significant part of her past. So, the author went to the boyfriend's place and told him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The sister then cut off the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were trying to protect their sister's new partner from being unknowingly involved with someone who had a traumatic past. But the sister is upset because her boyfriend was treated poorly, and she's cutting off the author.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are confidentiality, consent, and the right to privacy. The sister's history is very personal, and sharing that information with the boyfriend without her consent could be a breach of trust. Even if the author thought it was for a good reason, they didn't ask the sister if she wanted that information shared. \n\nBy doing so, the author took responsibility for what they saw as the boyfriend's need to know, but that decision should ideally be up to the sister herself. The author's actions might have been well-intentioned, but they overstepped by not consulting the sister first. The boyfriend's reaction might have been extreme, but the author's method of sharing the information was a violation of the sister's privacy.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, even if the intention was good, the action of disclosing the sister's personal history without her permission is a breach of privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
