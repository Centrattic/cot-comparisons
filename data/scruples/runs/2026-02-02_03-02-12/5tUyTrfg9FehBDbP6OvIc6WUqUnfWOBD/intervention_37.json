I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The author's sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, and the author felt that the boyfriend should know about it since the couple was serious about marriage. The author approached the boyfriend directly, which led to a confrontation where the boyfriend reacted angrily and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister had a history of abuse, and the author was concerned about the boyfriend not knowing this. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend, believing it was necessary for him to make an informed decision. However, the sister might have wanted to keep this information private, and revealing it without her consent could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nIn many relationships, full disclosure of past experiences is important, especially significant ones like abuse. The author might argue that they were protecting the boyfriend by giving him information that could affect their future together. On the other hand, the sister might feel that her privacy was violated, and the author overstepped by sharing personal information without her permission.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to disclose someone else's information unless there's a duty of care or a specific legal requirement, which isn't mentioned here. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author acted out of concern but did so without the sister's consent, which could be seen as respecting the boyfriend's right to know versus respecting the sister's right to privacy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests that the author's approach might have been confrontational or uninvited, which could have contributed to the escalation. The sister's response\u2014cutting off the author\u2014indicates that the author's actions caused significant strain on their relationship.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's intent was protective, but the method might have been inappropriate. The key issue here is consent and the right to share someone else's personal information. Even with good intentions, sharing private details without consent can be harmful, especially if it's information that the person prefers to keep confidential.\n\nSo, while the author's motivation might be understandable, the action of disclosing the sister's history without her consent could be considered a breach of trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they acted without respecting their sister's autonomy and privacy, even if the intention was to help.\n"
