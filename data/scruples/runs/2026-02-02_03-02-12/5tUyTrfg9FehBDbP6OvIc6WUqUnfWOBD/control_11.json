I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who told their sister's boyfriend about the abuse is in the wrong. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where her ex was her pimp. The author thought it was wrong for her to hide this from her current boyfriend, so they told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's past is a sensitive issue. The author's intention was to protect their sister's future partner by being honest. However, the sister might have wanted to keep this private, possibly for her own reasons or because she felt it's not relevant. The author didn't consult her before sharing the information, which could have been a breach of privacy and trust.\n\nThen there's the method of disclosure. Telling the boyfriend without the sister's consent might be seen as overstepping boundaries. Even if the author's motive was good, the approach could have been more respectful. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the sister's response was cutting ties, which is significant.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's agency. The author is unsure if the sister had control in her past situation, which adds complexity. But the author's right to intervene is questionable. Families often have dynamics where one member feels responsible, but crossing into another person's relationship can be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might have valid concerns but handled it in a way that violated trust. The sister's right to privacy and control over her past is important. The boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but the author's action could have been approached differently, maybe by discussing with the sister first instead of going directly to her partner.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action was a breach of privacy and trust, even with good intentions. That would make them at least partially at fault. The answer would be A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
