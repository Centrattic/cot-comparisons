I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. The key points here are confidentiality, the sister's consent, and the potential impact of the disclosure.\n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner, who was also her pimp. The author overheard the parents saying they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew about this. The author, feeling that it's important for the boyfriend to know, went to the boyfriend and told him, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author had the right to disclose this information. Generally, personal information like that should be shared with the consent of the person involved. The sister might have chosen to keep this private, maybe for her own reasons or because the boyfriend already knew and she didn't want to rehash it. By revealing it without her consent, the author might have violated her privacy. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to protect their sister, thinking that the boyfriend should know about her past to make an informed decision. But even with good intentions, sharing someone else's sensitive information without their permission can be considered a breach of trust. The sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the author\u2014shows how hurt she was by the violation of her privacy.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, while aggressive, might stem from shock or feeling betrayed if he didn't know about the past. But the author's approach of confronting him directly without consulting the sister first was problematic. It's possible the sister had already discussed this with her boyfriend, or maybe she chose not to, and the author's disclosure disrupted that dynamic without her approval.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a principle that individuals have the right to control their personal information. The author didn't check with the sister if she wanted this information shared. Even if the author doubted the sister's account, that doesn't justify disclosing it without her consent. The sister might have valid reasons for not sharing her past, such as fear of judgment or wanting to move forward, and the author's actions undermined that.\n\nSo, while the author's concern for their sister's well-being is understandable, the method of disclosure was inappropriate. The author didn't respect the sister's autonomy in deciding how and when to share her past. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they acted without consent, leading to a breach of trust and damaging relationships.\n"
