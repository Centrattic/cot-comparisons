I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves them telling their sister's boyfriend about a past abusive relationship the sister had. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive situation where her ex was a pimp, and she's now in a serious relationship with someone new. The author believes that the new boyfriend should know about this history because it's major and might affect his decision to stay with her. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and boundaries. Did the author have the right to disclose this personal information without the sister's permission? The sister might have chosen to keep this information private, either due to shame, fear, or her own healing process. By revealing it, the author potentially violated her privacy and trust.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's agency. The author mentions they're unsure if the sister had little agency in her past situation. But that's their personal opinion, and it's not the sister's to dictate. The author's judgment about her past might not be fair, and inserting themselves into the relationship without considering the sister's wishes is problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative, which makes sense because the information is sensitive. The author then demands an apology from the boyfriend, leading the sister to cut ties with them. The author's actions caused a rift in the family, which is significant.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author had good intentions (trying to protect the boyfriend from a potentially harmful situation), they overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. The right to privacy and personal choice in relationships is crucial. Even if the author thought the boyfriend should know, the sister had the right to decide when, how, and if to share such information.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author acted without consent and possibly caused more harm than good. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
