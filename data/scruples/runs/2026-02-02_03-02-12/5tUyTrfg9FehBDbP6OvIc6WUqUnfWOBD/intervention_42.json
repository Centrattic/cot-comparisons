I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister's boyfriend being told about her past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister had a history of being abused by a previous partner. The author felt that the current boyfriend should know this because it's a major factor in the relationship. The author went to the boyfriend directly and shared this information. The boyfriend reacted angrily, leading to a fallout with the sister as well.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The sister might have kept the past a secret for her own reasons\u2014maybe she felt ready to share it at her own time, or perhaps there's more nuance in the situation. By the author sharing this information without the sister's consent, they potentially violated her privacy. However, the author's motivation was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had a traumatic past, possibly unaware of the risks.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have a valid concern about the boyfriend not knowing such a significant detail. But the method of sharing it directly without the sister's approval could be problematic. The sister's right to privacy versus the boyfriend's right to know is a tricky balance. The sister might feel that her autonomy was respected by not disclosing it herself, while the boyfriend might have a right to know about potential risks in the relationship.\n\nThe author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which suggests the sister might have been hiding it. The author's intention might have been to help, but without consent, it's a breach of trust. The sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but maybe it's because she felt her privacy was invaded. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was well-meaning but crossed a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the sister's response cutting off the author is extreme. However, the key issue is the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. So, while the author had intentions of \"doing the right thing,\" the method was flawed. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were good.\n"
