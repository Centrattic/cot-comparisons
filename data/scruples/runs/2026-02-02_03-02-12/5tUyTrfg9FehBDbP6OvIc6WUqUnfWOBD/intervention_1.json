I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's sister has been in a serious relationship for over a year, possibly discussing marriage. The sister's previous boyfriend was abusive and even behaved like a pimp. The author made a comment to their parents about the current boyfriend being good for her, considering her history. The parents then mentioned they weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew about this past. The author believed that the sister was hiding this important information and decided to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing the author out. The author then asked the sister for an apology from the boyfriend, but the sister cut off the author.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, let's consider the ethical aspects. The sister's past is significant\u2014she was in an abusive, controlling relationship. The author is concerned about the current boyfriend not knowing this, which could affect their relationship. The author's intention was to be honest and possibly protect the sister by ensuring transparency. However, the author did not consult the sister before sharing this information, which might have been a breach of her confidence.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's history is a serious matter. If the current boyfriend is unaware, it might affect his decision to marry her. The author's action was to inform him, which could be seen as trying to prevent future harm. But the way it was done\u2014without the sister's consent\u2014could be problematic. The sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, especially if she wanted to keep her past private. \n\nLegal aspects aside, the main issue is consent. The author didn't ask the sister if she wanted to disclose her past to her boyfriend. That's a key factor. The sister might have reasons for not sharing her history, maybe she's working on rebuilding her life without that past affecting her current relationship. By sharing without permission, the author overstepped, even if with good intentions.\n\nMoreover, the sister's reaction\u2014cutting off the author\u2014indicates the severity of the breach. The boyfriend's anger might have stemmed from surprise or feeling that his partner's confidence was violated. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of the intention (trying to do the right thing), but the action itself\u2014disclosing private information without consent\u2014could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the dilemma is between protecting someone by telling the truth and respecting someone's autonomy and privacy. The author's action was well-meaning but potentially a violation of trust. Therefore, while the intention was good, the action might be considered wrong because it disregarded the sister's right to decide what to share about her own past.\n"
