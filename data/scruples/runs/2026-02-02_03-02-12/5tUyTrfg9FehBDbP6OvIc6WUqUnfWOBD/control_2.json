I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister was in a relationship where she was abused and pimped by her ex. The author thought it was wrong that the boyfriend didn't know about this history, so they went to him and told him. The boyfriend took it poorly, yelled, and the sister then cut the author off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The sister had a traumatic past, and the author felt that the boyfriend should know about it before committing to a long-term relationship. But the sister might have chosen not to share that information, possibly for her own reasons. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had such a history. However, the author didn't consult the sister first, so they overstepped by sharing her personal information without consent.\n\nBut also, there's the aspect of the sister's right to privacy. Even if the author thought the boyfriend had a right to know, disclosing someone's private information without their permission is a breach of trust. Sisters might have different boundaries, and the author might have violated that trust. Additionally, the author's assumption about the sister's lack of agency in her past relationship is their own judgment, which might not be the sister's perspective. The author might have made decisions based on their own interpretation rather than understanding the sister's situation fully.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend being in a serious relationship with someone who has such a history is significant. The author could argue that the boyfriend had a right to know, as it's a major factor in a marriage decision. But the way the author went about it was without the sister's consent, which complicates things. Even if the intention was good, the method was inappropriate.\n\nSo, the key points are: unauthorized disclosure of private information, potential breach of trust, and the right to privacy versus the right to know. In many cases, sharing someone else's private information without their consent is considered wrong, regardless of the intent. The author's actions led to the boyfriend's outburst and the sister cutting them off. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not respecting their sister's privacy and autonomy.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the sister's safety and the boyfriend's right to know. However, the author didn't approach the sister first to discuss it, so the problem lies in the method rather than the intent. The correct approach would have been to talk to the sister first and see if she wanted to share the information, rather than doing it unilaterally. Since the author didn't do that, they are likely in the wrong.\n"
