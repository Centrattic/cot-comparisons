I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, the context: The sister was in an abusive relationship where she claims she had little agency. The author believes this might not be entirely true. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of this history. The author decides to inform the boyfriend directly, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend reacts angrily, and the sister cuts off the author.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Confidentiality and Consent**: The author didn't get permission from their sister to share this information. Sharing someone else's private history without their consent can be a breach of trust.\n2. **Intent vs. Impact**: The author's intent was to be honest and possibly protect the boyfriend from being unaware of a serious issue. However, the impact was negative, causing conflict and estrangement.\n3. **Assumptions and Judgment**: The author made assumptions about how the boyfriend would react and whether the sister was being truthful about her past. This could indicate overstepping by not allowing the sister to disclose on her own terms.\n4. **Consequences**: The action led to the boyfriend lashing out and the sister cutting off the author. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend might not consider the boyfriend's right to process the information his own way.\n\nPossible perspectives:\n- **For the author (B not in the wrong)**: They might argue they were being honest and trying to prevent a potential repeat of abuse. They had a concern about the sister's well-being and felt compelled to act.\n- **Against the author (A in the wrong)**: They violated the sister's privacy, possibly causing more harm. The sister might feel betrayed, and the author didn't give her a chance to share her story herself.\n\nThe author's actions were well-intentioned but mishandled. The correct approach might have been to talk to the sister first, encourage her to disclose to the boyfriend, and respect her autonomy. Directly sharing without consent breaches trust and can have serious repercussions, as seen here. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
