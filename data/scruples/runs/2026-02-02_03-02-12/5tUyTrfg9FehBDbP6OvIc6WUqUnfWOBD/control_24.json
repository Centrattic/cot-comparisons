I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about them telling their sister's boyfriend the truth about their sister's past abusive relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister was in an abusive situation where her ex was a pimp, and she's now with a new guy they're serious about. The author thought it was wrong to keep this past hidden and decided to tell the boyfriend. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. On one hand, the author might believe they were protecting their sister's future partner by being honest. On the other hand, the sister might have chosen not to share that information, and the author overstepped by revealing it without her consent.\n\nThe sister's boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was right. However, family relationships and boundaries are tricky. The author's intention was to be truthful, but they might have violated the sister's privacy. The sister's response of cutting off the author is extreme, but the author's action could be seen as intrusive.\n\nI should consider if there were any obligations or rights here. The author isn't the one being directly affected by the sister's past, so maybe they shouldn't have shared it. Unless there was a risk of harm, which isn't clear here. The sister might have chosen to move on and not share her history, which is her right. The author's action could damage family relationships, so that's a negative outcome.\n\nBut maybe the author thought they were helping. However, it's possible that the sister had her reasons for not telling her partner, and the author's disclosure was a breach of trust. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's autonomy and privacy.\n\nAlternatively, if the sister's partner needed to know for his own protection or to make an informed decision, the author could argue they were doing the right thing. But usually, personal pasts are up to the individual to disclose. The author's role here isn't a legal guardian or someone with authority to share such information.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author likely overstepped by disclosing private information without permission, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any other angle. The parents also mentioned they weren't sure if the partner knew, but that doesn't justify the author's action. The key issue is the sister's right to control her own narrative.\n"
