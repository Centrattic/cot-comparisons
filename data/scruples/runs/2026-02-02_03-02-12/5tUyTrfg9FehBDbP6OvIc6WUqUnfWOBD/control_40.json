I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the sister's boyfriend was in a serious relationship, possibly marriage plans, with the author's sister. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp. The author told the boyfriend about this history, which led to the boyfriend yelling and throwing the author out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by sharing this information without the sister's consent. The author's reasoning was that it's wrong for the sister to be in a relationship without revealing such a major detail. But does the author have the right to disclose this private information?\n\nIn many cases, family members might have different opinions on boundaries. The author might think they're protecting their sister from a potential bad situation by ensuring the boyfriend knows the truth. However, by revealing the sister's past without her permission, the author could be violating her privacy. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her history, maybe she's not ready, or maybe the boyfriend already knew. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, which could indicate he was unprepared or reacted poorly, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to tell him. However, the key issue here is the confidentiality. The sister's past is her story to share. The author's intent might have been good, but the action could be seen as a breach of trust between the sister and the boyfriend.\n\nAlso, the author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, which might mean the author felt it was their duty to inform him. But without the sister's consent, this could be seen as overstepping. The sister cutting off the author is a strong reaction, but it's her right if she feels her privacy was violated.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they shared personal information without the sister's permission, even if their intentions were good. Privacy is important, and family members should respect each other's boundaries. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
