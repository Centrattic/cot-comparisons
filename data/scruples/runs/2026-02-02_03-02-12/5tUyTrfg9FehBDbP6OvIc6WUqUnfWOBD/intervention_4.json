I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend the truth about their sister's past. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship, including being pimped, before returning to her parents. The author mentioned this to their parents, who then expressed doubt about whether the boyfriend knew. The author decided to directly tell the boyfriend, leading to a hostile reaction and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to share information they believed was important for the boyfriend to know, especially since the sister was planning to marry him. The sister's past is significant, and the author felt it was a major issue that might affect the relationship. However, the way the information was shared could be problematic. The author didn't consult the sister first, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Family members have a right to privacy, and the author might have overstepped by sharing personal and sensitive details without permission.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was aggressive, which might indicate that he didn't handle the information well, but his response doesn't necessarily absolve the author of wrongdoing. The key here is whether the author had the right to disclose that information. While the intention was to protect the sister from potential harm, the method of disclosure might have been inappropriate. The sister could feel that her privacy was violated, leading to the fallout with the author.\n\nAdditionally, the author's assumption about the sister's agency in her past relationship could be a point of contention. The author isn't sure if the sister's claims about her lack of agency are accurate, but that's a subjective judgment. Sharing that doubt could add insult to injury if the sister feels it's questioning her experience.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between protecting someone you care about and respecting their autonomy and privacy. The author might have good intentions, but the approach was flawed. The sister's reaction suggests that she values her privacy and might not want her past discussed without her consent. The author's actions, while well-meaning, resulted in losing a relationship with their sister, which is a significant consequence.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their actions did cross a boundary. However, the question is whether they are \"in the wrong\" which can be a matter of perspective. The boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the sister's response also indicates that the author's actions were hurtful. In such cases, the line between right and wrong can be blurry. The author might have acted out of concern, but the method was inappropriate. Therefore, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't seek the sister's permission and possibly overstepped.\n"
