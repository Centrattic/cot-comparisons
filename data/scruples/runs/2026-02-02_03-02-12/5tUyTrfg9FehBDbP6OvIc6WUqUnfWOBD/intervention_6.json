I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. The author's sister was in an abusive relationship where the ex-boyfriend was like a pimp, and the sister is now in a serious relationship with someone new. The author told the new boyfriend about the past, thinking it was important for him to know. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister is now cutting the author out of her life.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want to know if I agree. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's sister was in an abusive situation and has been hiding it from her current partner. The author feels that the boyfriend has a right to know this because it's a major part of her sister's history that could affect their relationship. However, the author didn't go through the sister to share this information; they went directly to the boyfriend. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention might be to protect the boyfriend from potentially getting hurt if he's unaware of the sister's past. On the other hand, the author didn't consult the sister first, so it's a breach of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was violated, even if the author's motives were good. The sister's reaction is strong, cutting off the author, which suggests that the sister values her privacy and autonomy over the author's concern.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction was negative, which could be because he felt blindsided or that the author overstepped. The author might not have considered that the sister might have chosen not to disclose her past for her own reasons, including her healing process or the current relationship's dynamics. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might have the intention to do good, but the method of disclosure is questionable. Usually, such sensitive information is shared by the person directly involved, not a third party, unless there's a risk of harm. However, the sister's past abuse is her story to tell. The author's action could be seen as a violation of the sister's autonomy and privacy, even if the intent was to protect the boyfriend. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the boyfriend has a right to know about potential red flags in a serious relationship. However, the author's sister might have her reasons for not disclosing, such as fear of judgment, wanting to move on, or not wanting to relive traumatic experiences. The author's approach might have been confrontational and not sensitive to those factors. \n\nSo, considering all angles, while the author's intention might be understandable, the action of disclosing without the sister's consent could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author was trying to protect the boyfriend and that the sister's partner should know, but the method of disclosure is crucial here. Since the author didn't go through the sister first, it's a breach of trust, which complicates the situation.\n"
