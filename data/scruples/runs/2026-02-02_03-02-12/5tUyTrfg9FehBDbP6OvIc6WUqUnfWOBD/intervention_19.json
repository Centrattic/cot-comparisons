I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her abusive past. The situation involves the sister's previous relationship where she was abused and possibly pimped, which the author is uncertain about her agency in. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author decided to inform him directly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister had a traumatic experience, and the author felt that hiding this history was a problem. The author's intention was to protect their sister by being honest, thinking that the boyfriend should know such a significant detail before considering marriage. However, the way the information was delivered might be a factor. The author confronted the boyfriend alone, which could be seen as a breach of trust if the sister hadn't shared it herself. \n\nThen there's the reaction. The boyfriend yelled and threw the author out, which is definitely not a good response. The sister then cut off the author, which is harsh. The question is whether the author did the right thing by revealing the information without the sister's consent. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, family members often have different opinions on when to share personal information. The author might have thought they were acting in their sister's best interest, but the sister might feel that her privacy was violated. The boyfriend's aggressive reaction is concerning, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to tell him. \n\nI also wonder about the sister's agency. The author is unsure if the sister's claims about her lack of agency are true. If the sister is now in a healthy relationship, maybe she felt ready to move on and didn't want her past to be brought up. The author's action could have caused unnecessary conflict. \n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid. It's important for someone considering marriage to know about a partner's significant past, especially involving abuse. But the method of disclosure matters. It might have been better to talk to the sister first and get her consent to share the information. \n\nSo, the author's intention was to help, but the approach could be seen as overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction is inexcusable, and the sister's response is extreme. But the main issue is whether the author had the right to disclose the information without the sister's permission. That's a gray area. On one hand, it's about her safety and the boyfriend's awareness. On the other, the sister might have wanted to handle it herself. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author had a right to intervene. If the sister was in danger, maybe it's justified. But since the sister is now living with her parents and the relationship is serious, perhaps the author didn't have the right to share that information without her consent. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy. But if the author believed the sister was being manipulative or hiding something dangerous, maybe they're not. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The possible answer is B, but I need to weigh the pros and cons carefully. The key points are the sister's consent, the method of disclosure, and the potential harm caused. The author's action led to a breakdown in family relationships, which is a significant consequence. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might have had good intentions, but the action of revealing the information without the sister's approval was a violation of her privacy. Therefore, the answer could be A, but there are mitigating factors. However, based on the information given, the author probably is in the wrong. Wait, but the user says they think the author isn't. Maybe I should consider the context more. If the sister's past is crucial for the boyfriend to know, then the author's action was necessary. But the sister is the one who has the right to decide when and how to share her story. So, the answer is A because the author didn't get the sister's permission first. But the sister's response is also extreme. Hmm, this is tricky. I'm leaning towards A because the author's action crossed a boundary, but the situation is complex. The correct answer might be A.\n"
