I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a sister who's in a serious relationship, and the author (the sibling) told the boyfriend about her sister's past abuse. The sister had a previous boyfriend who was abusive, and the author thought it was wrong that she didn't disclose that to her current boyfriend. The author then told the boyfriend the truth, which led to being yelled at and thrown out, and the sister cutting off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and boundaries here. The sister's past is a personal and sensitive issue. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing by protecting the boyfriend from what they considered a potential problem. However, the sister hadn't told her boyfriend, so the author took it upon themselves to do so without the sister's consent. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author overstepped. In some cases, family members might feel it's their duty to intervene, especially if they believe someone is in danger. However, the sister's agency is important. Even if the author is skeptical about how much agency the sister had in her past situation, it's the sister's story to tell. By revealing that information without her permission, the author might have violated her privacy and trust.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise and emotional distress rather than being \"bad.\" The author assumed the boyfriend didn't know, but the sister's reaction to cutting off the author might indicate that she felt betrayed. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend might have been too harsh, especially without knowing the full context of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had concerns about the sister's safety and the boyfriend's awareness. If the sister was hiding a serious issue, maybe the author had a point in wanting the boyfriend to know. But the method of disclosure without the sister's consent could be problematic. The key is consent and the right to privacy. Even with good intentions, the author didn't have the right to disclose such personal information unless there was a clear risk of harm, which the situation doesn't explicitly state.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without the sister's permission, which led to family conflict. However, if the author believed the sister was in immediate danger, that could change things. But in this case, the sister is in a serious relationship, and the author's action led to a breakdown in the family relationship. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the breach of trust and privacy.\n"
