I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The story says the sister was in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp's girlfriend, and she's now with someone serious, even talking marriage. The author told the boyfriend, thinking it was important he knew. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend by informing him of the sister's history, which could affect their relationship. However, there's a line between helping and overstepping. The sister might have chosen not to tell the boyfriend herself, possibly because she didn't want to burden him or because she's moved on. The author didn't consult the sister first, which is a problem. They assumed they had the right to share private information without consent.\n\nBut then, the sister's history is significant. If the boyfriend didn't know, maybe the author did the right thing in revealing the truth to protect him from potential issues later. However, the method of disclosure was direct and without the sister's permission. The sister might see this as a betrayal of trust. The boyfriend's reaction was extreme, but the author's action led to that. \n\nAlso, the author's judgment about the sister's agency in her past situation might be biased. They mention they're unsure if the sister had little agency, but that's their own opinion. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing, like fear of rejection or wanting to move forward. The author's decision to share this info could have been well-intentioned but invasive.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author didn't check with the sister first. Family dynamics can be complex here. The parents were also involved, but the author took it upon themselves to act. The boyfriend's anger might be justified if he felt the information was shared without consent. The sister's cutting off the author is her choice, but the author might have overstepped their role as a sibling. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private family information without consent, even with good intentions. The right approach might have been to talk to the sister first and support her in disclosing to the boyfriend if she chose to. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
