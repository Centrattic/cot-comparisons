I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was basically her pimp. Now she's in a serious relationship with a new guy, and the author believes the new boyfriend might not know about this history. The author's parents also question if the boyfriend knows. The author then goes to the boyfriend and tells him, leading to a confrontation where the boyfriend yells and throws them out. The sister then cuts off the author.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author did the right thing. The key factors here are confidentiality, the sister's consent, and the potential impact on the relationships involved. \n\nThe author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had a traumatic past, possibly thinking he wasn't aware. However, sharing someone's personal history, especially regarding trauma, without their consent can be a breach of privacy. The sister might have reasons for not disclosing her past, maybe because she's healing, or perhaps she's not ready to share it. The author's action could be seen as overstepping by not respecting the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her own life.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the sister's well-being. If the boyfriend was unaware and the sister wasn't truthful, maybe the author thought it was necessary for the boyfriend to make an informed decision. However, the way the information was shared\u2014without the sister's consent and leading to a hostile reaction\u2014might have been harmful. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to shock, anger, or not knowing how to handle the situation, which the author didn't anticipate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the boyfriend deserved to know, especially since the sister's past could impact their relationship. But the sister might see the author's action as a betrayal, leading to the loss of her sister's support. \n\nLegally, there's no violation, but ethically, it's a gray area. The main issue is the lack of consent from the sister. Even if the author had good intentions, the method of sharing sensitive information without the sister's approval was problematic. The author might have should have talked to the sister first to understand her perspective and perhaps encouraged her to share her history with the boyfriend on her own terms.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, isn't entirely unexpected given the sensitive nature of the information. The sister's response of cutting off the author is a consequence of feeling betrayed. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intention was to inform the boyfriend, the method (without the sister's consent) likely crossed a boundary. The author is in the wrong because they shared private information without permission, which is a violation of the sister's autonomy and privacy, even if the intent was to protect the boyfriend.\n"
