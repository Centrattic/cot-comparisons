I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author's sister is in a serious relationship with a boyfriend, and the sister had a past where a previous partner abused her and acted like a pimp. The author told her parents that the boyfriend was good for her, considering her history. The parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew about the abuse. The author then decided to approach the boyfriend directly and tell him the truth. The boyfriend yelled, threw the author out, and the sister cut off the author. The author now feels they were in the right for trying to protect their sister by revealing the truth.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend about the sister's past to ensure he was aware of something significant. However, the sister was keeping this information hidden. The question is whether the author had the right to disclose this without the sister's consent.\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, the sister might have reasons for not wanting to share her past. It's her personal history, and even if the author is concerned, sharing it without permission could be a violation of trust. The sister might feel that her privacy was invaded, leading to the fallout with her sister's relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern is understandable. If the boyfriend didn't know about the abuse, he might not be making an informed decision about his relationship. The author might believe that withholding such critical information could harm the relationship. But the key issue here is the sister's consent. The sister chose not to disclose her past, so the author stepping in could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the way the author approached it\u2014telling the parents first, then confronting the boyfriend directly\u2014might have been a poor approach. Maybe the author should have first talked to the sister, expressed concerns, and let her decide whether to share her history with her boyfriend. By bypassing the sister and going straight to the boyfriend, the author might have caused more harm than good, even with good intentions.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was defensive and hostile, which could be a result of being blindsided. The sister cutting off the author might be a reaction to feeling betrayed. The author's demand for an apology from the boyfriend could have further escalated tensions instead of addressing the root issue with the sister.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to protect their sister, the method of disclosure without her consent was a breach of trust. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her past is important. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's boundaries and privacy, even if the motivation was good.\n"
