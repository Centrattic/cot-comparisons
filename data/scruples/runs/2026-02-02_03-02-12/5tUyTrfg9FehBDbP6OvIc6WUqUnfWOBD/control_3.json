I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was essentially a pimp. She's now dating someone new, and the author feels that hiding this history is wrong. The author tells the boyfriend, who reacts negatively. The sister then cuts off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent was to share the truth because they believed the boyfriend should know. But the sister didn't disclose this herself, and the author took it upon themselves to do so. The boyfriend's reaction was hostile, and the sister is now upset with the author.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main ethical consideration here is about confidentiality and consent. The sister didn't share her past with her boyfriend, so the author disclosing it without her permission could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention was good, they might have overstepped by not respecting their sister's autonomy to decide what to share.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concern might be valid. The boyfriend being unaware of such a significant part of the sister's history could affect their relationship. However, the author didn't consult with the sister first, which could be a mistake. They assumed they knew what was best without considering the sister's perspective on how to handle it.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's agency. The author mentions being unsure if the sister had as little agency as she claims. But that's the sister's story, and unless there's evidence otherwise, the author shouldn't question her experience. The author's judgment about her sister's past might not be their place to make.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author's method of disclosure might have been abrupt. Approaching the boyfriend directly without discussing it with the sister first could have caused more harm. The sister now feels betrayed, leading her to cut off the author. This outcome suggests that the author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, led to negative consequences without the sister's consent.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did not get permission to disclose personal information. Even if the information is important, sharing it without consent can damage relationships. The sister's right to privacy and control over her own story is a key factor here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's action was a privacy violation, even if motivated by concern. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy and confidentiality.\n"
