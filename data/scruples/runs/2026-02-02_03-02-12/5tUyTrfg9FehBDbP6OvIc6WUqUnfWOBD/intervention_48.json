I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where her ex acted like a pimp. The author told the boyfriend about this, thinking it was important given their serious relationship plans. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect their sister's partner from being unaware of her past, which could affect their relationship. But was it the author's place to do that? The sister might have chosen not to reveal that information for her own reasons, maybe to protect herself or for other personal reasons. By sharing this information without the sister's consent, the author could be seen as violating her privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they were doing the right thing by being honest about a significant issue that could impact the relationship. However, the way it was handled\u2014without consulting the sister first\u2014might be problematic. The boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but the author might not be responsible for how he took it. The sister cutting off the author adds complexity; maybe she felt her privacy was invaded.\n\nI need to weigh the right to privacy against the intention to prevent potential harm. In many cases, sharing someone's personal history without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intention is good. The sister might have her reasons for not disclosing her past, and the author's actions could have damaged both their relationships. So, while the author had good intentions, acting without the sister's permission might make them at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information without consent, which is a violation of privacy.\n"
