I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about her past. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was abusive and maybe even like a pimp. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to not tell her current boyfriend about that. So they went to the boyfriend and told him, but he got really angry and kicked them out. Now the sister is mad and cut them off.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about privacy and consent. The sister didn't tell her boyfriend about her past, so the author decided to do it for her. But was that okay? The author says they're unsure about how much agency the sister had in her previous relationship, but they still chose to share that info. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, which adds to the confusion.\n\nOn one hand, the author might think they're helping by making sure the boyfriend knows the truth, so he can make an informed decision. But on the other hand, the sister might have chosen not to share that part of her history, maybe because it's personal or she's not ready to talk about it. The author went behind her back, which could be seen as violating her privacy. Even if the intention was good, sharing someone else's personal information without their consent can be a big issue. The boyfriend's reaction was negative, which might mean he felt betrayed or that the sister wasn't honest. However, the sister is now cutting off the author, which complicates things.\n\nI think the main issue here is the lack of consent from the sister. The author assumed they had the right to share her past without asking her. Even if they believed it was the right thing to do, respecting someone's privacy and autonomy is important. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate with their sister first. But maybe there's a gray area if the sister's safety is a concern, but the problem here seems more about the sister's choice to disclose or not. So probably answer A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
