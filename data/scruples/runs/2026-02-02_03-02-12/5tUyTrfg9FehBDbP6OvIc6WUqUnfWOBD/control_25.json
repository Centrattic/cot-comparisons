I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the sister's boyfriend not knowing about her past abuse. The author told him, leading to a bad reaction and the sister cutting them off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister had a history of being abused by a previous boyfriend, who was like a pimp. The author thinks she's hiding this from her current boyfriend. The parents were unsure if he knew, so the author decided to tell him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister is now upset and has cut off the author.\n\nThe main question is whether the author overstepped by revealing the sister's private information. The sister might have chosen not to share her past with her boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, or she's working through it, or perhaps she feels it's not relevant. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, but without the sister's consent, they disclosed something personal.\n\nConfidentiality and consent are big here. The author might not have the right to share the sister's sensitive information, even if they think they're helping. The sister's autonomy in deciding what to share about her own experiences is important. The author's action could be seen as violating trust, especially if the sister didn't want that part of her history to be disclosed.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they were doing the right thing to protect the boyfriend. But there's a line between helping and overstepping. The boyfriend's reaction is harsh, but the author's method of disclosure could have been better. Maybe approaching the situation differently, like encouraging the sister to share the information herself, would have been more respectful.\n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a consequence of the author's actions. If the author acted without the sister's permission, it's understandable that she's upset. The key issue is whether the author had the right to disclose such personal information without her consent. Since the sister's information is private, the author might be in the wrong for breaching that trust, regardless of their intentions.\n"
