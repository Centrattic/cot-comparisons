I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the situation: the sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex was like a pimp. The sister is now with a new boyfriend, and the author (the sister's sibling) told the boyfriend about the sister's history without her consent. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author thinks it's wrong that the sister didn't disclose her past to the boyfriend. But the author took it upon themselves to inform the boyfriend, which led to conflict. The sister then got angry and ended the relationship with the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider confidentiality and consent. The author didn't ask the sister if she was okay with sharing her history. Even if the author thought it was for the sister's good, sharing someone's personal trauma without their permission can be a breach of trust. The sister might have reasons for not telling her boyfriend, maybe she didn't want to burden him or feared rejection. The author's action could have violated the sister's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they were protecting their sister from potential harm if the boyfriend wasn't aware of her past. But the boyfriend's reaction was defensive, which might indicate that the author's approach was inappropriate. Also, the sister was upset because her boyfriend was told without her consent, leading her to cut off the author.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action crossed a boundary by disclosing private information without permission. The sister's right to control her own narrative is important. Even with good intentions, the author overstepped, making them at fault. So, the answer would lean towards AITA being the author's fault, hence answer A.\n"
