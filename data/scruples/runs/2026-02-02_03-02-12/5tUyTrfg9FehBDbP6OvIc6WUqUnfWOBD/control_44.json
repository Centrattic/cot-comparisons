I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse and pimping. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was abusive and essentially a pimp. She's now in a serious relationship with a new guy, and the author believes it's wrong to keep this past hidden. The author told the boyfriend, who reacted angrily, and then the sister cut off the author.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. Let's break it down. The sister might have a right to privacy, but the author believes the boyfriend should know about the past. However, sharing personal information without permission can be a breach of trust. The sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her history, which is her decision unless there's a risk of harm. \n\nThe author's parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, which adds confusion. The author might have thought they were protecting the sister from a potential bad relationship by ensuring the boyfriend was aware. But the sister reacted by cutting ties, which is a big consequence.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's privacy and autonomy are important. The author might have overstepped by not discussing it with the sister first. Even if the author felt the boyfriend should know, going behind the sister's back could damage the relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was harsh, but maybe he was upset because the sister hadn't told him, which could indicate she didn't feel safe to share. The author's approach might have been unkind and invasive. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's privacy and for not having a conversation with her first. The sister's reaction, while extreme, might stem from feeling betrayed. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
