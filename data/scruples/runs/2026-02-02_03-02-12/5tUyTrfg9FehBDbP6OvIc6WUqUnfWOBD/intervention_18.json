I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author's sister was in an abusive relationship where her ex-boyfriend was essentially her pimp. She's now dating someone new, and the author told the new boyfriend about the sister's history without her consent. The sister's current boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author's sister had a traumatic past involving abuse and exploitation. The author is concerned about the new boyfriend not knowing the full story, which could affect their relationship. The author's intention was to inform the boyfriend to protect him from potential future issues. But did they have the right to do that without the sister's permission?\n\nOn one hand, the author might believe they were acting in the boyfriend's best interest and perhaps even in their sister's, if being in a relationship without full disclosure isn't healthy. However, privacy is a big factor here. The sister might have chosen to keep her past private for various reasons\u2014maybe she's healing, or she wants to move on without the past affecting her current relationship. The author's action could be seen as a violation of that privacy, regardless of the intention.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's agency. The author mentions they're unsure if the sister truly had little agency in the previous situation. That suggests the author might be doubting the sister's account of her own experiences. But even if the author has doubts, they should probably talk to the sister first rather than go to the boyfriend. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was anger and yelling. That could indicate that the information was unexpected and perhaps sensitive. The author might have assumed the boyfriend didn't know, but maybe the sister had already shared it with him, or he had other reasons for his reaction. \n\nThe sister cutting off the author is a strong response. The author might feel justified if they believe they were protecting the boyfriend, but the sister might see it as betrayal. There's also the aspect of family dynamics and boundaries. The author might have overstepped by sharing personal information without consent.\n\nIn many cases, people have a right to privacy, even if the information is about something traumatic. The author's actions could be seen as well-meaning but invasive. Unless there was an immediate danger or threat to the boyfriend that required disclosure, the author might not have the right to share such personal details. \n\nHowever, if the sister was in a situation where her past could affect her current relationship in a harmful way, the author might think they're helping. But again, the method of disclosure matters. Approaching the sister first, then involving the boyfriend if necessary, could be a better approach.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might be good, sharing someone else's personal and traumatic history without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. The sister's anger and cutting off the author suggests that the action was perceived as a betrayal. So, even if the author thought they were doing the right thing, the method was inappropriate.\n"
