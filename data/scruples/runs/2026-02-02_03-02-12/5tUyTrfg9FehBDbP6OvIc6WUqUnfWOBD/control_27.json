I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling her sister's boyfriend about her sister's past. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship, which was serious. The author thinks her sister might not be being honest about her agency in that situation. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware of the abuse. The author decided to tell him directly, which led to a confrontation and the sister cutting ties.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's boyfriend had a right to know about such a significant part of her past, especially since they're planning marriage. However, the method the author used is questionable. Telling someone a close relative's private history without their consent can be seen as a breach of privacy. The sister might have wanted to share that information herself in her own time. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend, but maybe she overstepped by not discussing it with her sister first. The boyfriend's angry reaction could be due to surprise or feeling betrayed, but the author's actions were well-meaning. Still, the sister's decision to cut off the author might be her way of defending her partner's privacy. So, it's a tricky situation where both sides have valid points. The author might not be entirely wrong, but she definitely crossed a boundary without considering her sister's wishes.\n"
