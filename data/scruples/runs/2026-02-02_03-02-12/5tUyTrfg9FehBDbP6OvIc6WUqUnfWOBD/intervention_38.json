I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abusive relationship. The sister had been in a situation where her ex-boyfriend was abusive and acted like a pimp, and she's now in a serious relationship. The author thought it was wrong to not tell the boyfriend about this history, so they went to him directly and told him. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister then cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend by sharing information that could affect his decision to marry the sister. However, the author didn't consult the sister first, so maybe that's a problem. The sister might have reasons for keeping that information private, like privacy, healing, or personal autonomy. By disclosing it without her consent, the author might have violated her trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a right to know about his partner's past, especially if it involved abuse. The author's actions could be seen as trying to help the boyfriend make an informed decision. However, the method of disclosure\u2014going directly to the boyfriend without discussing it with the sister first\u2014could have been inappropriate. The sister might have wanted to share her story on her own terms, which the author didn't respect.\n\nAlso, the reaction from the boyfriend was harsh. He yelled and threw the author out, which might indicate that he wasn't ready to hear it or that the author's approach was too confrontational. The sister's response cutting off the author adds to the conflict, showing that the sister feels betrayed.\n\nBut then, should the author have approached the sister first instead of the boyfriend? Maybe the author thought the sister wasn't being honest with the boyfriend, so they took matters into their own hands. However, that's a breach of trust. The author's role here is complicated because they're trying to act in what they believe is the right way, but without considering the sister's autonomy and privacy.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's confidentiality. Even if the information is important, sharing it without consent can damage relationships. The boyfriend's right to know is important, but the sister's right to control her narrative is also crucial. The author didn't balance these two aspects, leading to conflict.\n\nAlternatively, if the author truly believed the sister was in danger or the boyfriend was being deceived, then maybe their intent was good. But the method was flawed. The problem is that the author assumed they knew what was best without discussing it with the sister. In most ethical frameworks, consent and respect for personal boundaries are key factors. So, the author's actions cross the line by not getting the sister's consent first.\n\nTherefore, considering all angles, the author is in the wrong because they disclosed sensitive information without the sister's permission, which led to a breakdown in trust and relationships.\n"
