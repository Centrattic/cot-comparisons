I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their sister's boyfriend. The sister was in an abusive relationship with her ex, which involved abuse and being pimped. The author told the boyfriend about this history, and the boyfriend reacted angrily, leading to a fallout with the sister.\n\nFirst, the author's intention: they thought it was wrong that the sister was keeping this secret. They believed the boyfriend should know because it's a major issue that might affect their relationship. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so maybe the author felt a duty to inform him. But was that their place? \n\nSiblings have a complicated relationship. The author might have felt protective of their sister, maybe even concerned about her new boyfriend's intentions. However, by revealing such personal information without the sister's consent, the author might have overstepped. The sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her past, possibly for her own reasons or because she felt ready to move on. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was extreme\u2014he yelled and threw the author out. But that doesn't necessarily make the author right. The key question is whether the author had the right to share that information. Confidentiality is important in family dynamics. Even if the author had good intentions, they didn't consider the sister's autonomy in deciding what to share. \n\nThe sister then cut off the author, which is a consequence of the author's action. The author now wants an apology from the boyfriend, but the sister refuses. The author might not be in the wrong if they believed they were protecting their sister, but the method of sharing sensitive info without consent is problematic. \n\nSo, the author's actions led to conflict. The line between helping and overstepping was crossed. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they disclosed private information without permission, which is a breach of trust. However, there's nuance because the author had concerns about the sister's well-being. But the ethical issue here is the unauthorized disclosure. So, the answer is A.\n"
