I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was pimped out, and she's now with a new guy who they think might not know this. The author tells the boyfriend, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect their sister by ensuring the new partner was fully aware of her history. But the boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author. \n\nI should think about boundaries here. The sister might feel that her privacy was invaded by the author sharing this information without her consent. Even if the author's motives were good, sharing such personal details without permission could be seen as overstepping. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction was extreme, which might indicate that the sister didn't disclose her past, and the author felt it was necessary to protect her from entering another abusive situation. The boyfriend's anger might be due to feeling blindsided, which could be justified if the sister never told him. \n\nBut the question is about the author's fault. The author's action was based on concern, but they bypassed the sister's consent. In many cases, even with good intentions, sharing someone else's private information without their permission can be considered a breach of trust. The sister's reaction suggests she valued her privacy and autonomy over the author's intervention.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions were to help, the method was problematic. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's boundaries by disclosing personal information without her consent.\n"
