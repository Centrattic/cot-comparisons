I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about a past abusive relationship. The sister was in an abusive situation where her ex was like a pimp, and the author thinks it's wrong that the boyfriend didn't know. The parents also weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, so the author went to the boyfriend and told him. The boyfriend reacted badly, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister was in a serious relationship, and there's a question of whether she had a duty to disclose her past. The author's sister might be hiding that information, possibly to protect her current relationship. The author stepped in, thinking it was important for the boyfriend to know, but did she overstep?\n\nConfidentiality is a big factor here. The sister might have entrusted the author with that information, but the author is sharing it without the sister's consent. Even if the author doesn't believe the sister had no agency, that's the sister's own story, and the author is choosing to reveal it. The parents were also unsure, so maybe they didn't know either.\n\nThe author's intention was to help the boyfriend by informing him. But relationships are private, and the sister might have chosen not to disclose for various reasons\u2014maybe she felt it was in the past, or she was still working on it. The author's actions could be seen as invading the sister's privacy. Additionally, the sister's reaction of cutting off the author is her own choice, but the question is about the author's rightness.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author questioning the sister's account of her past. The author isn't sure if the sister had no agency, which might mean the author is doubting the sister's story. That could be a sensitive issue; even if the author has doubts, sharing that with the boyfriend without the sister's consent crosses a boundary.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is extreme, but it's his right to feel upset if someone he's in a serious relationship with didn't tell him. However, the author's method of revealing the information directly to him without the sister's consent might be problematic. The author might have acted out of concern, but without considering the sister's autonomy in handling her own past.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a principle of non-maleficence\u2014do no harm. The author's action caused harm to the sister's relationship and their own relationship. There's also the question of whether the author had the right to act as a mediator in the sister's relationship. The sister might feel her privacy was violated, which is a significant breach.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without consent, even if their intentions were good. The sister has the right to decide what to share about her past, and the author overstepped by disclosing it to the boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, is a consequence of the sister's decision to keep it hidden and the author's disclosure. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
