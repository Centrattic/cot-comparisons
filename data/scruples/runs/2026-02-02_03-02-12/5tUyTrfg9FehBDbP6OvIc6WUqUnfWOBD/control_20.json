I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister was in an abusive relationship where she was treated as a pimp's victim. The author thinks the sister might not have had as little agency as she claims. The author told the boyfriend about this past, which led to the boyfriend reacting angrily and the sister cutting off the author. \n\nSo, the main question is: was the author right to disclose this information? Privacy is a big factor here. The sister might have chosen not to share her past with the boyfriend, and the author stepping in could have violated her privacy. Even if the author had good intentions, like protecting the boyfriend from being unaware of the sister's history, the sister's right to control her own narrative is important. \n\nThen there's the sister's reaction. She cut off the author after the boyfriend reacted negatively. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, which might have been seen as pressuring the couple. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially since the sister might not have wanted her past to be shared without her consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was concerned about the boyfriend not knowing about the sister's traumatic history, which could affect their relationship. However, even with good intentions, sharing someone else's personal information without their permission is generally considered a breach of trust. The sister might rely on the author's discretion, and the author's actions could have caused harm by damaging both her relationship and her standing with her sister.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author might be in the wrong because they shared private information without the sister's consent, which could have been a violation of her privacy and trust. Even if the author believed the boyfriend should know, it's the sister's responsibility to disclose her own past. The boyfriend's reaction and the sister's subsequent rejection of the author are consequences of this breach. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
