I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is about their sister's boyfriend not knowing that the sister was in an abusive relationship where she was basically a pimped girl. The author told the boyfriend the truth, and now there's a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has been hiding her past, which is pretty significant. The author believes that the boyfriend should know because it's a major red flag. The author's parents were unsure if the boyfriend knew, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him. Then the boyfriend reacted badly, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who has a traumatic past that could affect the relationship. But on the other hand, the author didn't check with the sister first, which might have been the more appropriate step. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the sister's agency. The author isn't sure if the sister had control over her previous situation, which complicates things. If the sister is hiding this information, maybe she's trying to move on, but the author thinks the boyfriend has a right to know. However, sharing someone's private information without their consent can be seen as a breach of trust, even if the intention is good.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which suggests he might not have wanted to hear that or maybe he felt betrayed. The sister then cut off the author. So, the author's action led to the loss of a relationship with their sister. \n\nI think the key factors here are consent and intent. Even with good intentions, sharing someone else's private information without their permission can be problematic. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but the sister's autonomy and right to privacy are important. The author should have discussed this with the sister first, perhaps, to understand her perspective and get her input before informing the boyfriend.\n\nHowever, if the situation involves abuse and potential harm, there's also an argument for the boyfriend having a right to know. But the method of disclosure matters. The author bypassed the sister entirely, which might have been a mistake. Instead, maybe they should have encouraged the sister to be honest with the boyfriend themselves.\n\nIn terms of the boyfriend's reaction, it's possible he was shocked and angry, but the author's approach might have been confrontational. Going directly to the boyfriend without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intentions were to protect the boyfriend, but the method might be in question. The answer hinges on whether the sister's privacy was unnecessarily violated, which it seems it was. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy and privacy, even if the intent was good.\n"
