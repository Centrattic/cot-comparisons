I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend the truth about their sister's past abuse. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was treated like a pimp's girl, and she's now in a serious relationship with someone. The author thought it was wrong that the boyfriend didn't know about this past and decided to tell him. The boyfriend then yelled and threw them out, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from being in a relationship with someone who had a traumatic past that the boyfriend wasn't aware of. But was it the author's place to do that? Family dynamics can be complicated. The sister might have chosen not to disclose that part of her history, maybe for reasons that aren't clear. The author might believe they're doing the right thing by ensuring the boyfriend knows the truth, but others might see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a right to know if his partner has a significant history that could affect the relationship. Abuse and pimping are serious issues. If the sister was hiding that, maybe the boyfriend wasn't fully informed, which could be a problem. However, the method of revealing the truth might be problematic. The author didn't go through the sister, didn't get consent, and just told the boyfriend directly. That could be seen as crossing a boundary, even with good intentions.\n\nThe sister's reaction to cutting off the author might be because she felt betrayed. If the author didn't discuss this with her first, she might see it as a violation of trust. The boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise or because he felt disrespected. The author might not have handled the situation sensitively. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the sister first, encourage her to share her history with the boyfriend, rather than doing it directly.\n\nSo, the question is: did the author have the right to disclose this information without the sister's consent? In many cases, sharing someone else's personal information without their permission can be seen as a breach of privacy, even if the intent is to help. However, if the information is material to the relationship (like a history of abuse), there might be an argument that the boyfriend has a right to know. But the way it was done is crucial. The author chose to bypass the sister entirely, which might have been the wrong approach.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were concerned about the boyfriend's well-being. However, they could have handled it differently by first discussing with the sister and respecting her boundaries. Since they didn't, and went ahead to disclose the information directly, that could be seen as overstepping. The sister's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions might have contributed to it by not considering the sister's wishes or privacy first.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they disclosed private information without the sister's consent, even if their intentions were good. The appropriate step would have been to talk to the sister first and let her decide whether to share her history with her boyfriend. By acting unilaterally, the author violated the sister's privacy, leading to the fallout.\n"
