I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past, which the sister had kept hidden. The boyfriend reacted angrily and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of sharing someone else's private information. The sister had a history of abuse, and the author felt that her current boyfriend should know. The author's parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, which adds a layer of uncertainty. The author's intention was to protect their sister, believing that the boyfriend might not have known and that the sister was hiding something major.\n\nHowever, sharing such sensitive information without consent is a big deal. Even if the author had good intentions, the sister might have had her reasons for not disclosing her past. Maybe she was trying to move on, or perhaps the boyfriend already knew and she chose not to share it with family. By revealing this information without the sister's permission, the author potentially violated her privacy and may have caused harm to her relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were acting out of concern for their sister's well-being, especially given the severity of the abuse. They could believe that the boyfriend needed to know to make an informed decision about the relationship. But the key issue here is consent and the right to privacy. Even with good intentions, divulging someone's personal history without their consent can be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was hostile, which might indicate he wasn't aware, but it's also possible he was upset because the author shared the information without the sister's approval. The sister's response of cutting off the author is a result of feeling betrayed by the author's actions. \n\nSo, considering the balance between protecting someone and respecting their autonomy and privacy, the author might be seen as overstepping. The right to control one's personal information is important, and the author didn't consult with the sister before sharing her history. Therefore, even if their intentions were good, the action of sharing without consent could be considered wrong. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the sister's manipulation of her previous relationship, which the author is skeptical about. However, that doesn't justify the author sharing information without permission. The author's concern about the sister's agency is valid, but the method of addressing it was inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's motives might be understandable, the action of revealing private information without consent is likely to be seen as wrong, making them at fault in this situation.\n"
