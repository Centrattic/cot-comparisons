I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's sister is in a serious relationship with a boyfriend for over a year, possibly planning marriage. The sister had a past where her previous boyfriend abused her and acted like a pimp. The author mentioned this to their parents, and the parents weren't sure if the current boyfriend knew about that history. The author thought it was wrong for the sister to be in a relationship without the boyfriend knowing this major issue. So the author went to the boyfriend directly and told him about the sister's past. The boyfriend reacted angrily, yelling and throwing them out. The author then asked for an apology from the boyfriend, but the sister cut off the author entirely.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points here are about the author's decision to disclose the sister's past to the boyfriend without the sister's consent. The sister's history is extremely sensitive\u2014domestic abuse and being pimped. These are serious issues that could impact the boyfriend's decision to stay in the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's wrong for the sister to be with someone without them knowing such a significant part of her past. But does that justify the author disclosing it without the sister's permission? On one hand, the author might believe they're acting in the sister's best interest or the boyfriend's, to prevent future harm. On the other hand, the sister might see this as a violation of her privacy and trust, especially since she might be trying to move past that trauma.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction suggests that he wasn't expecting this information and took it poorly. The sister then cut off the author. The author's approach might have been well-intentioned, but the method was invasive. In relationships, privacy and consent about sharing personal information are important. Even if the author thought it was necessary, sharing such sensitive information without the sister's consent could be seen as overstepping boundaries.\n\nAdditionally, the sister's agency in her past is questioned by the author. The author isn't sure if the sister had as little control as she claims. But that's not the author's place to judge. The sister's experience and how she interprets her own past is her story to tell. The author's judgment of her past might have influenced the decision to expose her to the boyfriend, which could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author acted without the sister's consent, violated her privacy, and caused a breakdown in their relationship. Even if the intention was good, the action was unauthorized and likely hurtful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
