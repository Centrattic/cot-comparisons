I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves the author telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. The sister had a history of being in an abusive relationship with her ex who was a pimp, and the author believes the boyfriend didn't know about this. The author told the boyfriend, who then reacted angrily, and the sister cut off the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the author's action. The key points here are confidentiality, intent, and the sister's autonomy. The author's intention was to protect the boyfriend from what they saw as a harmful situation. But did they have the right to disclose such personal information without the sister's consent? \n\nThe sister's history is very sensitive. Even if the author is skeptical about her sister's agency, the author doesn't have the authority to act as a gatekeeper of that information. The sister might have chosen not to share it with the boyfriend for various reasons\u2014maybe she's not ready, maybe she wants to handle it herself, or maybe there's a reason she hasn't told him. The author's decision to disclose could have violated the sister's privacy and autonomy. \n\nAlso, the author's parents mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, but the author took it upon themselves to inform him. That might have been an overstep, especially since the author isn't the one in the relationship. The boyfriend's reaction could be a result of being blindsided, even if he was unaware. \n\nThe sister's response cutting off the author is harsh, but maybe her reaction is due to feeling betrayed. The author's actions might have caused her significant emotional distress. Even if the author's intent was good, the method of disclosure was problematic. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of concern for the boyfriend's well-being. The author might believe they were helping by preventing the boyfriend from being in a potentially harmful situation. But that's a line between concern and overstepping. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author likely overstepped by not respecting the sister's privacy and autonomy. Even if the sister's past is concerning, the author isn't in a position to decide who can or can't know that information. The correct approach might have been to speak with the sister first, support her, and encourage her to share the information herself if she felt comfortable. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they violated their sister's privacy and autonomy without her consent.\n"
