I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the sister's boyfriend about the sister's abusive past. \n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship where she was manipulated, maybe even pimped out. The author feels that the current boyfriend should know about this because it's a major red flag. The parents didn't know if the boyfriend was aware, so the author took it upon themselves to inform him.\n\nBut wait, the sister might not have shared that information with her boyfriend. The author is stepping into a private matter, sharing something personal without consent. Even if the author's intention was to protect the boyfriend or the sister, the act of revealing private information without the sister's permission crosses a boundary. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was negative, which makes sense because he was confronted with sensitive info he wasn't expecting. The sister then cuts off the author, which is her right, but it shows the fallout from the author's actions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on consent and the right to privacy. The sister's experience is traumatic, and sharing such details without her consent could be seen as violating her trust. Even if the author thought it was for the best, the method was inappropriate. So, the author likely overstepped, making them at least partially in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
