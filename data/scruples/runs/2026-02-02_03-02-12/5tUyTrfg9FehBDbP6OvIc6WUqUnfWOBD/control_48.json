I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister's boyfriend about the sister's past. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister has a history of being in an abusive relationship, where she was pimped by her ex. She's now in a serious relationship with this guy, and the author believes the boyfriend doesn't know about her past. The author's parents were also unsure if the boyfriend knew. The author's motivation is that they think it's wrong for the sister to be in a relationship without disclosing such a major aspect of her history.\n\nThe author decides to tell the boyfriend directly. The boyfriend reacts negatively, yelling and throwing them out. Then the sister is upset and cuts off the author. The question is whether the author acted wrongly.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author's intention might be to protect the boyfriend from being misled and to ensure he's aware of potential red flags, especially considering the sister's past. This could be seen as trying to prevent future harm if the boyfriend isn't aware. However, the sister might have considered her past private and the author overstepped by not discussing it with her first. The sister's reaction suggests she felt her privacy was violated.\n\nBut wait, the author's parents also mentioned they weren't sure if the boyfriend knew, which adds to the author's belief that the information wasn't shared. The author might think that withholding such a significant history could lead to problems in the relationship. However, the sister might see her past as a personal matter, and the author's actions as meddling.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: In many places, you can't be sued for defamation just for sharing true information, but family dynamics are different. The key here is consent and privacy. The author shared information without the sister's consent. Even if the information is true, sharing it without the sister's permission could be seen as violating her privacy. The boyfriend has a right to know about his partner's past, especially if it's relevant to their relationship, but the method of disclosure matters.\n\nThe author could have approached the sister first, expressed concerns, and encouraged her to be transparent with the boyfriend. Instead, they went directly to the boyfriend, which might have been a breach of trust. The sister's response indicates that the author's actions hurt her relationship and caused her to cut ties, which is a significant consequence.\n\nSo, the author's intention might have been good, but the method was flawed. The right approach would have been to talk to the sister first. By not doing so, the author didn't respect the sister's autonomy and privacy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
