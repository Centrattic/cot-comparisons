I am unsure if I believe how little agency she claims she had in the situation. My parents then shocked me by saying that they weren't sure if he knew what happened.\n\nI thought it was wrong of her to be with this guy while concealing something so major that would make most guys not want to be with her. I went over to their apartment and took her boyfriend aside and told him. He did not react as expected, but instead he started yelling at me, telling me I'm terrible and disgusting and he threw me out of their apartment. I don't know if he actually knew or if he was surprised by the news and taking it out on me.\n\nI reached out to my sister and told her that if I was going to be in her life, I would need a heartfelt apology from her boyfriend from reacting so cruelly, and she responded by telling me she doesn't want me in her life and I can fuck off. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation (the author) is in the wrong for telling her sister's boyfriend about the sister's past abuse. \n\nFirst, the sister was in an abusive relationship where she was essentially pimped out by her ex. Her current boyfriend didn't know about this history. The author thought it was wrong to keep this from him, so she told him directly. The boyfriend reacted angrily, and the sister then cut the author off.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention and the method she used. The author's motivation was to protect her sister's boyfriend from being in a relationship without full disclosure. However, the sister might have wanted to handle this herself, and the author didn't consult her before sharing the information.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's a balance between protecting someone and respecting others' privacy. The author might believe she was acting in the boyfriend's best interest, but she bypassed the sister's consent. The sister's right to control her own narrative is important. Even if the author suspected the sister was hiding the truth, she had no authority to disclose it without the sister's permission. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be due to surprise, anger, or feeling betrayed. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the sister didn't want the information shared. The sister's response is harsh, but the author's method was invasive. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial, but the sister might have valid reasons for not disclosing the past yet. The author's judgment about the sister's agency is her own, but that doesn't justify sharing private information without consent. \n\nTherefore, while the author had good intentions, she violated the sister's privacy and autonomy, which makes her at least partly in the wrong.\n"
