We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author asked Casey to go back to his place to \"fool around\" on their first date, which she declined. He thought she had a crush on him for months, so he expected her to be okay with that. When she said no, he lost interest and stopped responding to her texts. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole for ghosting her.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points here are consent, expectations, and communication. The author approached Casey with a clear expectation of physical intimacy on the first date. She declined, stating she wanted to take things slower. He then ghosted her because his interest was tied to her agreeing to his terms. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost someone because they didn't meet your expectations? Well, people have different boundaries. Ghosting isn't usually respectful, but if he's honest about not wanting to continue, maybe that's better. However, he did say he's \"big on being honest,\" so maybe he should have communicated his feelings instead of cutting off contact. \n\nBut wait, the author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't comply. That's a bit problematic because it implies that his interest was conditional on her agreeing to sex. That could be seen as objectifying her, especially since she had expressed interest before. However, he's not pressuring her beyond asking. He just expected a different outcome. \n\nOn the other hand, ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused. Casey might have been hurt or concerned, but the author didn't explain his feelings. Is it the author's fault for not being honest? Maybe. If he wanted to end things, he should have communicated that, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If his actions were based on his own expectations, but he didn't respect her boundaries by moving on after she said no, maybe he is. However, people have different standards. Some might say it's a personal choice, others might argue that it's dismissive of her wishes. \n\nI think the key is the lack of communication. He didn't explain why he stopped talking, which leaves Casey in the dark. Even if his reasons are personal, cutting off without a word is considered ghosting, which is generally frowned upon. So maybe he's in the wrong for not being honest about his feelings, even if his initial request was his own choice.\n"
