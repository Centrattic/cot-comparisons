We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author asked bluntly if she wanted to go back to his place and was rejected. He then lost interest and hasn't responded much since, which is ghosting.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you cut off communication without explanation. But the author says he lost all interest, so maybe he's just moving on. But was it wrong to ghost? Also, he mentions she had a crush on him for months. Did he set expectations by asking so early? Maybe. It's common to build a relationship before intimacy, but the author wanted immediate sex, which might not align with her values. \n\nHe also talks about the money spent on the date, which adds a transactional element. That's a red flag. Prioritizing money over mutual respect isn't good. She wanted to take it slow, and he ghosted because he didn't get what he wanted. That's probably inconsiderate. Even if he's honest, dismissing her after a rejection without communication is still ghosting. So, even if he's not malicious, cutting her off without closure is inconsiderate. \n\nBut some might argue that if someone isn't interested, they have the right to disengage. However, the way he did it\u2014ghosting\u2014could be seen as rude. He didn't explain his feelings or why he's pulling away. So maybe the wrong isn't in losing interest, but in how he handled it. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of ghosting and lack of communication, even if his feelings are valid.\n"
