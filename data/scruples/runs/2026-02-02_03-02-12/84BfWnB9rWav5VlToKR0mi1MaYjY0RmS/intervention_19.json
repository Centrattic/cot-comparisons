We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone because she didn't have sex on the first date. The author asked bluntly if they could go back to his place and she said no, then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. But there might be context. The author felt disinterested after being rejected, which is understandable. However, cutting off communication entirely without explanation can be hurtful.\n\nThe author mentions that he didn't respond to her texts, just gave minimal replies. That's ghosting. Now, whether that's in the wrong depends on societal norms and expectations. Some might argue that if you're not interested in pursuing a relationship, it's better to be upfront rather than ghost. Others might say that since the person was clear about their boundaries, the author is free to disengage.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest and didn't want to spend more money on dates if there's no chance of intimacy. But that's his personal preference. However, it's important to respect others' boundaries and not make assumptions. The fact that he was planning on intimacy on the first date might be a bit presumptuous, especially if he wasn't sure about her feelings. But the user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe there's more to consider.\n\nI should also think about the communication aspect. The author didn't explain his feelings to her, which could have been kinder. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and feeling rejected, which isn't nice but might not be considered \"wrong\" in a moral sense. It's more about personal responsibility and communication.\n\nIn summary, while ghosting is generally frowned upon, the author's actions are a result of losing interest after being rejected. The key point is whether he's being respectful. By not communicating his disinterest, he's being inconsiderate, which might make him the asshole. But if the user's perspective is that he's not in the wrong, there's a balance. I'm leaning towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because ghosting is inconsiderate regardless of the reason.\n"
