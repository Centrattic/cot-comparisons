We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that he ghosted Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. He thought she had a crush on him for months, asked her directly after the first date, and when she said no, he lost interest.\n\nFirst, I need to unpack the key points here. The author approached Casey, who he thought had feelings for him, and asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She declined and said she wants things to develop. He then ghosted her, not responding beyond minimal replies. He justifies this by saying he lost interest because he didn't get what he wanted on the first date and doesn't want to invest more time or money without a guaranteed outcome. \n\nNow, considering social norms and ethical behavior, is ghosting acceptable here? Well, consent is a big part. He didn't pressure her, but he was upfront. The problem is that he didn't respect her boundaries. She made it clear she wasn't interested in that physical step yet, and he decided to cut her off entirely. That seems harsh. \n\nCommunication is another angle. He didn't express his expectations clearly, perhaps. He assumed she would be okay with his approach, but she had different expectations. Ghosting after that might be seen as dismissive and not considering her feelings. Even if he lost interest, ending the interaction so abruptly without explanation could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the idea that he wasted money and time is a bit selfish. Relationships aren't transactions, and expecting immediate reciprocation in that way is unrealistic. She might have valid reasons for not wanting to rush into a physical relationship. His reaction of ghosting doesn't show empathy towards her perspective. \n\nHowever, he's being honest about his intentions. He's not pretending to be interested if he isn't. But the method of cutting off communication is where the issue lies. People have different timelines for intimacy, and respecting that is part of being considerate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while his feelings are valid, the way he handled the situation isn't. Ghosting isn't a considerate approach, regardless of the reason. It's important to communicate openly and respectfully when someone's not interested in continuing, rather than just disappearing. So the author might be in the wrong for not handling the rejection maturely and for not respecting her decision without cutting her off entirely. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
