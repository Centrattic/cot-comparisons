We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The question is whether the author's actions make them the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Casey have been flirting for two months, with rumors of mutual interest. They go on a first date, which includes dinner, a movie, and other typical activities. The author, being direct, asks if they can go back to his place to \"fool around.\" Casey says no, not tonight, and mentions wanting to let things develop. The author then loses interest, stops responding, and avoids her, only giving minimal responses when she texts.\n\nThe key points here are the author's expectations versus Casey's actions. He approached her with the intention of physical intimacy on the first date, which she declined. He claims he thought it was a given because she had a crush on him. However, she set a boundary, which he didn't respect. Ghosting after that is the issue.\n\nIn many cultures, it's considered respectful to honor someone's boundaries, even if it's not what you wanted. The author's reaction of cutting off communication because his expectations weren't met seems dismissive. He also mentions the financial aspect as a factor, which complicates things. Prioritizing his spending over her feelings might indicate a lack of emotional consideration.\n\nAdditionally, the author's honesty is cited as a virtue, but being honest shouldn't justify treating someone poorly. Communication is key in relationships, and ghosting is a form of communication that's generally seen as inconsiderate. The author didn't explain his feelings or discuss why he was pulling away, which could have led to a more respectful resolution.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision, didn't communicate his feelings properly, and ghosted her instead of having a conversation. His actions are disrespectful and hurtful, especially since he admitted to losing interest without addressing the situation maturely.\n"
