We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no to fooling around on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted, and he's upset about the money spent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. Even if the person is upset, disappearing is considered inconsiderate. The author didn't respond to her texts, which Casey sent to check on him and suggest going out again. That's a key point\u2014ignoring follow-up attempts to communicate, even if the person is upset, is usually frowned upon.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of consent and respect. The author approached Casey directly about his intentions, which is honest, but when she said no, his response was to disengage completely. While he's allowed to have his own expectations, respecting her boundaries is crucial. Disrespecting those boundaries by ghosting could be seen as the real issue here. Instead of being upfront about his needs or discussing them, he cut her off, which might be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to invest more time or money without the immediate payoff he wanted. That's his personal preference, but that doesn't excuse not being honest with her about his expectations. If he needed a certain level of physical intimacy to be interested, he should have communicated that from the start. Assuming she'd agree to his terms after a first date, then getting upset when she didn't, seems a bit self-centered.\n\nOn the other hand, Casey did say she liked him and wanted to take things slower. The author's decision to ghost might be his choice, but the consideration here is about the impact on her. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, which is why it's often criticized. Even if the author isn't \"wrong\" in the legal sense, socially, it's seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions were disrespectful to Casey's boundaries and her attempts to maintain communication. Ghosting is typically viewed as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
