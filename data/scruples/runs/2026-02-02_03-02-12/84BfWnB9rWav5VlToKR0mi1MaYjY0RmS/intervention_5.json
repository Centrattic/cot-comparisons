We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author wanted to have sex, but Casey said no, and he lost interest, so he stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key points here. The author approached the date with the intention of having sex, which he made clear early on. Casey said no, and he took it personally, losing interest. The main question is whether ghosting her is justified here.\n\nFrom a social norms perspective, pressuring someone for sex on a first date is generally considered inappropriate. The author was honest about his intentions, but that doesn't necessarily make it okay. Respect for boundaries is crucial in relationships. If someone says no, the appropriate response is to respect that decision, not to cut them off.\n\nGhosting is usually seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Casey might have had valid reasons for saying no, and she still reached out afterward. The author's decision to ghost her instead of having a mature conversation could be seen as avoiding responsibility for his actions or being disrespectful.\n\nThe argument that the author isn't in the wrong is that he was honest and lost interest when his expectations weren't met. However, the other side is that he didn't consider her feelings or boundaries, and ghosting is a poor way to handle rejection. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were respectful. By ghosting, he's not showing respect for her autonomy or her decision. Even if he's not interested anymore, a better approach would have been to have an open conversation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and for ghosting instead of addressing the situation maturely.\n"
