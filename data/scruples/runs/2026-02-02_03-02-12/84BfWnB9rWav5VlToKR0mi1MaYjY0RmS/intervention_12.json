We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author was clear that they wanted to fool around, the girl said no and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about consent, respect, and expectations. The author approached the situation by being very direct about their intentions right after a first date. The girl, on the other hand, expressed that she wanted to take it slow and let things develop. The author then decided to lose interest and ghost her because they didn't get what they wanted.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, when someone sets boundaries (like not wanting to have sex yet), the appropriate response is to respect those boundaries. The author didn't respect the girl's decision and instead cut off communication, which is considered ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as hurtful and disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they lost interest because the girl didn't \"put out,\" which is a problematic attitude. It suggests that the author's interest was conditional on sexual activity, which can be seen as objectifying the other person. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and emotional connection, not on conditional expectations for physical intimacy.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions the money spent on the date as a factor. Valuing a person based on financial investment can be a red flag. It's important to consider the emotional and personal aspects rather than transactional ones.\n\nWhile the user might argue that the author was honest about their intentions, the follow-up action of ghosting after the rejection is where the issue lies. It's acceptable to be honest about one's desires, but it's not acceptable to disregard the other person's boundaries and then cut them off without explanation.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions were disrespectful and dismissive of the girl's autonomy. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
