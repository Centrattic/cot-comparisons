We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the person went on a first date with Casey. They were flirting for a while, and there were rumors she had a crush on him. During the date, he asked her if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just ghosting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered acceptable behavior. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is doing that because she didn't have sex with him on the first date. He mentions that he thought he had a \"done deal\" because she had a crush on him. That seems like an assumption on his part. He approached the date with the expectation of physical intimacy, and when it didn't happen, he lost all interest and stopped responding.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost someone for not meeting your expectations? Well, communication is key in relationships. He asked her directly, and she declined. Instead of having a conversation about his expectations or why he's disappointed, he just cuts her off. That's pretty harsh. Also, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent on the date as a reason not to pursue her again seems a bit self-centered. The value of a date shouldn't be measured in money, especially since she didn't ask for anything in return.\n\nHe also mentions that she's reached out to him after, and he's not responding. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. Even if he's not interested anymore, a simple explanation would be better. His reasoning for ghosting is based on his own expectations not being met, which might be his own issue. Maybe he wasn't clear about his intentions earlier, or he's not respecting her boundaries by expecting physical intimacy so quickly.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author is acting on his own disappointment and not respecting her decision to take things slow. Ghosting is seen as inconsiderate, and his actions are based on his own expectations rather than mutual respect. Therefore, he's in the wrong here.\n"
