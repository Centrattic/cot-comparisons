We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he asked Casey to \"fool around\" on their first date, which was after knowing each other for 8 months and flirting for 2. She said no, and he lost interest, so he's been ghosting her. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he was honest about wanting to have sex and thought she had a crush on him for months. When she said no, he felt like he \"struck out,\" which is a common expression for not getting what he wanted. He felt it was a waste of money and lost interest. \n\nFrom Casey's side, she might feel hurt or confused because she said she liked him and wanted to take things slower. She's been reaching out, which shows she's interested in maintaining the relationship or at least being polite. Ghosting after one date, especially just because she didn't comply with his wishes, seems abrupt and maybe disrespectful. \n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. It's generally considered respectful to communicate openly if you're not interested in continuing a relationship. Ghosting can be seen as rude because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. The author's actions might be seen as dismissive, especially since Casey expressed interest in continuing. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for losing interest is based on his own expectations. If someone's okay with taking things slower, they might value communication and mutual respect over immediate intimacy. The fact that he felt it was a \"waste of money\" could be a selfish perspective, as dating involves shared expenses and mutual investment.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different boundaries and expectations. If the author was upfront, he might not be in the wrong for not pursuing a relationship that doesn't meet his needs. However, the way he handled the aftermath\u2014ghosting instead of a direct conversation\u2014might be where he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the key issue is whether ghosting is acceptable. Since the author's problem is personal (not getting what he wanted), but the action of ghosting affects Casey negatively, it's likely that he's in the wrong for not being upfront about ending things and for not respecting her overtures to continue communication.\n"
