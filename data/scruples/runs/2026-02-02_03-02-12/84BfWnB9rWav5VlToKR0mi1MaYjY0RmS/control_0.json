We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting after the girl didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey had known each other for 8 months, with some flirting and rumors she had a crush. Their first date was dinner and a movie. The author asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" which she declined, saying they should wait until the second date. He felt disappointed, zoned out, and after the date, he hasn't responded much, giving only minimal replies. He's justifying it by saying he lost interest and doesn't want to invest more time/money without getting what he wanted. The question is if he's wrong for doing this.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships and communication norms. One perspective is that the author was upfront, but she clearly stated she wasn't interested in that level of intimacy yet. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. The author's motivation is about his own physical gratification, which might be seen as transactional. He's prioritizing his own needs without respecting her boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that if he wasn't interested in pursuing a non-sexual relationship, then he's not obligated to continue. But the act of ghosting is usually frowned upon regardless. Also, the fact that he was honest about his expectations but then became disinterested when she didn't comply could mean he's being inconsiderate of her feelings and the effort she put into the date.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might be seen as treating the relationship as a means to an end (sex), and when that wasn't met, he's cutting her off. That's disrespectful because it doesn't value her autonomy. Also, the financial aspect (\"spent a fair bit of change\") is a bit of an excuse, as it's his choice to spend money on dates, and expecting a return on investment in that context is problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being upfront is good, but following through with rejection by ghosting is bad. There's a difference between losing interest and ghosting. He could have communicated his feelings instead of cutting her off. His justification (\"I don't see the point\") is self-centered because it doesn't take her feelings into account.\n\nTherefore, the consensus would likely be that he's in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
