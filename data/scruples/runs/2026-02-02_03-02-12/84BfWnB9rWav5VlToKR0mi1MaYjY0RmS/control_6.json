We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author mentions that they were direct about wanting to fool around, and when the girl said no, he lost interest and stopped responding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author felt disinterested, cutting off communication completely might be harsh. The girl indicated she wanted to take things slower, which the author didn't respect.\n\nThen, the author's reasoning is that he lost all interest because she didn't comply. But that could be problematic. Wanting a relationship to be based on mutual respect and consent is important. If someone only wants a relationship if the other person is willing to have sex on the first date, that's not a healthy dynamic. Respecting someone's boundaries, even if it doesn't meet your expectations, is key in any relationship.\n\nAlso, the author brings up the cost of the date, which might indicate he viewed the interaction more transactionally. Valuing someone's company as a \"fair bit of change\" spent on a date could be a red flag. Relationships shouldn't be based on financial investment expecting a certain outcome.\n\nGhosting is generally frowned upon regardless of the reason. People might argue that if you don't want to talk to someone, you should at least explain why, even if it's not to hurt their feelings. The author's actions could hurt the other person by making her feel rejected without understanding why.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his feelings. If he's not interested in continuing the relationship because his expectations weren't met, maybe he's not wrong to end it. But the method of ending it\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the issue lies. There's a difference between not wanting to pursue a relationship and ghosting someone, which is more about communication.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. He didn't communicate his feelings and instead cut off contact, which is disrespectful. Even if he lost interest, the way he handled it is where he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
