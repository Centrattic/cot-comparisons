We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is wrong. So, the situation is that they went on a first date with Casey, asked her if they could go back to his place to fool around, and she said no. Then he lost interest and started ghosting her. The guy's reasoning is that he didn't want to spend more money on dates if there's no sexual activity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect. When someone says no, especially about something as personal as sex, it's important to respect their boundaries. The guy was honest, but then got upset when she didn't comply. That might not be the best approach. He seems to have been looking for a yes, and when she said no, he didn't handle it well. Ghosting after that could be seen as dismissive and not respectful of her feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's focusing on the money he spent might not be the right perspective. It's not about the cost but whether the relationship is mutual. If she's interested in building a relationship without immediate sex, that's her right. The guy's loss of interest because of her boundaries could indicate he wasn't interested in a real relationship but rather a physical one. That's a problem because healthy relationships require mutual respect and understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his choice to not want to pursue a relationship without sex. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and being cold\u2014could be considered harsh. He could have communicated his feelings instead of cutting her off, even if he felt disappointed. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and hurt.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy's actions of ghosting after she said no might be wrong because it lacks communication and respect for her decision. Even if his intentions were honest, the way he responded was disrespectful. Therefore, he might be the asshole for not handling the rejection maturely.\n"
