We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused his advances on the first date. The author expected a \"yes\" to fooling around after months of flirting, but she said \"no, not tonight\" and suggested giving it a second date. He then lost interest, didn't respond to her texts, and now wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations around dating. In many cultures, there's an unspoken rule that pressuring someone for physical intimacy too soon can be off-putting. Ghosting, or cutting off communication without explanation, is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reason. The author's actions were to stop responding to her messages, which can leave the other person confused and hurt.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest after she didn't comply with his expectations. However, the responsibility here might lie in how he approached the situation. By being blunt and expecting a certain outcome, he might have set unrealistic expectations. If Casey was clear about wanting to take things slower, his reaction of disengaging without communication could be seen as self-centered. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was focused on the cost of the date rather than the relationship's value might indicate a transactional attitude, which can be problematic. While it's his prerogative to not pursue a relationship, the way he's handling the aftermath by ghosting is where the issue lies. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did communicate his intentions upfront, so Casey might have been aware of his expectations. However, it's still his responsibility to respect her boundaries and manage his own expectations. Ghosting isn't a respectful way to end the interaction, regardless of his feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's disappointment is understandable, ghosting is typically considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A, as he's not respecting her decision and is avoiding communication, which is the wrong approach.\n"
