We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The situation is presented in the AITA format, where the author is justifying their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for five to six months. They went on a first date, and the author asked directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and said she wanted things to develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether ghosting someone for not meeting sexual expectations on a first date is wrong. Let's break down the perspectives. From the author's side, they felt they had a \"done deal\" based on prior flirtation and rumors, so when she said no, they lost interest. They mention feeling like they wasted money and not wanting to invest more time without the sexual aspect. \n\nFrom Casey's perspective, she declined his proposition, which is her right. She might have been interested in building a relationship and didn't want to rush into a physical relationship. The author's response of ghosting could be seen as dismissive and rude, especially since she tried to communicate further after the date, but he ignored her.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics. Ghosting is generally considered poor form because it cuts off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. Even if the author felt rejected, cutting off contact without addressing the situation is inconsiderate. The fact that Casey continued to reach out and he didn't respond shows a lack of respect for her attempts to maintain contact.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning is based on his own expectations of what the relationship should be, which might not align with her boundaries or values. Expecting someone to have sex on the first date might not be realistic or respectful of her personal standards. The author's decision to withdraw after a rejection could be seen as treating her as a means to an end rather than valuing her as a person.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is within his rights to disinterest if his expectations aren't met, especially if he's honest about his desires. The problem arises in how he handles the disinterest\u2014ghosting versus communicating clearly. \n\nBut in most social contexts, being honest and respectful about one's needs is better than ghosting. The author didn't communicate his disinterest clearly; instead, he ignored her messages. That's where the issue lies. Even if he's not obligated to pursue a relationship with someone who doesn't meet his expectations, cutting off all contact without explanation is considered unkind and inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are inconsiderate and lack respect for Casey's boundaries and her attempts to maintain communication. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
