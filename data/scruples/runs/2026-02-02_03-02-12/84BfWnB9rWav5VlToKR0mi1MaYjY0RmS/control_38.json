We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nSo the situation is that the author asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" expecting a yes because there were rumors she had a crush on him. But she said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest and hasn't responded to her texts, essentially ghosting her. He mentions that he's not doing it to hurt her but because he lost interest after spending money on the date and doesn't want to risk another rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The author's reasoning is that he's not interested anymore, but the way he handled it is abrupt. \n\nCasey set a boundary by not wanting to engage in sexual activity on the first date. The author, however, had expectations based on rumors and his own assumptions. When those expectations weren't met, he decided to cut off communication. But is that acceptable?\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author could have discussed his feelings about the rejection instead of just disappearing. By not responding, he's leaving Casey confused and hurt. Even if he's not interested anymore, a respectful conversation would be better than ghosting.\n\nAlso, the author mentions spending money on the date. However, that shouldn't be a factor in how he treats her. Expecting sex in exchange for a date is a problematic mindset. Healthy relationships aren't transactional like that. The fact that he feels like he \"wasted money\" suggests he viewed the date as an investment for personal gain, which isn't healthy.\n\nMoreover, he acknowledges that she's interested and wants to continue, but he's cutting her off because she didn't meet his physical expectations. That shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and her feelings. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude, regardless of the reason. Even if someone loses interest, being honest and kind is better. So the author's actions are inconsiderate, and he's in the wrong for not handling the situation respectfully.\n"
