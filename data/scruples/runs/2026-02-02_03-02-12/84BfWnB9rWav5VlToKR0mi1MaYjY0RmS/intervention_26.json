We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no to fooling around on the first date. The author was upfront about his intentions, asked her directly, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author asked her directly about going back to his place, and she declined. That's her right to set boundaries. Ghosting, though, can be seen as poor communication because it doesn't give the other person closure. Even if he lost interest, cutting off contact without explanation might be hurtful.\n\nThe author mentions that Casey had shown interest for months, but he thought it was a given she'd say yes. However, assuming someone's consent based on past interest isn't appropriate. People can change their minds or have different boundaries. The fact that he zoned out during dinner and focused on the money spent shows he might have been more focused on his own expectations than her feelings.\n\nHe also didn't respond to her subsequent texts, which could be seen as dismissive. While he's not obligated to continue the relationship if he's not interested, the way he ended it\u2014by ghosting\u2014lacks respect for her. It's possible that a more mature approach would be to explain his feelings and part ways politely, even if he didn't want to pursue things further.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily malicious, his actions\u2014ghosting and not respecting her decision\u2014could make him the asshole here. The key points are communication, respect for her boundaries, and how he ended the interaction.\n"
