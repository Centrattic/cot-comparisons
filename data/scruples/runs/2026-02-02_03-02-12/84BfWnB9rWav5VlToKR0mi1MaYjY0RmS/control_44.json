We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone because she didn't have sex on the first date. The author setup a first date, asked her to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author approached the girl, was direct about wanting to fool around. She said no and suggested they take it slower. He then lost interest. The key points here are consent, respect, and consideration.\n\nIn relationships or dating, respecting a person's boundaries is crucial. The girl said no, which means the author should respect that decision. However, the issue here isn't about whether the girl was wrong to say no, but whether the author's reaction (ghosting) was appropriate. Ghosting someone after they set a boundary could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. Even if the author lost interest, cutting off communication abruptly without explanation can be considered inconsiderate.\n\nThe author mentions that he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions still cause harm. People have the right to change their minds or set limits, and the response should be respectful regardless of personal feelings. The author's focus on the money spent on the date might also indicate a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy. Expecting a certain outcome from a date, especially in terms of physical intimacy, and then cutting someone off when that doesn't happen can be seen as shallow and disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his feelings. He felt disinterested after the rejection, which is a personal emotion. However, acting on that by ghosting is where the problem lies. Communication is key in dating; instead of ghosting, he could have explained his feelings, even if it's to say he's not interested moving forward. Ghosting lacks accountability and can leave the other person confused and hurt.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful. He didn't communicate his disinterest properly and instead chose to disappear, which is typically seen as the asshole move. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
