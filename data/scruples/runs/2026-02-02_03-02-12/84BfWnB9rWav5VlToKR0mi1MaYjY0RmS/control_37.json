We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting after the first date when the woman said no.\n\nFirst, the author went on a date with Casey, asked her directly if she wanted to go back to his place, and she declined. He felt disappointed and lost interest, so he stopped responding. He's justifying it by saying he didn't want to invest more money and time if there's no chance of a physical relationship. \n\nNow, considering social norms and respect in relationships. Ghosting someone after they set a boundary is generally seen as rude. The woman made a choice to say no, which is her right. The author's response of cutting off communication because she didn't meet his expectations could be viewed as dismissive and disrespectful. He's prioritizing his own desires over her autonomy and the potential for a respectful relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he's \"not doing this to hurt her,\" but that doesn't excuse the behavior. Respecting someone's decision, even if it's not what you wanted, is important. The fact that he's ignoring her texts shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nFinancial reasons shouldn't be a factor in treating someone with respect. The money spent on the date isn't a valid justification for ghosting. Relationships should be based on mutual respect, not transactional expectations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful. He's in the wrong by not respecting her decision and cutting her off without communication.\n"
