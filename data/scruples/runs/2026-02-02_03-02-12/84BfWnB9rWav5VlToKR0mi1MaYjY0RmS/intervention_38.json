We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted, and he's not interested in continuing to invest time and money without that outcome. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting generally refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. In this case, the author isn't responding to her texts and avoiding her. He feels justified because he lost interest, but is that a valid reason?\n\nThe author's approach was to ask bluntly about fooling around on the first date. That might have been too direct, especially if Casey wanted to take things slower. When she said no, he zoned out and then ghosted her. His main issue is her not meeting his expectations, which he thought were met because he thought she had a crush on him. But maybe he misread her interest. \n\nFrom a social perspective, expecting physical intimacy on the first date might be a bit presumptuous. Casey clearly set a boundary by saying \"not tonight\" and wanting things to develop. The author's reaction was to lose all interest, which could be seen as dismissive of her boundaries and feelings. \n\nGhosting is often considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if the author isn't interested anymore, a simple explanation might be kinder. However, he argues that he's not trying to hurt her. But the impact of his actions is still there. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he respected her decision to not go further that night, but then chose to ghost. While it's his choice to disengage, the lack of communication could be seen as inconsiderate. However, some might say that if he's not interested in continuing, he's within his rights. But the fact that he spent money and then cut her off might be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for ghosting, even if his reasoning is about losing interest. The key ethical point is about treating others with respect, even when the relationship isn't working out. So I might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. But there's ambiguity because people do have different standards for relationships.\n"
