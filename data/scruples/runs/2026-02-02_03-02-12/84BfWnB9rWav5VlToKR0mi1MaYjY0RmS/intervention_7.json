We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author approached Casey directly about fooling around, expecting a yes because of the rumors and their flirting. When she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating. He felt like she was an \"easy sell,\" which turned out not to be the case. Now he's ghosting her because he's not interested in pursuing further dates without the possibility of intimacy.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author is honest about his reasons, cutting off communication completely after a first date where expectations weren't met might be harsh. However, some might argue that if the relationship was conditional on immediate physical intimacy, then it's the author's prerogative to disengage when that condition isn't met. But typically, relationships require mutual effort and understanding. The author's reaction to the rejection by withdrawing communication could be seen as dismissive of Casey's feelings and her expressed interest in continuing the relationship. \n\nHe also mentions the financial aspect, but that shouldn't be the main factor. The main issue here is the lack of follow-up communication. Instead of being honest about his feelings, he's ghosting, which is a passive-aggressive way to handle rejection. Even if he's honest with himself, he's not being honest with her. \n\nSo, considering that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings properly and left Casey in the dark after she was trying to reach out. Ghosting is generally frowned upon regardless of the reason. The fact that he lost interest is his choice, but not communicating that is where the issue lies.\n"
