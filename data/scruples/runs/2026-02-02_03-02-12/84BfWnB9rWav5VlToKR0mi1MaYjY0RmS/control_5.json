We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The author expected a casual encounter, but Casey wanted to take things slower. He's now cutting off communication because he lost interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and relationship dynamics. Ghosting someone for not meeting sexual expectations can be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. People have different boundaries and timelines, and respecting that is important. The author's reaction seems to prioritize his own physical desires over her comfort and consent, which might be problematic.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect he mentions is a personal gripe but shouldn't justify ghosting. Relationships shouldn't be transactional. By not communicating and just disappearing, he's not being honest about his feelings. A mature approach would be to explain his feelings without making her feel bad, even if he's disappointed.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is honest about his intentions and that he's not pretending to want a relationship when he doesn't. But the key issue here is the lack of communication and the abruptness of ghosting. Even if he lost interest, an open conversation would be better than ignoring her.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are hurtful and disrespectful, making him the asshole. The answer should be A.\n"
