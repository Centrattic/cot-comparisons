We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this \"Am I the asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex with him on the first date. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user says he's known Casey for 8 months and they've been flirting for about 2. Rumors suggest she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. Their first date involved a movie and dinner, which are typical. Then he asks her bluntly if she wants to go back to his place to fool around. She says \"no, not tonight\" and mentions that she's not \"like that,\" wanting to let things develop on the second date. \n\nHe admits he thought it was an easy sell, but when she declined, he lost interest. He didn't respond to her after that, zoned out during the date, and after saying goodbye, he hasn't replied much since. He just gives her thumbs up or \"k\" when she texts him, and he's considering himself justified because he spent money on the date and doesn't want to risk another one where she might not be interested. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, ghosting someone because they didn't agree to sex on the first date is problematic. The user's main issue is that he was focused on a physical outcome, and when that didn't happen, he disengaged. This can be seen as objectifying the person, valuing the relationship more for the potential physical connection than for getting to know her. \n\nRespecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Casey set a clear boundary by declining the offer, and instead of respecting her decision and building the relationship, the user lost interest. That's not treating her as a person with her own pace and values. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused without closure. \n\nThe user's justification about the money spent is a bit shallow. While it's understandable to feel disappointment, reducing a relationship to a transaction isn't healthy. Also, the fact that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" might indicate he didn't take her feelings or the relationship seriously enough in the first place. \n\nSo, the user acted inconsiderately by ghosting Casey after her refusal, and he didn't respect her desire to take things slower. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong. Answer A makes sense here.\n"
