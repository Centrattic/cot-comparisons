We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they ghosted someone named Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author explains that he thought she had a crush on him for months, asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author approached Casey with a direct question about having sex on the first date, expecting a positive response because of the rumors and their prior flirting. When she declined, he felt disappointed, didn't respond to her texts, and now is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's wrong to ghost someone after they refuse sexual advances on the first date. Let's break down the factors. \n\nCommunication: The author was upfront about his intentions, which is good. However, Casey was clear that she wasn't interested in that level of physical involvement yet and wanted to take things slower. The problem arises when the author didn't respect her boundaries and decided to cut off communication. Ghosting is generally seen as disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nEmotional response: The author's reaction seems to be more about his own expectations not being met rather than respecting Casey's decision. He mentions feeling like he \"struck out\" and thinking about the money spent on the date. This shows that his priorities were more about getting what he wanted rather than valuing the relationship's development. \n\nRespect and maturity: In a healthy relationship, both parties need to respect each other's boundaries. The author's lack of response to her follow-up messages indicates a lack of consideration for her feelings. Even if he lost interest, a mature response would be to explain his feelings instead of disappearing.\n\nFinancial aspect: While he mentions the money spent, it's important to note that expecting physical intimacy in exchange for money is transactional and not a healthy basis for a relationship. His focus on the cost suggests a lack of genuine interest in building a connection.\n\nSocial norms: Societally, there's a growing emphasis on consent and mutual respect. The author's actions, while maybe not illegal, are socially frowned upon because they disregard Casey's wishes and don't maintain open communication.\n\nPossible defenses: The user might argue that the author was honest about his intentions and that Casey should have known his expectations. However, even if both parties are honest, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. The author's decision to ghost doesn't align with respectful behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions of ghosting after Casey refused his advances, not responding to her messages, and prioritizing his own desires over her clear boundaries make him the asshole in this situation. The answer should be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
