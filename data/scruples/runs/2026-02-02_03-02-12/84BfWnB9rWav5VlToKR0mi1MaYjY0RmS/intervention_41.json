We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no on the first date. The author is a guy who had been flirting with Casey for a couple of months, and she had rumors of having a crush on him. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. He asked her directly if she wanted to go back to his place, expecting a yes because he thought she had been into him. She declined, saying they should take things slower and that she liked him. He then zoned out during the rest of the date, and after that, he stopped communicating, only responding minimally to her texts. He admits to losing interest because she didn't sleep with him and he felt like he wasted money.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was pushy about physical intimacy on a first date, didn't respect her boundaries when she said no, and then ghosted her. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is whether he is. \n\nFrom a societal or ethical standpoint, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if someone is interested in you, pressuring them for sex on the first date is not okay. Casey clearly said no and suggested taking things slower, which is a reasonable request. By not respecting her decision and then cutting off communication, the author is being dismissive and not treating her with respect. Ghosting is generally considered bad form because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. The author's reasoning\u2014that he lost interest because she didn't sleep with him\u2014shows a lack of respect for her and her values. It's also a bit entitlement thinking that if someone likes you, they should reciprocate physical intimacy when asked. Additionally, the mention of money wasted is a bit selfish and not a valid reason to ghost someone. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions don't come from a place of respect. He didn't consider Casey's feelings or her desire to take things slowly. He prioritized his own needs and feelings over hers, which makes him the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
