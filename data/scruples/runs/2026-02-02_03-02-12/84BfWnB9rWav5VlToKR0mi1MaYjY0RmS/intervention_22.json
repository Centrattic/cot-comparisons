We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no to fooling around on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost all interest because she didn't give him what he wanted, and he's not interested in continuing the relationship beyond that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Even if someone has a justification, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. The author didn't communicate his feelings directly; instead, he just stopped responding. That's a red flag.\n\nNext, the author's approach to the situation: he asked bluntly if she wanted to \"fool around,\" which might have been too direct. He expected a \"yes\" because of the rumors and her supposed crush, but she wanted to take things slower. His reaction was to lose interest and ghost her. This shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and his own immaturity in handling rejection.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the cost of the date. While money can be a factor, it's not a valid reason to ghost someone. Relationships shouldn't be transactional like that. His focus on the financial aspect over her feelings indicates a poor attitude.\n\nHowever, some might argue that everyone has different expectations. If the author was clear about his intentions and she didn't meet them, maybe he's not wrong to disengage. But the key issue here is communication. He didn't talk it out and just disappeared, which is where the problem lies.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions stem from his own expectations being unmet, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting without explanation\u2014is inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
