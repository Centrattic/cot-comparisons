We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user met Casey eight months ago, and there was flirting for two months. Rumors suggest she had feelings for him for about five to six months. They went on a first date, did typical date things, and the user bluntly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" He thought it was a done deal, but she said no, not tonight. She mentioned she's not like that and wanted to let things develop on a second date, saying she liked him. \n\nThen, the user zoned out during the rest of the date, focused on the fact that he \"struck out\" and the money he spent. Afterward, he didn't respond to her texts, just minimal replies. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole for ghosting her because she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user had expectations of physical intimacy early on, which Casey didn't meet. He took it very personally, lost interest, and ghosted her, possibly because of financial reasons. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. From a general social perspective, people have different boundaries and expectations. The user was upfront, but assuming that because she had a crush on him, she would be okay with immediate physical intimacy seems problematic. It's common for people to want to build a connection first. Ghosting someone because they didn't meet his sexual expectations is dismissive and disrespectful. It's important to respect others' boundaries, even if they don't align with your desires. The fact that he's only focusing on the money and losing interest after one rejection suggests a lack of genuine interest in the relationship beyond what he wanted. Ghosting without communication is generally considered inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. So, the user is likely in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and for ending communication without addressing the issue properly. The answer is probably A.\n"
