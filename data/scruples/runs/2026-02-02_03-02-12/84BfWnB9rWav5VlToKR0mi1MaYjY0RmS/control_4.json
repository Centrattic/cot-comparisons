We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a first date with Casey, and after a movie and dinner, he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She declined, saying she wasn't ready and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now just isn't replying to her texts.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, ghosting someone because they didn't comply with your expectations of physical intimacy can be problematic. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and communication, not just on what one person wants. The author's approach was to be blunt about his intentions upfront, which might have been too forward, especially if he wasn't prepared for her to say no. \n\nGhosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author felt disappointed, cutting off communication entirely without explanation can hurt the other person. The fact that Casey made it clear she wanted to take things slowly and still showed interest by reaching out afterward suggests she valued the connection. The author's decision to ghost based on her declining his advances could be seen as dismissive of her boundaries and feelings.\n\nMoreover, using financial reasons (\"spent a fair bit of change\") as justification for losing interest is a bit shallow. The cost of the date shouldn't be the determining factor in whether to continue a relationship. Respecting someone's autonomy and consent is more important than any monetary investment.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is honest about his intentions and that if physical intimacy was a deal-breaker for him from the start, then he wasn't being dishonest. But the key issue here is how he handled the rejection. Instead of having an open conversation about his needs and expectations, he chose to withdraw completely, which isn't a mature or respectful response.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to hurt Casey, his actions of ghosting after her refusal lack the respect and communication necessary in healthy interactions. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong.\n"
