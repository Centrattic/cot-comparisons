We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she refused to have sex on the first date. The situation is presented in a \"Am I the Asshole?\" style, so I need to consider social norms and expectations.\n\nFirst, the author approached Casey on their first date and asked her directly if she wanted to go back to his place to fool around. She said no, emphasizing that she wanted things to develop. He then lost interest and stopped responding, which is ghosting. \n\nNow, considering societal views on relationships and consent: Pressuring someone for sex, especially on a first date, is generally seen as inappropriate. The author's decision to end the interaction because he didn't get what he wanted might be viewed as dismissive and disrespectful. Respect for others' boundaries is crucial. Ghosting after someone says no can be seen as rude and inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that he's honest and clear about his expectations and that he's not interested in pursuing a relationship without physical intimacy. But even so, cutting off communication abruptly without explanation isn't considered respectful. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: The author made the choice to ask for something that many people consider too soon, and then reacted poorly when it was declined. He's choosing to end the relationship because his expectations weren't met, which shifts the focus from mutual respect to his own needs. \n\nSo, the author's actions are problematic because he didn't respect her decision and ghosted her, which is a form of emotional harm. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
