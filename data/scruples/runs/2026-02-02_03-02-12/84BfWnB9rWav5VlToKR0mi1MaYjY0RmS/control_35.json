We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Casey have known each other for 8 months, been flirting for 2, and there were rumors about her feelings for 5-6 months. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author asked bluntly if they could go back to his place and have sex. She said no, not tonight, and mentioned she wants to take things slow. Then the author zoned out, didn't respond properly, and after the date, he lost interest and hasn't been replying. Now he's just giving thumbs up or \"k\" to her texts.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's okay to ghost someone because they didn't sleep with you on the first date. Ghosting means cutting all communication without explanation. The author claims he's not trying to hurt her, just lost interest because he's not into investing more time and money when there's a risk of not getting any physical intimacy.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, ghosting is generally considered rude, regardless of the reason. People might have different expectations, but even if the author had an expectation of physical intimacy early on, he should have communicated his feelings instead of disappearing. Casey was clear that she wanted to take it slow, and the author's reaction was to shut down the relationship. \n\nAlso, the author's justification is based on his own needs and the financial aspect. He mentions the cost of the date and not wanting to spend more. But that's a bit self-centered. A healthy relationship should consider mutual respect and communication. If he knew she wanted to wait, maybe he should have discussed whether they can still be together without that. Instead, he just ghosted her, which can be hurtful even if he wasn't the one who initiated the emotional connection.\n\nAdditionally, he was honest about his intentions, which is good, but honesty doesn't excuse ghosting. He should have had a conversation to explain his feelings and set boundaries if he wasn't okay with taking things slower. Leaving without closure can be very confusing and painful for the other person.\n\nSo, even though the author's actions are understandable from a personal desire perspective, the way he handled it is inconsiderate. He didn't communicate his disappointment or his need for physical intimacy upfront. Instead, he just stopped responding, which is the asshole move here. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
