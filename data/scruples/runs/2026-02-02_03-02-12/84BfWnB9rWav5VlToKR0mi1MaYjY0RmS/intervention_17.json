We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author admits he approached her directly about having sex, thought it was a given because she had a crush on him, but she said no. He then lost interest and stopped responding, even though she's tried to reach out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person without closure. But the author's reasoning is that he lost interest after being rejected. The problem here is that he was honest about his intentions upfront, but he also didn't communicate his feelings after the rejection. He stopped talking without explanation, which can hurt the other person. \n\nThe key points: He was honest upfront, but he didn't consider her perspective. She wanted to take things slower, and he took her rejection personally. The author's actions might be seen as dismissive and disrespectful, especially because he's using the rejection as a reason to cut her off completely without giving her a chance. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect is mentioned, which adds another layer. He's upset about the money spent, which isn't a valid reason to ghost someone. People date and sometimes it doesn't work out, and expenses are part of that. \n\nSo while the author's honesty is commendable, his response to her refusal is where the issue lies. Ghosting is generally inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. He could have communicated his feelings better instead of cutting off contact abruptly. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being respectful and communicative after the rejection.\n"
