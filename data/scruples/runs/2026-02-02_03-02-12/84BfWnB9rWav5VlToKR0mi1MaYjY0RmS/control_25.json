We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author was upfront about wanting to have sex, and when Casey said no and wanted to take things slower, he lost interest and stopped responding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations around dating. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Even if the author felt let down, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's only interested in a relationship where there's immediate physical intimacy. That's his personal preference, but it doesn't justify ghosting someone. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and communication. By being direct about his expectations and then ghosting when they weren't met, he's not handling the situation respectfully.\n\nCasey might have appreciated a more mature response, like explaining that his needs aren't met without being confrontational. Instead, he's treating her decision to say no as a personal failure, which is unfair. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, and respecting that is key. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and values.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect he mentions is a bit of a red herring. While it's understandable to feel it's a loss, it's not a valid reason to ghost someone. The focus should be on mutual respect rather than perceived value exchange.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author's actions stem from his own unmet expectations, ghosting is generally considered disrespectful. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
