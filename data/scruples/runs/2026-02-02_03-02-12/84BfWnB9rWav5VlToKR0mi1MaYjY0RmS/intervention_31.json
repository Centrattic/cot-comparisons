We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The guy, let's call him AITA author, had known Casey for 8 months, with flirting for 2 months. Rumors she had a crush on him for 5-6 months. First date was dinner and a movie. He asked bluntly if they could go back to his place to fool around, she said no, not tonight. He thought he had a deal because she had a crush. She said she wanted things to develop. He zoned out, felt awkward, and later ghosted her. He's not replying to her texts now because he lost interest. He mentions the money he spent on the date and not wanting to risk another date where she might say no again.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to assess both sides. \n\nFrom Casey's perspective, she didn't want to have sex on the first date and communicated that she wanted things to move at a slower pace. She's trying to maintain contact after the awkward end. Ghosting someone immediately after they set a boundary might be seen as dismissive. The author's reaction could be considered insensitive, especially if Casey was clear about her expectations and he wasn't respecting that.\n\nFrom the author's side, he felt rejected and lost interest. He might feel like the date was a waste of money and time since his main goal wasn't met. He's honest about his intentions upfront, which is fair, but then didn't handle the rejection gracefully. \n\nThe key points here are communication, respect for boundaries, and emotional maturity. While it's his right to not want to continue the relationship if her boundaries don't align with his desires, the way he ended it by ghosting could be seen as inconsiderate. People have different expectations, but cutting off communication without explanation might leave Casey feeling humiliated or unappreciated. \n\nThe author's justification is that he's honest and not trying to hurt her, but ghosting often causes more pain because it's abrupt and leaves no room for closure. Even if he lost interest, a respectful response would be to explain his feelings and part ways amicably, rather than ignoring her messages. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while understandable from his own perspective, might be seen as inconsiderate and dismissive of Casey's feelings. Therefore, he could be in the wrong.\n"
