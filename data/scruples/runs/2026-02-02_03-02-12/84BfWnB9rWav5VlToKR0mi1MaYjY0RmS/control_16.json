We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author's main reasoning is that they lost interest because their expectation wasn't met, and they're upset about the money spent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author is upset, cutting off communication abruptly can be hurtful. The person being ghosted, Casey, is making efforts to reach out with texts, which the author is ignoring. \n\nThen, the author's expectations play a role. They went into the date expecting physical intimacy, which Casey wasn't comfortable with. The author admitted they \"thought they had a done deal,\" which shows they might have assumed consent without it. Respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if the author is disappointed, that doesn't justify treating the other person poorly.\n\nThe mention of money spent is a red flag. Using financial loss as a reason to ghost someone is problematic because it prioritizes money over mutual respect. It's not about the cost but how they treated each other.\n\nCasey's response was to decline and suggest moving to a second date. The author didn't respond after that, which might indicate they were dismissive during the date. That could have been a sign they weren't respecting her wishes in the moment, leading to their current situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Ghosting is inconsiderate, not respecting boundaries by expecting sex without consent is an issue, and using money as a justification adds to the problem. The author's actions were hurtful and disrespectful. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
