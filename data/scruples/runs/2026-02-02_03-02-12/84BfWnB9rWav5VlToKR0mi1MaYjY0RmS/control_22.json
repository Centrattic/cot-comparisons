We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she declined his advances on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had known Casey for eight months and had been flirting for two. The first date was a movie and dinner. He asked her if they could go back to his place, and she said no, not tonight, saying she wasn't like that and wanted things to develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now just replies with minimal texts. He's justifying it by saying he lost interest and didn't want to waste money again if there's no sexual encounter.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether he's in the wrong. Ghosting is generally when someone cuts off all communication without explanation. Here, the author is ghosting Casey because she didn't have sex with him on the first date. The key points here are consent, mutual respect, and communication. \n\nCasey made it clear she wasn't interested in advancing things that night and wanted to take things slower. The author, instead of respecting her boundaries, decided to ghost her. Even though he says he's not trying to hurt her, the act of ghosting can be hurtful and is often seen as disrespectful. People have different expectations, but if someone isn't meeting yours, it's better to communicate that rather than cut them off abruptly. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the money is a bit problematic. It sounds like he's treating the relationship as a transactional thing, focusing on the cost rather than the mutual enjoyment. That's not a healthy approach. However, the core issue is the ghosting. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if he's lost interest, a better approach would be to explain why he's not interested in continuing. \n\nSo, the author's wrong is in ghosting without a clear explanation and not respecting the relationship's development as per Casey's wishes. He prioritized his own desires and then cut her off when she didn't comply. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
