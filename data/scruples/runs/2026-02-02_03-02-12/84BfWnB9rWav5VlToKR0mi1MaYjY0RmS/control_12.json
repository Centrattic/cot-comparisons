We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The story is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author and Casey knew each other for 8 months, flirted for 2, and there were rumors she had a crush. On their first date, he asked her if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no, not tonight, and suggested the second date. He lost interest and started ghosting her, responding only minimally to her texts. He admits to thinking about the money spent and losing interest because she didn't \"put out.\"\n\nNow, considering social norms. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, especially if done without explanation. The author was upfront about his intentions, which Casey didn't reciprocate. But he expected her to agree, which might be his mistake. Expecting someone to have sex on the first date isn't respectful of her boundaries. However, after she declined, he didn't engage in communication, which is dismissive.\n\nEthically, respecting someone's decision is key. The author's main issue is that he's treating her refusal as a deal-breaker and then punishing her by cutting off communication. That's not considerate. He should have communicated his feelings directly instead of ghosting. Even if he lost interest, a polite explanation would be better than ignoring her.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundaries properly and chose to ghost, which is hurtful. He also shouldn't have assumed consent based on her crush rumors. His focus on the money and the expectation of immediate sex are problematic. Proper communication and respect for her decision are what's missing here.\n"
