We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had been flirting with Casey for two months out of their eight-month acquaintance. Rumors suggested she liked him for five to six months. They went on a first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author directly asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said \"no, not tonight\" and emphasized she wasn't \"like that,\" wanting to take it slow. The author then zoned out during dinner, thinking about the money spent, and after the date ended, he lost interest, leading to ghosting.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's consider consent and communication. The author asked directly, and she said no. Respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Ghosting after a refusal could be seen as dismissive or not respecting her decision. On the other hand, the author felt disinterested after her refusal, which might affect his opinion. However, even if he's disinterested, ghosting can be hurtful and is generally considered poor communication. People have different expectations, but pressuring someone for physical intimacy on the first date isn't healthy. The author's focus on the financial aspect (\"money wasted\") might indicate a transactional view, which isn't respectful. So, while the author might feel justified, the act of ghosting after a clear no could be seen as inconsiderate. The right approach would be to communicate that he's not interested moving forward, even if it's not the answer he wanted. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the rejection respectfully by cutting off communication abruptly.\n"
