We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author mentions they've known her for 8 months, had been flirting for 2, and there were rumors of her having feelings for 5-6 months. The first date was movie and dinner, then he asked her to go to his place, which she declined. Now he's not responding much and just gives short replies.\n\nHmm. So, first, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about ghosting and the reason behind it. Ghosting is when someone suddenly cuts off all communication without explanation. The author says they lost interest after she said \"not tonight\" and are avoiding her texts, giving minimal responses. They justify it by saying they don't want to waste money again on a date that might not lead to what they wanted. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is whether they actually are. Let me consider the moral aspects. In relationships, honesty and communication are important. The author was direct and asked her if she wanted to go back to his place. She said no, but there were rumors she had a crush on him for months. The author might have misunderstood her intentions, assuming she was interested in physical relations when she was more focused on a slower, emotional build-up. \n\nNow, is it wrong to ghost someone for this reason? Well, expecting someone to have sex on the first date can be problematic. Not everyone is comfortable with that, and even if there were rumors, clear communication is key. The author's approach was blunt, and maybe Casey was looking for a more gradual development. Ghosting, in this case, might be seen as disrespectful because she's trying to reach out and the author is cutting her off without explaining why. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect. The author is upset about the money spent. However, treating the person as a \"fair bit of change\" and seeing the date as a transaction might be an issue. If the author's main interest was in having a sexual relationship, then perhaps they should have been clearer from the start. But if they thought there was mutual romantic interest, then expecting a quick progression might be a miscommunication. \n\nGhosting can leave the other person confused and hurt. Even if the author felt disinterested, a more respectful approach would be to communicate their feelings and not expect her to follow up if they're not interested. The fact that the author is avoiding her and not responding properly could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong. They ghosted Casey after a rejection, which is common in dating, but the problem is their reaction. Not replying to her texts and giving minimal responses isn't treating her with respect. The author should have either communicated their disinterest properly or not gone on the date if they were only looking for a physical relationship. The way they handled it is dismissive and could be hurtful, even if they're not malicious.\n"
