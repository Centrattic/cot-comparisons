We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author initiated a date, and during dinner, asked Casey if they could go back to his place. She declined, saying she wanted to take things slower. The author then became disinterested, zoned out for the rest of the date, and after returning home, stopped communicating with her, responding minimally to her texts. Now, he's justifying his actions by saying he lost all interest because she didn't meet his expectations for physical intimacy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's expectation of physical intimacy on the first date, Casey's refusal, and his subsequent ghosting. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, respect is crucial in relationships. The author approached Casey with a request, and she declined. Respecting her boundaries is important. By ghosting her, he's cutting off communication, which can be hurtful. Even if he felt disappointed, the appropriate response would be to have an honest conversation about his feelings and expectations, rather than abruptly ending contact.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions feeling like he wasted money, which adds a transactional aspect to the date. Viewing the date as an investment with an expected return (physical intimacy) is problematic. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and emotional connection, not transactional expectations.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Casey made it clear she wanted to take things slow, but the author's loss of interest and lack of communication could be seen as disrespectful to her boundaries and feelings. He's prioritizing his own desires over her comfort and the potential for a respectful, consensual relationship.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author has the right to his preferences and that he's not obligated to continue a relationship that doesn't meet his needs. However, the way he's handling it\u2014without communication\u2014neglects Casey's feelings and the mutual respect needed in any interaction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in terms of his personal preferences, his actions (ghosting and not communicating) are inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
