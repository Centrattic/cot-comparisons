We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user went on a first date with Casey. They were flirting for a while, and he asked her if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no and said she wanted to take things slower. Then the author lost interest and started ghosting her, not responding beyond brief messages.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent and respect. Asking someone to have sex is a big deal, and it's important to respect their boundaries. The author was upfront, which is good, but when Casey said no, he didn't push further, which is a positive point. However, the issue here is his reaction after the rejection. Ghosting her after she's clearly interested in continuing the relationship is problematic. The fact that she's texting him trying to reconnect shows she's interested, but he's cutting her off because she didn't comply with his desires. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't sleep with him on the first date. That's a bit selfish because building a relationship isn't just about physical intimacy. He also mentions the money spent on the date, which adds a transactional element to his feelings. That's not a healthy basis for a relationship either. \n\nNow, did he do something wrong? He didn't force her, so there's no assault or coercion. But ghosting someone after rejecting them can be hurtful. It's not illegal, but in terms of social ethics, it's seen as inconsiderate. The author's actions are causing emotional distress to Casey, even if he's not malicious. He's choosing not to engage because of his own unmet expectations. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, respecting someone's decision and then acting in a way that cuts them off just because they said no could be seen as wrong. Even if he's honest, the way he's ending communication is abrupt and dismissive. People have different standards, and it's okay to have them, but when you lose interest solely because someone didn't comply with your desires, that's a red flag. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's ghosting someone after rejection and not considering her feelings or the potential for a real relationship beyond physical aspects. His actions are disrespectful and lack empathy.\n"
