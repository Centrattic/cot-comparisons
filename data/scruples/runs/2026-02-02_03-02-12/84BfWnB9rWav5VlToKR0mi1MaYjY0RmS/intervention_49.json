We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author explains that they had been flirting for two months and there were rumors of a crush for five to six months. On their first date, he asked her bluntly if they should go back to his place, and she said no, not tonight. He felt like he had an \"easy sell\" but was disappointed when she said no. Now he's ghosting her because he lost interest, not wanting to invest more time or money without the chance of getting physical.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides here. The author's actions are based on his own expectations and disappointment. He admits he didn't respond to her after the awkward moment and later stopped communicating. On the other hand, Casey might feel hurt by being ghosted, especially since she reached out after the date. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered okay to have different boundaries in relationships. The author's approach of being direct was honest, but maybe he should have been prepared for her to say no. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate, even if the person is disappointed. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest, but communication would have been better than cutting off contact completely. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect is mentioned, but it's not about the money\u2014it's about mutual respect and respect for her boundaries. The key issue is whether it's right to ghost someone over not meeting one's sexual expectations. Since the author chose to end the conversation and communication abruptly, that's where he might be in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting is generally frowned upon, and there's a lack of consideration for the other person's feelings. Even if he felt disinterested, a respectful communication would be better than ghosting.\n"
