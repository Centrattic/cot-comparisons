We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who ghosted a woman named Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author was expecting it to happen because he thought she had a crush on him for months. They went on a date, he asked her to go back to his place, she said no and said they'd see on the second date. Then he lost interest and started ghosting her.\n\nHmm, so first, the author approached the date with the primary goal of getting physical, right? He was honest about wanting to fool around, which is his choice. But when she said no, he felt like it was a loss and stopped wanting to communicate. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off contact without explanation. Even if you lose interest, cutting someone off like that can be hurtful. \n\nCasey wanted to continue the relationship and had a different pace in mind. The author's decision to stop responding might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and preferences. He mentions not wanting to spend money again on a date where he might not get what he wants, which shows he was more focused on getting physical rather than building a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, he was honest about his intentions. But respecting someone's boundaries is important. If she clearly said she wasn't interested in that yet, the appropriate response would be to either accept that and continue dating or to part ways respectfully. Ghosting is not respectful because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. The author's main issue was expecting a certain outcome and not respecting her decision when she didn't meet his expectations. \n\nSo, even though he was honest, he didn't respect her boundaries and chose to ghost, which is inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
