We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after they didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no. He then lost interest and stopped communicating, which is ghosting. He mentions he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations. The key issue here is whether ghosting after a first date because someone didn't comply with his expectations is acceptable.\n\nFrom a social perspective, consent and mutual respect are crucial. The author's approach was pretty direct and maybe a bit presumptuous. He expected a certain outcome (sexual activity) based on rumors and prior flirting, which isn't a solid foundation. When she said no, he didn't respect her boundaries and instead of engaging in a conversation about his feelings, he ghosted her. That's pretty harsh. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he was honest about his intentions, and she didn't reciprocate. But honesty doesn't give someone the right to treat the other person poorly. Even if he's honest, respecting her decision is important. The fact that he's using financial reasons (money spent on the date) as part of his reasoning is problematic. It suggests he's placing a monetary value on potential intimacy, which isn't healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, Casey set boundaries, and the author chose not to respect the relationship moving forward. While he's allowed to change his interest, cutting off communication completely without explanation is inconsiderate. People have different expectations, but how you handle the mismatch in expectations matters. Ghosting is usually seen as the asshole move because it's disrespectful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is being dismissive and disrespectful. His actions, while perhaps stemming from personal disappointment, are still hurtful. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
