We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no to intimacy on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author asked bluntly if they could go back to his place after the first date. Casey declined, stating she wasn't interested in that yet and wanted things to develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal responses to her texts. The main issue is that he ghosted her because he wasn't getting what he wanted.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and respect in relationships. Ghosting is when someone abruptly cuts off all communication. It's generally considered rude and inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. In this case, the author's decision to stop communicating after Casey said no could be seen as dismissive of her boundaries. Even if he lost interest, it would be more respectful to have a conversation explaining that he felt things weren't going to work out rather than cutting off contact completely.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he thought he had a \"done deal\" because he believed she had a crush on him. That attitude might show a lack of respect for her autonomy. Assuming someone's intentions without clear consent can lead to misunderstandings. The fact that he was focused on not wasting money and getting what he wanted points to being more transactional in his approach, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. But from a social and ethical standpoint, ghosting is usually frowned upon, regardless of the reason. People have different expectations, but communication is key. The author could have been honest about his expectations upfront or discussed his feelings after the date instead of cutting her off.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Ghosting is inconsiderate, and the author didn't respect her decision by moving on without communication. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
