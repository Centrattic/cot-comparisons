We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted Casey is in the wrong. The scenario is that they went on a first date, he asked her to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest and stopped replying. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The guy was honest about his intentions, which is good. But when she said no, he didn't engage further conversation. Ghosting is generally considered rude, regardless of the reason. Even if he lost interest, cutting off communication without explanation can hurt the other person. Casey tried to reach out, but he ignored her. That's a problem because it's dismissive and doesn't show respect for her feelings.\n\nAlso, the motivation here is important. He mentions he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions did. The fact that he was focused on his own disappointment and the money spent on the date might indicate a lack of emotional consideration. People have different boundaries and pacing in relationships. She wanted to take it slow, but he wasn't interested, so maybe he should have communicated that clearly instead of ghosting. \n\nGhosting is often seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if he's not interested anymore, a simple explanation could have been better. So, even though he's honest about his intentions, the act of ghosting is where he's at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
