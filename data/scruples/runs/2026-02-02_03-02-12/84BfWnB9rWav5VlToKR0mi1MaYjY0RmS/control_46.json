We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about him ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. He asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no, wanting to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. In many relationships, especially in modern dating, there's an emphasis on mutual consent and respect. The author seems to have made a clear assumption that because there were rumors of a crush and some flirting, she would be okay with immediate physical intimacy. But she set a boundary by saying no, and he didn't respect that. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he felt disappointed, cutting her off completely and not addressing his feelings might be seen as inconsiderate. She made it clear she wanted to take things to the second date, which shows she's interested but has her own pace. By ghosting, he's dismissing her boundaries and potentially causing her emotional distress without giving her a chance to explain further or for things to develop naturally.\n\nAlso, his reasoning about the money spent on the date seems a bit shallow. While it's natural to feel that way, valuing an interaction based on financial cost rather than the emotional connection or respect isn't a strong justification. The fact that he lost interest entirely because she didn't comply with his wishes suggests he wasn't looking for a genuine relationship but rather a sexual encounter. That's not necessarily wrong in itself, but if he's entering a relationship expecting a certain outcome and walking away when it doesn't happen, that's disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his intentions. If he's only interested in someone if they're willing to have sex on the first date, then it's his prerogative to not pursue a relationship otherwise. However, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and not being upfront\u2014could be problematic. A more respectful approach might have been to have an open conversation about his expectations and whether they align with hers, rather than cutting her off abruptly.\n\nIn summary, while he might have been clear about his desires, his reaction of ghosting after she set a boundary could be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful. The wrong here is more on the author because he didn't respect her decision and avoided communication, which is generally frowned upon in social interactions.\n"
