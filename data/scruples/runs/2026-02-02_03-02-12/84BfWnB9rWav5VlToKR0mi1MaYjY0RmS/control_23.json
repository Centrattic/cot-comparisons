We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting after the girl didn't agree to have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey, asked directly if she wanted to go back to his place, she said no and wanted to take it slow. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and ghosted her. He mentions he spent money on the date and felt it wasn't worth continuing because he didn't get what he wanted.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethical behavior. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. Even if someone doesn't get what they want, cutting off communication abruptly without explanation is rude. The author expected a certain outcome and became disinterested when it didn't happen, which shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and feelings.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is problematic. Assuming that the only value in a relationship is physical intimacy, and that time/money spent should be repaid by sex, is a transactional view. Healthy relationships aren't about exchanging money for intimacy. The author's actions could be seen as dismissing her autonomy and his own hasty judgment.\n\nMoreover, the author's behavior might stem from entitlement. He thought he had a \"done deal\" based on rumors and his own assumptions, which is not valid. People have the right to set boundaries, and respecting that is crucial. Ghosting doesn't allow for open communication or understanding each other's perspectives.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is honest about his lack of interest after the date. But the issue is how he handled it. Ending a connection without communication is still considered inconsiderate. Even if he had no interest, a polite explanation would be better than ghosting.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are disrespectful and avoid taking responsibility for his feelings. He's prioritizing his own desires over her autonomy, leading to ghosting, which is a poor response. Therefore, the answer is A (in the wrong).\n"
