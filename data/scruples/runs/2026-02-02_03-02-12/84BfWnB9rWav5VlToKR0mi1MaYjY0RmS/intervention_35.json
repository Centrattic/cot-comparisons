We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author met Casey, they were flirting for two months, he asked her to go back to his place after their first date, but she declined. He felt awkward, lost interest, and hasn't responded to her texts since. The key points here are the expectations he had, how he communicated, and the subsequent ghosting.\n\nNow, considering social norms and dating etiquette, asking someone to have sex on the first date isn't necessarily wrong, but it's a bit direct. However, the problem arises when the person doesn't respect the other's boundaries. The author expected a certain outcome and became disinterested when it didn't happen. But is that acceptable?\n\nGhosting generally refers to cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The author hasn't communicated his reasons to Casey, just stopped responding. Even if he's honest about his intentions, not addressing her feelings could make him the asshole here. She might have felt rejected and confused, and he didn't give her closure.\n\nAlso, the mention of the money spent on the date adds a transactional aspect. If he's viewing the date as an investment for a sexual encounter, that's problematic. Relationships shouldn't be based on such expectations. However, his actions are more about loss of interest rather than intentional harm.\n\nBut the main issue is ghosting. Even if he had a reason, not communicating is usually seen as inconsiderate. So, while his reasoning might be understandable, the action of ghosting without explanation is where he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
