We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author went on a first date with a girl named Casey. They had been flirting for a couple of months and there were rumors she had feelings for him. During the date, which included a movie and dinner, he asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said \"no, not tonight\" and mentioned that she wasn't \"like that,\" suggesting she wants to take things slower. The author then zoned out during the rest of the date, and after saying goodbye with a kiss on the cheek and a limp air hug, he hasn't really responded to her texts since. He's been giving her thumbs up or \"k\" replies, effectively ghosting her. The author says he lost interest because she didn't want to have sex on the first date and he spent a lot of money, not wanting to invest more time or money with the risk of not getting what he wanted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting her because she didn't put out on the first date. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nFirst, let's consider the dynamics of the situation. The author approached the date with the intention of sexual activity, as he asked bluntly. Casey declined, wanting to take things slower. The author then lost interest and stopped communicating. \n\nFrom a relationship and communication standpoint, consent and mutual respect are key. The author's desire for physical intimacy is his own, but Casey's boundaries are hers. By asking directly, he put her in a position where she had to decline. His response to her refusal by zoning out and then cutting her off seems dismissive of her boundaries. Even if he felt the date was a \"strike out,\" that's his personal reaction, not necessarily justified. \n\nGhosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Casey reached out after the date, showing she was interested in continuing the relationship, but the author ignored her efforts. Even if he lost interest, a respectful approach would be to communicate that clearly rather than ghosting. \n\nThe author's reasoning about money and the risk of not getting what he wanted could be seen as a red flag. Prioritizing immediate physical gratification over mutual respect and emotional investment might indicate a lack of genuine interest in building a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his preferences. If he's only interested in someone if they are willing to have sex on the first date, then he's not in the wrong for not wanting to pursue someone who doesn't meet that criteria. However, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and not acknowledging her subsequent attempts to communicate\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of his personal standards.\n\nBut in terms of whether he's \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit of a gray area. If he's upfront about his desires and the other person doesn't align with them, is he wrong for not wanting to continue? It's more about whether he respected her boundaries. By asking, he gave her a chance to say no, which she did. His issue is that he didn't accept that answer and instead chose to cut her off without explanation. \n\nThe key point is that he ghosted her. Even if he's not interested anymore, the act of ghosting is generally seen as rude. He could have said something like, \"I asked, you declined, and I don't think we're a good fit,\" which would be more respectful. By not responding and just giving minimal replies, he's being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the rejection respectfully and resorted to ghosting, which is hurtful. Even if his personal standards led to the decision, the way he executed it was poor. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
