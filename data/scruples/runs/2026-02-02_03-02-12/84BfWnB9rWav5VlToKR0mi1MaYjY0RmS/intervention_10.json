We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author claims they lost all interest and don't want to continue because they spent money and don't want to risk another date without getting any. \n\nHmm. So, the key points here are honesty, communication, and mutual respect. The author was upfront about wanting to have sex, and the other person said no. Then the author ghosted her, not responding beyond minimal replies.\n\nFirst, was the author wrong to ask about sex so directly on the first date? Maybe, but it's their choice. People have different standards. The problem might be more about how they handled the rejection. The other person wanted to take it slow, and the author reacted by cutting off communication. Ghosting is generally seen as disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if they lost interest, a straightforward conversation would be better. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the financial aspect as a reason, which could come off as transactional. Valuing a relationship based on money or expecting something in return for dates isn't healthy. The person who said no is within their rights to set boundaries, and the author's response seems dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because ghosting isn't respectful, and prioritizing money over the relationship is problematic. They should have communicated their feelings clearly instead of cutting her off.\n"
