We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after they said no on the first date. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post. The author asked Casey to go back to his place on the first date, she said no, and then he ghosted her because he lost interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. Ghosting someone after they say no to sex is a common topic. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted. But is that a valid reason? \n\nIn many relationships and dating discussions, respect is key. If the author was clear about his expectations (sex on the first date) and Casey said no, then he needs to respect her decision. Wanting physical intimacy is normal, but pressuring someone or ending the relationship immediately because they don't comply can be problematic. \n\nThe author mentions wanting to be honest, which is good, but then he didn't communicate his disappointment or his need to end things. He just stopped responding. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect\u2014feeling like he wasted money\u2014shouldn't affect how he treats her. The cost of a date doesn't justify ghosting. If he wasn't okay with the possibility of not getting physical, maybe he shouldn't have asked so directly on the first date.\n\nAnother point is that he gave her a chance on the second date, but he didn't follow up. Instead of being open to building a relationship, he cut her off. That shows a lack of commitment to getting to know her beyond just physical attraction. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, sex on the first date isn't the standard for everyone. Some people prefer to take things slower. The author's assumption that she would say yes, given the rumors of her having a crush, might have been a misread. Respecting her boundaries is important, even if it's not what he wanted.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is being asked if it's okay to ghost someone after they say no. The key factors are respect for her decision, communication, and maturity in handling rejection. Ghosting is usually seen as the asshole move here because it's inconsiderate. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they're dismissive and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
