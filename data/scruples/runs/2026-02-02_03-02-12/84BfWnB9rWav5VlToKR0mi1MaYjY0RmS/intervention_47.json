We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author thought she had a crush on him for months, so he expected her to be okay with fooling around. When she said no, he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect. The author pushed for physical intimacy, and Casey set a boundary by saying no. Respecting her decision is crucial. Ghosting after someone sets a boundary might show a lack of respect for her feelings. Even if the author lost interest, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. The author didn't address his expectations before the date. Maybe he should have discussed his desires more clearly. Assuming she would agree to sex because of rumors about her feelings isn't fair. People have different boundaries, and it's important to communicate them upfront.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect mentioned\u2014feeling like he wasted money\u2014seems to be a factor. But that shouldn't influence how he treats someone. Ghosting because of money is a red flag. Relationships shouldn't be transactional in that way.\n\nHowever, the author might argue he's honest and just lost interest. But even if someone loses interest, it's better to communicate that rather than ghost. Not replying to her texts shows a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel justified, his actions ignored her boundaries and were disrespectful. He's in the wrong for not respecting her no and for ghosting instead of having an open conversation.\n"
