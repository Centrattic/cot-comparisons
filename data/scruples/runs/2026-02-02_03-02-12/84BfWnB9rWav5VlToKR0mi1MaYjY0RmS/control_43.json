We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having a crush for longer. They went on a first date where he asked her if she wanted to go back to his place and be intimate. She said no, not tonight, and said they should let things develop. He then zoned out, didn't respond much, and after the date didn't communicate more, just minimal replies. He felt like he wasted money and lost interest.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for ghosting her. Well, from an ethical standpoint, ghosting is usually considered rude because it's cutting off communication without explanation. But the user says he's not trying to hurt her, just lost interest. But here's the thing: he made a request for sexual activity on the first date, which she declined. He expected her to be okay with that, but he was disappointed and ghosted her. \n\nIs it wrong to lose interest if someone doesn't meet your expectations? Maybe. But the problem could be in how he approached it. He was blunt and put all his cards on the table, which might have been too forward for her. Also, not communicating after, instead of just being honest about his feelings, he chose to ghost, which is inconsiderate. Even if he's not interested anymore, being respectful and explaining why would be better than ghosting. So maybe he's in the wrong because of the ghosting, regardless of his reasons. Alternatively, if he's honest about his lack of interest, that's different. But ghosting is a passive-aggressive way to end things. So probably A, he's the asshole for ghosting, even if his feelings changed.\n"
