We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author asked Casey if they could go back to his place to \"fool around\" after a first date. She said no, wanting to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and hasn't communicated much since. He's justifying it by saying he lost all interest and the cost of the date. \n\nNow, considering consent and respect. The author's approach was pretty direct, asking for sex on the first date. Casey had the right to say no, and respecting boundaries is crucial. By ghosting her, he's cutting her off without communication. That's not respectful. Even if he didn't want to pursue a relationship anymore, a simple explanation would have been better than ghosting.\n\nAlso, there's the issue of maturity in relationships. Wanting to take things slow is a valid reason for her to say no. The author's decision to lose interest because she didn't comply with his immediate desires shows a lack of respect for her boundaries and values. The fact that he's focusing on the money spent instead of the emotional impact on Casey is another red flag. \n\nGhosting is generally considered inconsiderate. It leaves the other person confused and can be hurtful. The author didn't give Casey a chance to explain her perspective further or to express her feelings. Instead, he shut her out, which is inconsiderate regardless of his reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that he was honest from the start and that Casey didn't meet his expectations. However, honesty shouldn't be used as a reason to disregard someone's autonomy. Everyone has different standards and pacing in relationships, and it's important to respect those differences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel justified in his actions, his behavior of ghosting after she set a boundary is inconsiderate and disrespectful. So, the answer would be A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
