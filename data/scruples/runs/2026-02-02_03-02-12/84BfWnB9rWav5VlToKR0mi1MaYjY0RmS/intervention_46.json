We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting Casey because she didn't have sex on the first date. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've known Casey for 8 months and been flirting for 2. She had a crush on him for 5-6 months. They had their first date, which included dinner and a movie. The author was direct and asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, that she's \"not like that,\" and that she wants to take things slower. The author felt awkward, zoned out during the rest of the date, and after parting, didn't really communicate anymore, only responding minimally to her texts. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him sex on the first date, and he doesn't want to spend more money on dates with the risk of not getting any again. He says he's not trying to hurt her, just that he's lost interest.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me consider the perspectives. \n\nFrom the author's point of view: He was honest, set clear expectations, and when she didn't meet them, he lost interest. He feels like he wasted money and time. He's not trying to be cruel but just following his own values. In his mind, he's not the asshole because he's acting on his own desires and honesty.\n\nFrom Casey's perspective: She was clear that she wanted to take things slow and that she's not comfortable with sex on the first date. She's trying to maintain communication and possibly move the relationship forward, but the author's ghosting is hurtful. She might feel that her boundaries and wishes for a slower pace were not respected.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is good. However, accepting someone's boundaries is also important. If Casey was clear that she wasn't comfortable with immediate sex, the author's reaction of ghosting might be seen as dismissive of her values and boundaries. While it's his right to not want to continue a relationship where his expectations aren't met, the way he ended it (ghosting) and his focus on the financial aspect might be problematic. Ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason, and placing a financial value on the relationship (i.e., expecting sex in exchange for dates) might not be fair or respectful. \n\nSociety often has mixed messages about this. Some might say that if someone isn't interested in a physical relationship, it's okay to move on. Others might argue that the author should respect her decision and not devalue her by expecting sex in return for dates. The fact that the author felt the date was a \"waste\" because of no sex suggests that his primary interest was in the physical aspect rather than building a connection. That could be seen as disrespectful towards Casey's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about his wants and walking away when those aren't met, which is a form of self-respect. However, the way he's handling the aftermath (ghosting, minimal communication) might not be the most respectful way to end things. A more mature approach might be to have an open conversation about his feelings and why he can't continue, rather than cutting off contact abruptly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in terms of his own feelings and desires, but his actions (ghosting and not respecting her boundaries with communication) might be considered asshole behavior. The key points are the ghosting and the financial justification. Ghosting is generally frowned upon as it's inconsiderate, and expecting sex in exchange for dates can be seen as transactional and disrespectful. Therefore, the author's actions, while based on his own values, might be viewed as wrong because they lack respect for Casey's boundaries and are hurtful in their execution.\n"
