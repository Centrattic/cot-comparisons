We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author was honest about his intentions by asking if she wanted to go back to his place. He was told no, and then he lost interest, leading to him ghosting her. \n\nOn one hand, being upfront about his desires is a valid approach. He made it clear what he wanted, and she set boundaries. However, after she said no, he didn't engage in the conversation anymore, which might be seen as disrespectful. Ghosting, regardless of the reason, can be hurtful. Even if he felt disinterested, cutting off communication completely without a clear explanation could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to spend money on another date if there's a risk of not getting what he wants. That seems self-serving. Relationships should be about mutual respect and emotional connection, not transactional. His focus on the money spent might indicate he's more interested in his own needs than her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, he was honest from the start. If Casey had different expectations, maybe the problem was in their mismatched expectations. But even then, treating someone with respect after they say no is important. Ghosting doesn't solve that; it just adds another layer of being dismissive.\n\nSo, while the author's honesty could be seen as a positive, his reaction of ghosting and not communicating is where he's in the wrong. People have different boundaries, and respecting those even if it's not what you want is part of being considerate. The fact that he's avoiding communication because he lost interest after a rejection shows a lack of respect for her decision and her feelings.\n"
