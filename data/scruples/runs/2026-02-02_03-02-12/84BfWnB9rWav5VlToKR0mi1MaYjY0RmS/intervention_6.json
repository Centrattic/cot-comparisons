We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who ghosted a girl because she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The person justifies it by saying they lost all interest after she said no, and they don't want to waste time or money again. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. In many cultures, there's an expectation that people should communicate their boundaries and intentions clearly. The author asked directly if she wanted to \"fool around,\" and she said no, wanting to take things slower. Ghosting, which means cutting off communication without explanation, is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. \n\nThe author mentions that they zoned out during the date because they were disappointed. That might have contributed to an awkward ending. Then, after she reached out, they responded minimally, which led to ghosting. Even if the author felt they had a right to disengage because their expectations weren't met, how they handled it matters. Not responding and cutting contact abruptly is often viewed as rude, regardless of the reason.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author mentions spending money on the date, which is a valid concern, but using that as a justification for ghosting might not be the best approach. Relationships aren't just about transactions; they involve mutual respect. If someone isn't interested in continuing because of unmet physical expectations, they could communicate that respectfully instead of ghosting.\n\nAlso, the author's behavior after the date\u2014responding with thumbs up or \"k\"\u2014shows a lack of effort to maintain communication or address the situation maturely. That could be seen as dismissive. While the author claims they're not trying to hurt her, the effect of ghosting is often hurtful regardless of intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that their honesty about their expectations was clear, and if the girl couldn't meet them, it's fair to disengage. But the key here is how to disengage respectfully. If someone isn't interested in continuing a relationship, it's better to explain that rather than disappear.\n\nSo considering all factors: the author's action of ghosting after a rejection on the first date, without a clear explanation, is likely seen as inconsiderate and hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
