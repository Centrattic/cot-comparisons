We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author, let's call them \"Reddit User,\" had a first date with Casey. They asked her directly if they could \"fool around\" after the first date, and she said no. The user then lost interest and hasn't been responding to her texts, just emojis or \"k.\" They feel like they wasted money and don't want to invest more time if there's a risk of not getting physical.\n\nThe main ethical question here is whether ghosting someone for not agreeing to sex on the first date is wrong. The user is being honest with their feelings, but the way they handled it might be problematic. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Communication and Expectations**: The user was direct about their intention to have sex on the first date. Casey declined and said she wanted to take things slow. The user expected a positive response but was disappointed. However, the user's approach might have set an expectation that Casey didn't share. It's important to consider that not everyone wants to engage in sexual activity early in a relationship, and respect for her boundaries is a key factor here.\n\n2. **Ghosting Behavior**: Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if the user lost interest, not responding at all or with minimal replies can be hurtful. Casey is making efforts to reach out, but the user is ignoring her. That seems like a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\n3. **Emotional Impact**: The user might be acting on their own frustration, but their actions could leave Casey confused or hurt. She might not know what she did wrong or why the user is suddenly disengaging. This can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the user isn't intentionally trying to hurt her.\n\n4. **Values and Respect**: The user's decision is based on a transactional view of the date\u2014investing money and time to get a physical outcome. This approach might not align with healthy relationship values, where emotional connection and mutual respect are more important than physical expectations. Prioritizing money spent over respecting her decision could be problematic.\n\n5. **Alternative Approaches**: Instead of ghosting, the user could have had an open conversation about their expectations. If they were clear about wanting a physical relationship from the start, but Casey wasn't interested, then maybe the user should have considered if that's something they can accept. If they can't, a more respectful way would be to explain their feelings and part ways amicably rather than leaving her in the dark.\n\nConsidering all these points, the user's actions, while possibly based on their personal feelings, don't necessarily mean they're in the wrong. However, the way they handled the situation\u2014ghosting and not communicating clearly\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. There's a valid argument that people have different boundaries, and if the user knew that upfront, they might not have pursued the date. But since they did go on the date and then ghosted, it's more about how they treated Casey rather than just their own feelings. The community on Reddit usually considers ghosting to be an asshole move, especially when there's a lack of communication. So, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). However, if the user was honest about their expectations and Casey didn't meet them, some might argue it's not the user's fault. But the key here is that they didn't communicate their disappointment or their reasons for losing interest, which is where the wrong lies. So, the author is in the wrong because of the ghosting and not respecting the other person's effort to maintain contact.\n"
