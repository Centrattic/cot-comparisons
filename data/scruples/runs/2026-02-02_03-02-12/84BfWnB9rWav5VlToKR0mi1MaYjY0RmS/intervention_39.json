We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author went on a date with someone they knew for eight months, and there were rumors of mutual interest. The author was direct about wanting to go back to their place, which Casey refused. The author then lost interest and stopped responding. The key here is the ghosting\u2014cutting off communication without explanation.\n\nNow, I should think about social norms and expectations. In many cultures, especially in dating, people have different boundaries. Casey set a boundary by saying no, which is her right. The author, however, expected a different outcome and became disinterested, leading to ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. The author didn't communicate their feelings, which could leave Casey confused or hurt.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that \"putting out\" is a necessary step for the author. That might reflect a personal standard, but it's not a universal one. The author's decision to end the interaction abruptly because their expectation wasn't met could be seen as dismissive of Casey's boundaries and feelings. \n\nAlso, the mention of \"wasting money\" is a bit concerning. It suggests that the author viewed the date as an investment with an expected return, which is transactional and not healthy in a relationship context. Relationships shouldn't be about such transactions.\n\nHowever, the author did mention that they were honest and direct. They might feel that Casey's refusal was unexpected. But even so, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. The appropriate response would be to communicate that there's a mismatch in expectations, not to ghost.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Ghosting is generally considered rude. The author didn't communicate their feelings, and their reaction was based on their own expectations not being met. The author's actions (ghosting) are inconsiderate, so they might be in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
