We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The author expected a \"done deal\" but was rejected and then lost interest, leading to ghosting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author approached the date with the intention of having sex, which he made clear. Casey declined and wanted to take things slower. The author then became disinterested and stopped communicating. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. The author's main issue was that she didn't meet his expectation for physical intimacy, so he decided to cut her off. That seems dismissive and possibly disrespectful. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that he's under no obligation to continue if there's no mutual interest. But in this case, Casey was interested in continuing the relationship, as shown by her follow-up texts. The author's decision to ghost is more about his own unmet expectations rather than any wrongdoing by Casey. \n\nAlso, the author's focus on the money spent on the date as a factor in his decision is problematic. It suggests that he valued the transaction over the relationship, which isn't fair. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's understandable to feel disappointed when expectations aren't met, the appropriate response would be to communicate that and part ways respectfully. Ghosting is a form of emotional manipulation and is typically seen as the person's fault who does it without explanation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't respect Casey's boundaries and chose to ghost her instead of having an honest conversation about his feelings.\n"
