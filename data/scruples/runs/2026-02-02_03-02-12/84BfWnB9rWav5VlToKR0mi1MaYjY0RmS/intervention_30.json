We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she declined to have sex on the first date. The author was clear about wanting to \"fool around\" and was rejected. He then lost interest and stopped responding, which is considered ghosting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even though the author felt Casey was an \"easy sell,\" his reaction of cutting off all communication might be harsh. He admits to zoning out during the date and focusing only on his disappointment, which shows poor communication. \n\nCasey, on the other hand, tried to continue the conversation and even reached out afterward. The author's decision to ghost might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. While the author might not have intended to hurt her, his actions still hurt her. \n\nHowever, the author is being honest about his lack of interest post-rejection. Some might argue that if someone is only interested in a physical relationship, they should know upfront. But the problem here is the way he handled the rejection. Ghosting is typically frowned upon regardless of the reason. \n\nAlso, the author's focus on the money spent on the date might be a factor. He mentions regretting the expense, which could indicate he approached the date transactionally, expecting a certain outcome. That's not necessarily ethical, but it's part of his mindset. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are communication and respect. The author didn't communicate his disappointment and instead cut her off completely. While he's not the first person to ghost due to rejection, the act itself is generally considered inconsiderate. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong. But some might argue B because he's being honest about his intentions. However, the method of ending communication is the issue here.\n"
