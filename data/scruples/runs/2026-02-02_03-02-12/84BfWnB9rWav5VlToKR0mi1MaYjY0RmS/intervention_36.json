We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he expected a \"done deal\" because he thought she had a crush on him for months. But when she said \"not tonight,\" he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around dating and expectations. In many relationships, people do have different expectations regarding intimacy. The author was upfront about wanting to \"fool around,\" which Casey declined. That's her right, as consent and personal boundaries are crucial. However, the author's reaction\u2014ghosting because his expectations weren't met\u2014can be problematic.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as a poor communication strategy. Even if someone's interest wanes, cutting off all contact abruptly without explanation can be hurtful. The key here is whether the author had the right to assume Casey would comply with his expectations for a sexual encounter on the first date. In most healthy relationships, mutual consent and comfort are essential, and rushing into physical intimacy isn't advisable. However, the author's decision to ghost might be seen as inconsiderate, even if his actions were based on his own expectations.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of honesty. The author was upfront about his intentions, so Casey had a chance to say no. She did decline, and the author decided that was the end of the relationship. While this might not be kind, it's not necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense, but socially, it's frowned upon to cut someone off without communication. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of personal choice, but his actions could be considered disrespectful because they dismiss Casey's boundaries and her desire to continue the relationship.\n\nSo, the debate is whether the author's ghosting is justified. If the author's actions are based on personal preferences and he's choosing to disengage because his needs aren't met, that's his choice. However, the method of disengagement (ghosting) is often seen as inconsiderate. In terms of being an asshole, it's more about the approach than the decision to disengage. Therefore, the answer hinges on whether ghosting is considered the asshole move, which it often is, even if the reasons are personal.\n"
