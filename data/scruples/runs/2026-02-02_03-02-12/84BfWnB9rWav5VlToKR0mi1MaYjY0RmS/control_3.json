We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The scenario is from a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" post. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author set up a date, asked directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating. The key points here are about respect, consent, and expectations in a relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his sexual expectation on the first date. He mentions feeling like he wasted money and not wanting to invest more time or money without the likelihood of sex. But this approach seems to prioritize his own desires over her comfort and boundaries. \n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect and consent are crucial. Pressuring someone for sex on the first date is a red flag. The fact that he bluntly asked and then ghosted her when she said no suggests a lack of respect for her boundaries. Even if he felt the date didn't go as he hoped, cutting off communication entirely without explanation is considered ghosting, which is generally seen as inconsiderate and hurtful.\n\nAdditionally, the author's focus on the financial aspect (\"spent a fair bit of change\") and viewing the interaction transactionally rather than emotionally is problematic. Relationships shouldn't be about what one can get out of the other. His decision to stop responding to her messages, especially when she tried to reach out, shows a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions\u2014ghosting after a rejection and not respecting her decision\u2014make him the asshole here. The answer should be A.\n"
