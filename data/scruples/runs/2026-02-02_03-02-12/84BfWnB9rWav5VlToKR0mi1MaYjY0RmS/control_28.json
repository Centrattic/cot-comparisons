We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting after the girl didn't sleep with him on the first date. Hmm.\n\nSo, the scenario is that the guy, let's call him \"the author,\" and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having a crush for longer. They went on a first date\u2014movie, dinner. He asked bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and suggested the second date. He then lost interest, didn't respond well, and ghosted her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are: Is it wrong to lose interest and ghost someone for not agreeing to a sexual encounter on the first date? The author mentions feeling like he \"struck out\" and was focused on the money spent. That's a bit concerning because valuing a date based on financial cost and immediate sexual satisfaction might not be respectful.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that dating involves getting to know someone beyond just physical aspects. Ghosting, which means cutting off communication without explanation, is generally seen as inconsiderate. The author didn't even explain his decision to Casey. She reached out, and he ignored her. That's dismissive and could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for losing interest is solely about the lack of sexual activity. That might indicate he wasn't genuinely interested in a relationship but was more focused on a physical connection. When someone doesn't meet that immediate expectation, his reaction is to end all contact. That's not healthy for building a relationship based on mutual respect and understanding.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his prerogative to not pursue a relationship if his expectations aren't met. But the problem here is the approach\u2014ghosting is a poor way to handle it. Being honest about not wanting to continue because of the lack of sexual interest would be better, even if it's awkward. \n\nAdditionally, the author's focus on the financial aspect (\"money wasted\") is a red flag. Valuing the date more by the cost than by the experience and mutual enjoyment isn't a sign of respect. \n\nIn terms of ethical standards, relationships should be about mutual respect. Ghosting is often viewed as a breach of that respect. So even if the author's actions stem from personal disappointment, the method of cutting off communication is inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
