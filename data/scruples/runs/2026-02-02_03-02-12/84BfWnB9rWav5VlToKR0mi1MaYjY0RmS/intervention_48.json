We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't \"put out,\" and he didn't want to invest more time or money without getting what he wanted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations around dating. In many cultures, there's an unspoken assumption that people might expect physical intimacy to happen eventually, but not necessarily on the first date. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is a point in his favor. However, he also made it clear that he was only interested if she was willing to have sex, which could be seen as pressuring her or having a transactional view of the relationship.\n\nGhosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can be hurtful. Even if the author felt disappointed, cutting off communication entirely without explanation might be considered inconsiderate. The fact that he's ignoring her subsequent messages adds to that. On the other hand, he's honest about his reasoning and doesn't claim to be doing it to hurt her. He also mentions that he lost interest, which is a personal choice, but the method of ending communication is questionable.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. He mentions spending money on the date, which might reflect a transactional mindset. However, that's his own money to spend, and while it's understandable to feel it was a loss, it's not a valid reason to ghost someone. People often spend money on dates without expecting immediate reciprocation in that way.\n\nThe woman said she wanted to take things slow and build the relationship, which is a common and reasonable stance. The author, however, saw that as a rejection and decided to disengage. The key point here is whether the author respected her boundaries and her expressed desire to take things slower. He did ask bluntly, so she had a chance to say no, and he had to respect her answer. But instead of communicating his feelings or setting clear expectations, he chose to ghost, which is not a respectful way to handle the situation.\n\nIn terms of emotional maturity, the author might be prioritizing his own needs over hers, but the method of ending the connection is where he's at fault. Ghosting lacks accountability and can leave the other person confused and hurt. Even if he's not in love anymore, a more considerate approach would be to explain his feelings, albeit honestly, rather than cutting off contact abruptly.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions\u2014while perhaps born from disappointment\u2014are ethically questionable due to the ghosting and the lack of communication. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
