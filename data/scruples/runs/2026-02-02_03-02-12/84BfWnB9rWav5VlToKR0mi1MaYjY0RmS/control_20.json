We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person, let's call him John, went on a first date with Casey. They had been flirting for two months, and there were rumors that Casey had a crush on him. During the date, John asked her if they could go to his place to \"fool around,\" which sounds like a direct request for sexual activity. Casey refused, saying no to the first date and suggested they take things slower. John then lost interest, became distant, and hasn't responded beyond minimal replies to her messages. The question is whether he's the asshole for ghosting her.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication and mutual respect. John was honest with his intentions, which is good, but Casey made it clear she wasn't interested in moving that quickly. He seems to have interpreted her refusal as a deal-breaker. The problem is that he cut her off without further communication. Ghosting isn't typically considered respectful, even if someone is upset or disappointed. \n\nAlso, he mentions the money spent on the date, implying he felt it was a loss. But that's not her fault. People can't be expected to pay for dates and expect satisfaction otherwise. His decision to lose interest after a rejection might be his personal choice, but it's not necessarily wrong to have that reaction. However, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the issue lies. \n\nIn terms of relationships and dating norms, it's important to respect each other's boundaries. If Casey wasn't interested in sexual activity yet, that's her right. John's response of ghosting is dismissive and doesn't give her a chance to address the situation or maybe clarify her stance. He could have had an honest conversation about his expectations and how her refusal affected him. Instead, he just cut her off. \n\nSo, while his actions stem from personal disappointment, the lack of communication and the abrupt ending might make him the asshole. People have different expectations, but reacting with ghosting is generally frowned upon. It's possible he's not in the wrong for losing interest, but the way he handled it is problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. \n\nWait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not responding because he's lost interest, maybe he's just being honest. But ghosting is usually considered hurtful regardless of the reason. There's a difference between not wanting to pursue a relationship and cutting someone off without explanation. So, the consensus would likely be that he is in the wrong because of the ghosting, not the decision to lose interest per se. So answer A.\n"
