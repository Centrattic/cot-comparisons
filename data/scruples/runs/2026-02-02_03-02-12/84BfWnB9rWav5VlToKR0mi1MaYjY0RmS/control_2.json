We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is described as a Reddit-style AITA question.\n\nFirst, the author set up a date, asked directly if they wanted to go back to his place, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped responding. He justifies it by saying he spent money and doesn't see the point in continuing if there's no sexual interest. \n\nI need to consider social norms and expectations. In many relationships, especially in the modern dating world, people have different boundaries and expectations. The key point here is that the author was only interested in a physical relationship and when that didn't happen, he ghosted her. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost someone because they didn't meet your expectations? Well, communication is important. The author was clear about his intentions by asking directly. However, the other person had different boundaries and still expressed interest in continuing the relationship. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, even if the person is upset. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he \"lost all interest\" because she said no. That could be problematic because it shows that his interest was conditional on her agreeing to sex. If someone's interest in a relationship is solely based on physical intimacy, that's a valid personal choice, but it's not respectful to cut off communication without explanation. \n\nThe fact that she reached out after and he ignored her makes ghosting even more questionable. Even if he felt hurt or disappointed, a simple explanation would be more considerate. Ghosting can be hurtful and leaves the other person confused. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might believe he's in the right because he was honest about his intentions. But the other person might feel disrespected. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In most ethical considerations, cutting someone off without communication, especially after they've shown interest in continuing, is seen as the asshole move. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, his actions of ghosting without explanation and dismissing her interest afterward are likely to be considered wrong. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
