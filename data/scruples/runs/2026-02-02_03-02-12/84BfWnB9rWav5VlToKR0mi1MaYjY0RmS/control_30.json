We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is described in the provided text.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and Casey had been flirting for months, and there were rumors she had feelings. They went on a first date where he asked her if they could go to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest and hasn't replied to her texts, just minimal responses.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, respect, and expectations. The author was honest about his intentions early on, which is good, but he might have been too forward on a first date. However, the problem arises when he ghosted her after she said no. Ghosting usually means cutting off all contact abruptly without explanation, which is generally considered inconsiderate.\n\nThe author mentions that he didn't respond to her texts, only giving thumbs up or \"k.\" That's ghosting behavior. Even if he lost interest, he should have communicated why instead of leaving her hanging. His actions could hurt her feelings because she's trying to reach out, and he's ignoring her. The fact that there was a \"limp air hug\" might indicate a lack of proper closure.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he spent money and wanted a sexual encounter quickly, which isn't a valid reason to ghost someone. Respect for her boundaries and her decision is important. If he wasn't okay with taking things slower, maybe he shouldn't have pursued a relationship in the first place. The expectation that she would be okay with sex on the first date might be unrealistic, and his reaction shows a lack of respect for her decision.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions of ghosting are inconsiderate and disrespectful. He should have either respected her boundaries and continued the relationship without expecting immediate sex or communicated his disinterest properly. Ghosting without explanation is usually seen as the asshole move here. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
