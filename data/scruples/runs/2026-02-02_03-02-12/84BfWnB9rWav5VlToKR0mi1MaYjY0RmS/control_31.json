We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The guy, let's call him John, had known Casey for 8 months, with flirting going on for 2 months. There were rumors she had a crush for 5-6 months. They went on a date, did normal things. John asked bluntly if they could go to his place to \"fool around\". She said no, not tonight, and wanted to let things develop. He zoned out, didn't respond much, and after the date, he ghosted her. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether ghosting is justified because she didn't comply with his expectations of physical intimacy on the first date. From a relationship and social norms perspective, respecting someone's boundaries is key. If John was clear about his expectations and she said no, then his response of losing interest and cutting off contact might be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nHe mentions that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" because she supposedly had a crush on him. That implies he assumed her consent without considering her actual feelings or boundaries. The fact that she wanted to take it slower shows she's respectful of her own boundaries, but John's reaction of ghosting and focusing on the money spent suggests he's prioritizing his own wants over her autonomy. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if he lost interest, the proper response would be to communicate that respectfully rather than cutting off contact abruptly. The fact that he's responding with minimal replies when she reaches out indicates he's not being honest with her, which can be hurtful.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's under no obligation to continue talking if he's lost interest. But the key here is that his loss of interest was due to her refusing his request, which could be seen as a deal-breaker for him but doesn't negate her right to set boundaries. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while people have different expectations, pressuring someone for physical intimacy on a first date is common but can lead to discomfort. If someone says no, respecting that is important. The author's actions might be seen as the asshole move because he didn't respect her decision and instead chose to ghost, which is hurtful and lacks communication. \n\nAdditionally, his focus on the money spent is a red flag. Relationships shouldn't be transactional in that way. The value of the date shouldn't influence how he treats her. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundaries, ghosted without explanation, and allowed financial considerations to affect his behavior negatively.\n"
