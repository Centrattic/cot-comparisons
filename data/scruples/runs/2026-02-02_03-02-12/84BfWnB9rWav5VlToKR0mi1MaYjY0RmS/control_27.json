We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author set up the situation where he was clear about wanting to have sex, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was honest upfront about his intentions. He thought she was into him because there were rumors and she had a crush, but she declined. He felt disappointed and stopped engaging. The key points here are consent, respect, and communication.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. Even if the author lost interest, ending the relationship by ghosting isn't respectful. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that he was clear about his expectations. But that doesn't justify ghosting. Relationships require mutual respect, and if he had no interest in continuing, a direct conversation would have been better than ghosting.\n\nAlso, the author's focus on the money spent might be a red flag. It's not appropriate to view dating as an investment expecting returns. His reaction might indicate a transactional attitude rather than genuine interest in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, he was honest about his intentions, and she was clear about her boundaries. If he can't accept her boundaries, then moving on isn't necessarily wrong, but doing so through ghosting is. There's a difference between being honest about not wanting to continue and ghosting someone.\n\nThe ethical consideration here is about how to end things respectfully. Even if he had no interest, a simple explanation would be better. Ghosting is inconsiderate regardless of the reason. So, the author is in the wrong for ghosting, but maybe not entirely for wanting to move on. The main issue is the method of ending the interaction.\n"
