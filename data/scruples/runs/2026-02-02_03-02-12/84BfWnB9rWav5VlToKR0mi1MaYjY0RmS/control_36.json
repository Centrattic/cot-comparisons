We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author ghosted a girl named Casey after she didn't want to have sex on the first date. The author felt like he had a \"done deal\" because there were rumors of her having feelings for him and he was confident she would say yes. After she declined, he lost interest, stopped responding, and now just gives minimal replies. He's justifying it by saying he spent money and doesn't want to go through another date without guaranteed sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The author didn't communicate his feelings clearly after the date. Even if he lost interest, he could have been honest with her instead of cutting off contact. Also, assuming she would say yes to sex based on rumors and previous flirting might be a case of making assumptions without clear consent. Respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. The fact that he felt it was a \"done deal\" shows a lack of respect for her autonomy. Plus, using the excuse of money spent as a reason to ghost is not a valid justification. People should date for connection, not financial transactions. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has the right to his preferences, but the way he handled it\u2014ghosting and being dismissive\u2014is where the issue lies. The key points are: not respecting her decision, lack of communication, and ghosting. All of these contribute to the author being in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
