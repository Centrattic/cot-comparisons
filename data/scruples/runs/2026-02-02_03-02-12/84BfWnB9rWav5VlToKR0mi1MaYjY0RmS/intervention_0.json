We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The situation is that the two have been flirting for a while, went on a first date, and the author asked if they could go back to his place to fool around. The girl said no, and the author lost interest, so he started ghosting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations here. In many cultures, there's an expectation that both parties should be on the same page regarding the pace of a relationship. The author was direct about his intentions, which is honest, but maybe too forward for someone who was building up slowly. The girl indicated she wanted to take things slower, and the author's reaction was to withdraw entirely.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as a negative behavior because it's abrupt and can be hurtful. It leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the method of cutting off communication is harsh. The fact that the girl reached out again with texts and the author didn't respond beyond minimal replies might indicate that he's avoiding her rather than being honest.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that he lost interest after the rejection. It's his right to not want to continue if his expectations aren't met, but the way he handled it is questionable. There's also the aspect of spending money on the date and feeling that it was a waste, which might be a personal issue. But using that as a reason to ghost could be seen as immature or self-centered.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author had communicated his feelings clearly, even if it was honest, it might have been better for both parties. Instead of ghosting, explaining that he was looking for something more physical and they weren't aligned could have been a more respectful approach. Ghosting, regardless of the reason, often leaves the other person confused and feeling rejected without understanding why.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid\u2014feeling rejected and losing interest\u2014it's the method of handling the rejection that's problematic. The girl wanted to continue the relationship, and he abruptly ended communication. That seems to be inconsiderate of her feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for ghosting her without giving a clear explanation.\n"
