We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't go along with his plan on the first date. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nSo, the author had known Casey for 8 months, there was flirting for 2 months, and rumors about her having a crush for 5-6 months. They went on a first date, which included watching a movie and dinner. The author bluntly asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" which she declined, saying they should wait for the second date. He got awkward, zoned out during the rest of the date, and after that, he didn't reply to her texts beyond minimal responses. He's now justified ghosting her because he lost interest after she didn't meet his expectations, and he's concerned about the money spent on the date.\n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole here. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person without closure. However, the context matters. The author was upfront about his intentions, which Casey didn't reciprocate. He admits he lost interest and doesn't want to continue pursuing her. \n\nOn one hand, being honest about his desires is valid. If he was clear and she didn't meet those expectations, he might feel justified in moving on. On the other hand, not communicating properly could be hurtful. Ghosting can be considered inconsiderate regardless of the reason. Even if he's not interested anymore, a polite explanation might have been better.\n\nAnother angle is the pressure he put on her. Asking to \"fool around\" on the first date might have set an expectation that wasn't mutual. If he was aware she was interested but preferred to wait, maybe he should have respected that from the start. His reaction of losing all interest might be a personal choice, but it's not necessarily right or wrong. However, cutting off communication without explanation could be seen as harsh.\n\nThe financial aspect he mentioned is a bit of a red flag. Using money as a factor in his decision might indicate shallow motives, which could affect how the situation is perceived. People often have different priorities, but focusing on the cost rather than mutual connection might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nIn terms of communication, the author didn't engage with her after the date, which is where the issue lies. Even if he's not interested, a kind goodbye could prevent her from being confused or hurt. Ghosting can be seen as a lack of respect for the other person's feelings.\n\nSo, synthesizing all this, while the author's actions stem from personal disappointment, the act of ghosting\u2014without explanation\u2014might be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, he could be in the wrong. However, if someone's only goal is physical intimacy and that's not met, they might feel justified in moving on. But in most social contexts, ghosting is frowned upon regardless of the reason. Hence, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to make sure I'm not overcomplicating it.\n"
