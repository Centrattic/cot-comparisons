We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The author's main reasoning is that he lost interest because he was expecting physical intimacy and was disappointed when she said \"no.\" He also mentions the money spent on the date and not wanting to risk another rejection.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it cuts off communication without closure. However, if someone genuinely loses interest after a specific issue arises, some might argue it's their right to disengage. But the key points here are the author's expectations and his reaction.\n\nHe asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to his place, and she said \"no, not tonight.\" He thought he had a \"done deal\" because of the rumors of her having a crush on him. That suggests he might have misread her signals or had unrealistic expectations. Assuming someone wants to have sex just because they've shown interest in a relationship is problematic. It's important to respect boundaries and consent.\n\nThe author's response was to lose interest and ghost her. While he's within his rights to disengage, the way he did it\u2014without explanation\u2014could be seen as hurtful. However, the context is that he felt his expectations weren't met, which led to a loss of interest. The question is whether he's wrong for that. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respecting someone's no is crucial. If he's only interested in a relationship if it includes immediate physical intimacy, that's his preference, but expecting others to meet that expectation without mutual discussion is where the potential issue lies. Ghosting is often frowned upon, but if the person is no longer interested, some might argue it's not entirely his fault. However, the way he rationalizes the situation\u2014focusing on the money and his loss of interest\u2014might make him seem more self-centered.\n\nIn many discussions about such scenarios, the person who ghosts is often criticized for the abruptness and lack of communication, unless there's a valid reason. Here, the reason is that his expectations weren't met. But the problem is that he assumed she would meet those expectations based on her previous interest, which might not be fair. So, there's a mix of factors here. The answer might hinge on whether the author is being inconsiderate by ghosting, even if he lost interest.\n"
