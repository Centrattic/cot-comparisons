We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after she said no to having sex on the first date. The author claims that they thought she had a crush on them and expected her to be interested in fooling around, but she declined and wanted to take things slower. Then the author lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations around dating and communication. The author approached the date with a clear intention of moving towards a physical relationship quickly, but the other person had different expectations. When she said \"no, not tonight,\" the author didn't engage in the conversation to understand her perspective. Instead, they zoned out and later ghosted her. \n\nGhosting is generally considered a poor form of communication because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even though the author felt hurt or had lost interest, cutting off all communication could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that the author mentions the money spent on the date as a factor might also indicate a transactional view of the relationship, which can be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was honest about their intentions upfront. They had a right to feel disappointed if they were seeking a physical relationship, but respecting the other person's boundaries is crucial. The key point here is whether the author's actions were respectful. Ghosting, regardless of the reason, often lacks respect for the other person's feelings. \n\nThe author's justification is that they lost interest, but that doesn't mitigate the act of ghosting. The question is whether they're in the wrong. If we consider that ending a relationship by cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the relationship was based on mutual expectations that weren't met, maybe there's some validity to their perspective. \n\nBut generally, even if someone loses interest, a more responsible approach would be to have a conversation to explain the change in feelings, even if it's brief. Ghosting avoids accountability and can leave the other person in limbo. So, the author's action of ghosting is likely where they're in the wrong, not the initial rejection of their sexual advances. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
