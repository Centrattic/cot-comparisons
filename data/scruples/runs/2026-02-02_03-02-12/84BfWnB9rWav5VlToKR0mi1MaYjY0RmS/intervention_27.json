We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author explains that they had been flirting for a while, the girl had a crush, they went on a date, and he asked if they could go back to his place to fool around. She said no, he lost interest, and now he's ghosting her. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are consent, communication, and respect. The author approached the girl and asked directly if they could go back to his place. She declined. The author then lost interest and stopped responding. The question is whether this makes the author the asshole.\n\nIn terms of respect, if someone says no, then the proper response is to accept that and not push further. The author got a clear no, but then chose to ghost her instead of having a conversation. Ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person without closure. The author's motivation was that he lost interest because she didn't comply with his expectations. That's problematic because it shows that his interest was conditional on her agreeing to sex, which isn't a healthy basis for a relationship.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect is mentioned, where he feels like he wasted money. That's a red flag because valuing a relationship based on financial investment rather than mutual respect and emotional connection is not healthy. He's prioritizing his own desires and expenses over her boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is communication. After she said no, he didn't engage with her during the date and then ghosted. Instead of explaining his feelings or giving her a chance to discuss things, he just cut off contact. That's disrespectful and inconsiderate. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual effort, even when things don't go as planned.\n\nHowever, some might argue that he's within his right to lose interest if his expectations weren't met. But the issue here is that his interest was contingent on her agreeing to sex, which is not a valid reason to form a relationship. Also, the way he ended the interaction (ghosting) is the problem, not just his loss of interest.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to his feelings, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting after a clear no\u2014is inconsiderate and disrespectful. His actions don't align with healthy relationship behavior, so he's in the wrong.\n"
