We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nSo, the situation is the author asked Casey to go back to his place after their first date, and she declined. He mentions they've been flirting for a while and there were rumors she had feelings. He thought it was a done deal, but she said no and said she wanted things to develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies. He justifies it by not wanting to invest more time/money without getting what he wanted, and he feels he's not an asshole because he's honest and it's just about his loss of interest.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, respect, and expectations. The author approached Casey with a clear sexual request, and she declined. He then decided to cut off communication because she didn't meet his expectations. Now, while he's within his rights to not want to continue a relationship if his expectations aren't met, the way he's handling it might be problematic. Ghosting someone after they've expressed interest in continuing the relationship could be seen as dismissive and rude. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's not in the wrong because he's honest and the money he spent. But that's more about his own feelings and not considering Casey's perspective. She was clear she wanted to take things slower, which is a valid stance. The fact that the author is minimizing her feelings by saying he's not trying to hurt her but just lost interest suggests a lack of empathy. \n\nIn many cases, communication is key. If he was no longer interested, it would be better to have an honest conversation rather than ghosting. Ghosting can be hurtful regardless of the reason. The author's reasoning is selfish, prioritizing his own desires over her agency and his responsibility to communicate respectfully. So, I think the answer would be A, he's in the wrong. But maybe some people would say B because he's honest, but the act of ghosting is still considered antisocial. Yeah, I think A is correct here.\n"
