We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author asked Casey bluntly if they wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said \"no, not tonight,\" and emphasized that she wasn't \"like that,\" wanting to take things slower. The author then lost interest, ghosted her, and hasn't responded beyond minimal replies. He mentions he spent a lot of money on the date and felt it was a waste.\n\nNow, considering social norms and mutual respect in relationships. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can be hurtful. The author's main issue is that he expected a certain outcome (sexual activity) and when it didn't happen, he lost interest. That suggests his interest was conditional on physical intimacy, which might not be a solid foundation for a relationship. However, people have different expectations, and the author was upfront about his intentions. \n\nCasey, on the other hand, set boundaries and communicated her desire to take things slowly. The author's reaction\u2014ghosting\u2014could be seen as dismissive of her boundaries and emotions. Even if the author felt his expectations weren't met, the appropriate response would be to have an honest conversation rather than cut off communication.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the focus is on respecting the other person's autonomy and communication, then yes, the author is in the wrong for ghosting. However, if the focus is on personal choice regarding dating and expectations, some might argue he's not. But generally, respecting someone's no and maintaining communication is expected. Ghosting is usually considered the asshole move here because it's inconsiderate and lacks accountability. The author's justification about saving money and time isn't a valid reason to ghost. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
