When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative, left her estate to them. They had helped the play aunt by doing chores, and she was nice to them. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author to keep everything. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because these relatives weren't around, and they want to keep the inheritance.\n\nNow, the key points here. The will was made by the play aunt, so legally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives are contesting it, but they haven't approached the author directly. The author isn't legally obligated to give anything back unless the will is invalidated through legal means.\n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted because the relatives are upset. But considering that the relatives were distant and didn't take care of the play aunt, while the author and their family were there, it's understandable that the author might feel the inheritance was a just reward for their support.\n\nThe husband's advice is that it's up to the author. The question is whether the author is an asshole (in the WIBTA context) for keeping the inheritance. In the WIBTA context, people often look at both legal rights and moral obligations. Since the author wasn't expecting compensation and the play aunt explicitly left the inheritance, it's more about respecting her wishes. The relatives not being around doesn't necessarily make the author right, but in the WIBTA context, people often side with the person who followed the deceased's wishes, especially if the beneficiaries were close.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the will's instructions, and the relatives contesting it is their legal matter, not the author's responsibility unless proven otherwise.\n"
