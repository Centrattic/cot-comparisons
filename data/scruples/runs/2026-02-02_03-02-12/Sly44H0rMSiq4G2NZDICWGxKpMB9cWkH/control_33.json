When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The key points here are about the relationship dynamics, the expectations of the relatives, and the legality or fairness of the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they helped care for the play aunt along with their actual aunt, which involved tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They did this without expecting compensation, and the play aunt had a good relationship with them and their family. The play aunt left her estate to the author, which includes a home, car, and life insurance. The relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they haven't been involved in her life much. The author's actual aunt, who is the executor, thinks they should keep everything, and the author is considering doing so.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the author is named as a beneficiary, they have the right to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting might not have a strong legal case if they weren't close and didn't provide care, especially since the author and their aunt did. But legally, it's about the validity of the will and whether the relatives can prove undue influence or lack of capacity, which isn't mentioned here. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nEthically, the situation is a bit trickier. The author helped care for the play aunt, which might be seen as a reason for the bequest. The relatives weren't involved, so their potential resentment is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to share the inheritance just because relatives are upset. The author's husband also says it's up to them. Since the play aunt made her wishes clear in the will, obeying them doesn't make the author an asshole. They might feel annoyed because the relatives are now involved, but it's their right to follow the will's instructions.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
