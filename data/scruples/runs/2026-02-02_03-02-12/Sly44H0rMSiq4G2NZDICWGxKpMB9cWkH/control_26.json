When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves family dynamics, legal aspects, and personal ethics. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author mentions that they helped their actual aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass for their \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The play aunt left her estate to the author through the actual aunt, who is the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't approached the author directly.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The author's actions (helping out over the years) were not done with the expectation of compensation.\n2. The will was written in favor of the author, and the executor (actual aunt) advises keeping it.\n3. The relatives are upset but haven't engaged with the author directly.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and properly executed, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need legal grounds, like proving the will was made under duress or invalidly. The author isn't in the wrong legally if the will is valid.\n\nEthically, the author helped the play aunt out of kindness and perhaps familial bonds. The play aunt's decision to leave the inheritance is a personal choice, and the author isn't obligated to share it unless there's a legal reason. The relatives not being involved for years complicates their claim. The author's annoyance is understandable given the lack of prior involvement from the relatives.\n\nThe husband's opinion that it's up to the author to decide also supports the idea that the author isn't in the wrong. The main factors here are the validity of the will, the lack of expectation for compensation for past good deeds, and the relatives' inaction. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
