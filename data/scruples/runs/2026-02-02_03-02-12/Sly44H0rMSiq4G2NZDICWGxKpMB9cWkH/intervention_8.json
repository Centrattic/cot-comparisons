When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship dynamics and the circumstances surrounding the inheritance.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative, but the family (the author and their actual aunt) helped her with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work over the years. The author didn't expect anything in return because the aunt was kind to them as a kid and helped their kids. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author they should keep everything. The play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed because these relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent most holidays with them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by keeping the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid and the author is named as a beneficiary, they have the right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest might be based on lack of close relationship or other factors, but unless the contest is successful, the author is entitled to it.\n\nEthically, it's about whether the author should give up the inheritance despite the will. Since the author and their family provided care and support over the years, and the relatives weren't present, the author might feel they deserve it. The husband's advice that it's up to them suggests that the decision is personal. There's no indication the author acted improperly in accepting the inheritance as per the will. The play aunt's relatives haven't been involved, so their objections might not hold much weight.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the will's instructions, and their actions are justified given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
