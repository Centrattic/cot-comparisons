When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves the aunt's will, which left her property and money to the author. The key points here are the relationship between the author and the play aunt, the help the author and their family provided over the years, and the reaction of the play aunt's relatives.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work because they were close and lived nearby. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped with their children's college applications. The author didn't expect any compensation, which suggests a mutual, informal agreement based on kindness and support rather than any legal or financial expectation.\n\nThe play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. However, the author notes that these relatives weren't close to her and hadn't been around for years. The play aunt spent most of her holidays with the author's family. The executor, the author's actual aunt, supports the decision to leave the inheritance to the author. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting it would need to prove the will is invalid, which could be challenging if there's no evidence of undue influence or mental incapacity. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless the will is successfully contested, which isn't mentioned here as having happened.\n\nMoral considerations: The author provided care and support to the play aunt for years, which the relatives didn't. The play aunt chose to leave her assets to someone who was present in her life, which is a valid choice. The author isn't taking anything that wasn't freely given through the will. The husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide supports the idea that they aren't in the wrong.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that the relatives have a right to challenge the will if they believe it's unfair, but the author isn't at fault for following the will's instructions. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable given their lack of presence in the play aunt's life.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're following the play aunt's wishes, which were influenced by the long-term care and relationship they shared. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't negate the author's right to the inheritance as per the will.\n"
