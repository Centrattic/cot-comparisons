When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their play aunt.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author's actual aunt is the executor of a play aunt's estate. The play aunt, who wasn't a blood relative, left her property and money to the author. The play aunt had other relatives who weren't close to her, and they're upset about the will, possibly contesting it. The author feels they're not in the wrong because they and their family (including their actual aunt) helped take care of the play aunt over the years by doing chores, which wasn't a big hassle since they were nearby. The author didn't expect payment but now the inheritance is a point of contention.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The will was made by the deceased (play aunt) and she chose the author and their family. 2) The author's family had a long-term, helpful relationship with the play aunt, which might have influenced her decision. 3) The other relatives were not close and didn't participate in these caregiving activities. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and properly executed, the author has the right to the inheritance. The other relatives might contest the will, but unless there's evidence of fraud, undue influence, or some legal issue with the will's creation, the author is within their rights. \n\nMorally or socially, some might argue that the author should share, given that the relatives are upset. But the author might feel justified because their family provided care and support, and the play aunt had a closer relationship with them. The husband's stance that the author can decide if they want to give anything to the other relatives suggests that the author isn't obligated by their husband's perspective, which might reflect a common viewpoint in such situations.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the will is valid and the author is following the deceased's wishes, then they aren't in the wrong. The fact that the author didn't expect compensation but still received it complicates it, but the play aunt had the right to decide her own estate. The other relatives not being involved in the care could support the author's position. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
