When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation involves a non-blood relative, a will that leaves assets to the author, and relatives of the play aunt who are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Wills are legal documents, and if the play aunt clearly stated in her will that she wanted the property and money to go to the author, then legally, the author is entitled to it. Unless the will is invalid (which could be contested if there's evidence of undue influence, lack of mental capacity, etc.), the relatives have little legal standing. The author mentions that the relatives aren't close and didn't visit much, which might support the idea that the play aunt had the right to leave her assets to someone who was more present in her life.\n\nMoral considerations are a bit trickier. The author and their family provided care and support to the play aunt over the years without expecting anything in return. The play aunt's gratitude and the relationship they built might justify her decision to leave the inheritance. The author feels annoyed but not guilty because their contribution was genuine, and the relatives were absent. The husband's advice to the author to decide for themselves suggests that the decision is personal and not necessarily a moral wrong.\n\nThe key points are: the will was made by the deceased, the relatives weren't involved, and the author's family provided support. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless legally bound (which the relatives haven't proven yet). Emotionally, the author is conflicted but justified in feeling that they were the ones who were present and helpful.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They acted based on the deceased's wishes and their own genuine contributions without expecting anything, and the relatives' potential contest doesn't change that.\n"
