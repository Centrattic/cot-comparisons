When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" someone not related by blood. The key points here are the relationship between the narrator and the deceased, the actions the narrator and their family took (like helping with chores), and the inheritance left behind.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't blood-related, so there's no legal obligation for the inheritance. The narrator's family helped her out over the years, which the aunt appreciated. The executor of the estate, the narrator's actual aunt, is telling them to keep the inheritance. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The husband says it's up to the narrator to decide.\n\nThe main question is whether the narrator is in the wrong by not giving up the inheritance. Let's break it down. The will was made by the play aunt, who left everything to the narrator. If the will is valid, then the narrator is entitled to it. The relatives not being close and not being around much might be a factor. The narrator helped the aunt for years, which the aunt likely acknowledged by including them in the will. \n\nThe relatives' potential contesting could be a problem if the will is challenged. But unless the will is proven invalid, the narrator has a right to the inheritance. The narrator isn't obligated to share it unless there's some legal requirement, which there isn't here since they're not family. The annoyance at the relatives' involvement is understandable, especially since they weren't present in the aunt's life. \n\nSo, considering that the will was made with the intent to reward the narrator's long-term help, and the relatives weren't part of the aunt's life, the narrator isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
