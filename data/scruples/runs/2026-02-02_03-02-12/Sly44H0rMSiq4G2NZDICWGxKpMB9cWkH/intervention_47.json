When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt were helping the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work for years. They mention it wasn't a lot of extra work and they didn't expect payment. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped with things like college letters. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author they were left the inheritance. The play aunt's relatives, who weren't close, are upset and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed that these relatives are now involved, even though they weren't around much. The husband says it's up to the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was taken care of by the play aunt, helped her out without being paid, and she left them her estate. The relatives are not close. The author is considering keeping the inheritance as per the will. The question is whether they're in the wrong if they do that.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the author is a named beneficiary, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but unless there's evidence of undue influence or fraud, the will stands. The author wasn't acting out of greed; they had a relationship and provided care. The relatives weren't involved, so their potential contesting might not hold up. Morally, the author might feel they're justified in keeping it since they were the ones providing support. The play aunt's intentions, as expressed in her will, should matter. The author isn't obligated to redistribute unless there's a legal challenge. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly, the author's annoyance is understandable. The husband's support adds that the decision is up to the author. So overall, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
