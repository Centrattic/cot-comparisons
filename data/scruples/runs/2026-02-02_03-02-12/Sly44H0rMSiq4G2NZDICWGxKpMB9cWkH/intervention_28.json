When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to both the author's actual aunt and the author's family. The family helped care for the play aunt by doing chores, which wasn't a big hassle since they were nearby. The author didn't expect any payment, but the play aunt left her property and money to them. Now the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the will is valid and the relatives didn't have any legal standing to dispute it, then the author has a right to the inheritance. But maybe the will was made without proper legal formalities, like witnesses, which could be contested. However, the author's actual aunt is the executor, and she told them to keep it. So if the will is legally sound, the author is within their rights.\n\nNext, the moral angle. The author's family was close to the play aunt, helped her out, and she left them the inheritance. The relatives haven't been involved for years, and the play aunt spent time with the author's family. The author feels justified in keeping the inheritance because of their long-term relationship and the relatives' absence. The husband supports the author's decision. \n\nThe key points are the validity of the will and the relationship dynamics. If the relatives can't contest the will legally, then the author isn't wrong. If there's a legal challenge, that's a different scenario, but the author isn't obligated to give up what was left to them unless legally required. Morally, since the play aunt chose to leave it to them, the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the author's. The author isn't obligated to share unless they want to, and they have a valid relationship to justify keeping it. So the answer is B.\n"
