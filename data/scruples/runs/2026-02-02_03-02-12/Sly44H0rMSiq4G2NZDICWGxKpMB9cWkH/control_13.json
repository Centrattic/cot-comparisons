When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from the play aunt. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the user's actual aunt. The user and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and yard work over the years. The play aunt left her assets to the user through her will, which is managed by the actual aunt as the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her and hadn't visited much. The user feels annoyed because these relatives are now involved despite not being around, and they're considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nNow, the key points here are: The play aunt explicitly left the inheritance to the user. The relatives aren't close and weren't involved in her life. The user's family provided care and support over the years without expecting anything in return. The executor (actual aunt) thinks the user should keep it. The user is being asked if they're in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the play aunt had the mental capacity to make such a will, then the user is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not have a strong legal case if they weren't legally named in the will or if there's no evidence of undue influence. \n\nEthically, it's more about the user's intentions. Since the play aunt was close to the user's family and they provided support, it's reasonable that she would leave the inheritance to them. The user isn't obligated to share with distant relatives who weren't part of her life. The user's annoyance is understandable given the lack of involvement from the other relatives.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for following the play aunt's wishes as outlined in the will. The relatives' potential contest might not hold up legally, and the user's actions are in line with the deceased's expressed wishes. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
