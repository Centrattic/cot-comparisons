When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether they would be wrong to keep an inheritance left to them by a \"play aunt\" instead of possibly sharing it with her actual relatives. \n\nFirst, the context: The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, and the person helped her out over the years with chores, which were convenient since they were nearby. The real aunt is the executor and says the play aunt left everything to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the person is in the wrong by not forgoing the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid, the person is the rightful heir. The relatives would need to contest the will, which they haven't done directly to the person. \n\nEthically, it's trickier. The person felt they didn't owe compensation before, but the relatives might feel entitled. However, the play aunt chose to leave it to them, which was her right. The person's annoyance with the relatives not being around is a personal grievance. \n\nThe husband says it's up to them, and the person is conflicted. But since the will is in place and the relatives haven't taken legal action, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're following the deceased's wishes. Unless the will is invalid, they can't be blamed for accepting what was left to them. \n\nSo the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
