When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author and their family helped the play aunt with chores over the years, and now the play aunt left her estate to the author's actual aunt, who's the executor, and possibly to the author. The play aunt's actual relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and moral aspects here. Legally, if the will is valid, then the author isn't in the wrong for following the deceased's wishes. The relatives contesting might not have a strong case if they weren't close and the will is properly executed. Morally, the author has a history of helping the play aunt, so taking the inheritance as per her wishes could be justified. The author also mentions they didn't expect compensation before, so this was likely a gesture of gratitude from the play aunt.\n\nThe key points are: the will's validity, the relationship dynamics, and the author's intentions. The author isn't being greedy; they're following the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives were distant. The author's actions seem respectful of the deceased's intentions. So the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). But need to make sure there's no hidden ethical issue here. Maybe the relatives have rights, but the author isn't obligated to give them anything unless the will is contested successfully. Since the author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical beyond the will's terms, they're not in the wrong.\n"
