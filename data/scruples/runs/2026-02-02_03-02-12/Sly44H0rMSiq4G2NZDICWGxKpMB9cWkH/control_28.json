When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for accepting the inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their family did small chores for the play aunt, like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. These tasks weren't a huge burden since they were close by and took about 20-30 minutes extra. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was considered family. The author didn't expect any reward for these acts. \n\nWhen the play aunt passed away, her actual relatives (blood relatives) are upset because the estate was left to the author's actual aunt, who is the executor, and presumably to the author. The author is being pressured by their own aunt to keep everything, but the blood relatives are considering contesting the will. \n\nThe author feels annoyed that these distant relatives are now involved, especially since they weren't around much. They\u2019re considering keeping the inheritance, which includes money, a home, car, and life insurance. The husband says it's up to the author to decide.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The play aunt made a will that left her estate to the author's aunt and possibly the author. \n2. The author didn't expect any compensation for the chores done over the years.\n3. The blood relatives are not close and haven't been involved, but now they're upset and possibly contesting the will.\n4. The author is conflicted about whether keeping the inheritance makes them an \"asshole.\"\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the will is valid and the executor is following it, the author has a right to the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to leave her estate to whomever she chose. The fact that the author and their family helped out over the years might have strengthened the emotional bond, but that doesn't legally obligate them to give up the inheritance. However, ethically, maybe there's a consideration to the blood relatives. But since those relatives were not involved in the play aunt's life, the author might feel justified in honoring the play aunt's wishes. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong legally, but maybe the question is about being a \"WIBTA\"\u2014Would I Be a Total Asshole. The community might consider the author's actions, given that the play aunt chose them and the relatives weren't involved. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance if the will is valid. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
