When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is being asked if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt in question wasn't a blood relative, and the author helped her with chores along with their real aunt. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, but her actual relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author was named as a beneficiary, then legally, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting might not have a strong legal standing, especially if they weren't close and didn't participate in her care. In many jurisdictions, wills can be contested under certain conditions, like undue influence or lack of mental capacity, but just being a relative isn't enough. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's a bit murkier. The author helped the aunt with chores, which the aunt appreciated. The author didn't expect compensation, but the aunt left them the inheritance as a gesture of gratitude. The author's husband says it's up to them to decide if they want to give anything to the relatives. The author feels annoyed because the relatives weren't around, so they're not inclined to share. \n\nThe key points here are intent and fairness. The author wasn't expecting anything but was left the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest might be seen as taking advantage now, especially if they weren't involved in her life. The author's argument is that the will reflects the aunt's wishes, and since the relatives weren't part of her care, it's not their responsibility to share. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that even if the relatives are distant, they have a legal claim if they can contest the will. But since the author has the legal right through the will, unless there's a valid legal challenge, they aren't at fault. Ethically, the author isn't obligated to share unless they choose to. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the will's instructions, and the relatives' actions might not hold up legally or ethically given their lack of involvement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
