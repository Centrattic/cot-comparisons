When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who left her property and money to the author. The author has been helping the aunt with chores for years. The actual aunt is the executor and advises the author to keep everything, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The will was written by the play aunt, and the author is a beneficiary. If the will is valid and properly executed, legally the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not have a strong case if the will is in order. But the author is feeling conflicted because the relatives weren't close and the author feels they don't deserve the inheritance.\n\nEthically, the author is being criticized for not sharing the inheritance. However, the author didn't expect compensation for helping the aunt. There's a sense of obligation here, but the author was doing favors without expecting anything. The play aunt's relatives weren't around, so maybe the author's family was the closest support. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author was doing unpaid work, the will is in their favor, and the relatives were distant. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's more about personal values. The author is being advised by their husband to decide based on their own judgment. The actual aunt supports keeping the inheritance, which suggests that the play aunt's wishes are respected. \n\nThe relatives' potential to contest might be a red herring if the will is valid. The author isn't obligated to share unless they choose to. Since the author didn't expect anything and the play aunt explicitly left them the estate, there's no inherent wrongdoing in the author following her wishes. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
