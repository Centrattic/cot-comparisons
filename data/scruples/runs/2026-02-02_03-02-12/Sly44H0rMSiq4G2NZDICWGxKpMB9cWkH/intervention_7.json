When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author and their family. They helped her with chores over the years, and she was nice to them. She left her estate to the author through her actual aunt, who's the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been around much. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are involved now after not being present for years.\n\nSo, the author is being asked if keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole. The key points here are the will's validity and the intentions of the deceased. Since the play aunt left the estate to the author, and the author's aunt is the executor, the author is following her wishes. The relatives' potential contest is a legal matter, but if the will is valid, the author has a right to the inheritance.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they provided care and support over the years and weren't expecting anything in return. The relatives weren't close, so the play aunt's decision to leave the estate to the author makes sense. The author's annoyance at the relatives' sudden interest is valid, given their lack of prior involvement.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't obligated to give up what was intentionally left to them. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't grant them a right to the inheritance unless the will is legally challenged successfully. Since the author is acting on the deceased's wishes and the relatives were absent, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
