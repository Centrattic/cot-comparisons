When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The situation is that the aunt left her property and money to the author, and the relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed because they've done favors for the aunt over the years, and now the relatives are getting involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the executor (the author's actual aunt) is following it, then legally the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting the will\u2014how serious is that? If they can't prove the will is invalid (like undue influence, lack of mental capacity), then the author is within their rights to keep it. \n\nThen there's the moral side. The author's family helped the aunt without expecting anything. The aunt was close to them and not the relatives. The author's husband says it's their decision. The author is considering giving the relatives some stuff but not the main assets. \n\nI think the key points are the validity of the will and the intentions of the decedent. The author was treated well by the aunt, and the will reflects her wishes. The relatives weren't present, so the aunt's choice to leave it to the author makes sense. Unless there's legal grounds to contest, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
