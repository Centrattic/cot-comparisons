When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author was doing small favors for their \"play aunt,\" like shoveling snow and cutting grass. The play aunt isn't a blood relative, but the author's actual aunt is the executor. The play aunt left her property and money to the author. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance.\n\nSo, the main question is about the author's right to keep it versus the relatives' claims. The author didn't expect compensation for the help they provided, but the play aunt chose to leave them the inheritance. The relatives weren't close, hadn't visited much, and the play aunt spent time with the author's family instead.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the author should be able to keep it. The problem is more about ethics. The author is being called an \"asshole\" by the relatives, but they're not blood relatives either. The author's husband says it's up to them. The key points are: the author didn't ask for the inheritance, the play aunt made her own choice, and the relatives weren't involved much. \n\nThe author might feel justified since they provided care and the play aunt appreciated them. The relatives' potential contesting is a legal matter, but morally, if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong. They might feel a moral obligation to share, but since the play aunt explicitly left it to them, they're not obligated. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B. The author isn't in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' lack of involvement makes their claim weaker.\n"
