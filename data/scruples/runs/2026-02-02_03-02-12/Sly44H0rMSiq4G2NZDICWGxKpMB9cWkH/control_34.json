When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the play aunt isn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt did favors for her, like shoveling snow and cutting grass. These were small tasks, adding maybe 20-30 minutes extra. The author didn't expect payment, as the aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college stuff. So there's a history of mutual support.\n\nThe play aunt had relatives who weren't close. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author they were left the estate. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed because the relatives weren't around, while they spent time with the aunt. They're considering keeping everything, and their husband says it's their choice.\n\nNow, the author's dilemma is whether they're wrong for keeping the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives might have a case if they can prove the will is invalid, but the author isn't obligated to give up what was left to them unless there's a legal challenge.\n\nMorally, the author might feel conflicted, but they were close to the aunt and contributed to her care. The relatives weren't involved, so the author's relationship was more active. The question is about being in the wrong. Since the author followed the will's instructions and there's no indication they did anything illegal or unethical beyond that, they probably aren't in the wrong. The key here is the validity of the will and the intentions of the deceased. The relatives' potential contest doesn't necessarily make the author wrong unless they acted improperly.\n"
