When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship dynamics and the context of the inheritance.\n\nFirst, the \"play aunt\" is not a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. The author and their family helped the play aunt with chores, which was part of a long-standing arrangement. The author didn't expect payment, which is important because it shows there was no quid pro quo for the inheritance. \n\nThe play aunt left her estate to the author, and her relatives are upset. The author is considering keeping it, feeling that the relatives weren't around much. The husband supports the author's decision, and the executor (the actual aunt) also thinks the author should keep it. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives don't contest it successfully, the author is entitled to the inheritance. Ethically, the question is whether the author's actions are wrong. The author's family had a close relationship with the play aunt, to the point where she spent holidays with them, which might give them a stronger claim in terms of the play aunt's intentions. \n\nThe relatives' potential contest is mentioned, but the author hasn't been approached directly, and they're annoyed by their involvement now. The author's annoyance is understandable given the long-term support and the lack of prior presence from the relatives. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge. Since the relatives haven't initiated any legal action, and the will is in place, the author is within their rights. The fact that the author didn't expect anything in return for their help further supports the idea that the inheritance is a personal decision, not a transactional one. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're honoring the play aunt's wishes as per the will, and the relatives' objections don't override that unless there's a legal ruling against it. The author's decision is based on the play aunt's expressed wishes and the actual relationship they had, which seems fair under the circumstances.\n"
