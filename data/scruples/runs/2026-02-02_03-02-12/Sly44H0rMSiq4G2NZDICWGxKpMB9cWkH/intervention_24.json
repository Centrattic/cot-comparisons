When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance left to them by their \"play aunt.\" The author mentions that they didn't expect compensation for the help they and their actual aunt provided over the years, like shoveling snow or cutting grass. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close, and she left her estate to the author. However, the play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is annoyed because these relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent most holidays with them. They're considering keeping the inheritance but offering family photos and such.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the play aunt's will is valid and she legally left everything to the author, then legally, the author is in the right. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally. The user probably wants to know if it's considered unethical or socially unacceptable to keep the inheritance despite the relatives' objections.\n\nThe play aunt's relatives haven't been involved in her life for years, and the author's family was the one providing care. The relatives might feel entitled, especially if they believe there's a legal claim, but if they weren't present, it's hard to say they have a moral right. The author isn't legally obligated to give up the inheritance unless the will is contested in court. Legally, the author has a claim through the will, which the executor (the actual aunt) is supporting.\n\nNow, the author's intentions matter. They didn't expect compensation, which shows they were helping out of kindness, not for financial gain. The relatives' anger might be about feeling left out or not being considered in the will, even if they weren't close. The author is conflicted because they don't want to be an asshole but also feel it's fair based on the play aunt's wishes and their family's long-term support.\n\nMorally, the author isn't in the wrong because the play aunt had the right to decide her estate. The relatives are within their legal rights to contest if they can prove the will is invalid, but the author isn't obligated to give them anything beyond what they offer (like family pictures). The annoyance from the author is understandable given their history with the play aunt.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' objections don't necessarily make them right to take it. The author's actions are justified based on the long-term care and the will's terms.\n"
