When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The setup is that the author, along with their actual aunt, helped care for their \"play aunt\" by doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. The play aunt isn't related by blood, but the actual aunt is the executor of her estate and was told by the play aunt to leave everything to the author. The play aunt's own relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been close for years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the play aunt clearly stated the author should inherit, then legally, the author isn't in the wrong. The question is about morality, though. The author feels they were genuinely helping and didn't expect anything in return. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The author's husband supports their decision, and the actual aunt agrees to let them keep the inheritance. \n\nThe relatives are upset but haven't been around. The author is annoyed that they're involved now. The key points are the intent behind the help, the will's validity, and the relatives' lack of involvement. Since the author had no expectation of reward and the play aunt's wishes are clear, morally, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest might not hold if the will is legally sound. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
