When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt were doing chores for the play aunt, and now the play aunt left her estate to the author. The relatives are unhappy and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will is valid and the executor (the actual aunt) is administering it properly, then the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The relatives talking about contesting might not hold up if the will is properly executed. But maybe there's a question about undue influence or if the will was made properly. The user didn't mention any issues there, so I should assume the will is valid.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author didn't expect compensation, but the play aunt chose to leave them the inheritance. The author feels they've been more supportive over the years compared to the relatives. The husband says it's up to the author. The author is conflicted because they're annoyed the relatives are involved now but weren't present before.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for taking the inheritance? Well, if the will is valid, then legally they're not. Morally, if the relatives are upset but weren't part of the play aunt's life, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The play aunt's wishes are to give to the author, so respecting that might be the right choice. However, contesting might come down to legal standing, not just being upset. If the relatives have no legal grounds, then the author is safe. But if the will is contested successfully, the author might need to share. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the legal outcome.\n\nThe user's main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is following the will's instructions and the relatives weren't involved, the answer is likely B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for obeying the play aunt's wishes, especially given the long-term support and the executor's confirmation.\n"
