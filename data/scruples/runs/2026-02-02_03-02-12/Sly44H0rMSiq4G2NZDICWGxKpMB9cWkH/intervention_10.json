When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. The key points are: the play aunt wasn't a blood relative, they helped her over the years, the actual aunt (executor) told them they were named in the will, and the play aunt's other relatives are upset but hadn't been close.\n\nFirst, the author didn't expect anything in return for helping, which is a big point. They felt it was a kindness, not a transaction. The will explicitly states their inheritance, so legally they have a right to it. The relatives are contesting it, but they weren't involved in her life. The author's husband says it's up to them. \n\nMoral considerations: The author has a history of support and care. The play aunt chose to leave her estate to someone who was part of her life. The relatives not being close might mean their claim isn't as valid. The author's annoyance is understandable given the lack of involvement. \n\nLegally, the will is valid unless contested successfully. But morally, the author has a strong case. They were included because of their relationship and contributions. The relatives' anger seems misplaced if they weren't present. The author isn't obligated to give up what was clearly intended for them. So, the answer is B.\n"
