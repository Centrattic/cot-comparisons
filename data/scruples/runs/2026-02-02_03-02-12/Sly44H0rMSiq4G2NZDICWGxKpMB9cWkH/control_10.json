When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person is called a \"play aunt,\" not a blood relative. The user and their family helped her with chores because she lived near their actual aunt. They didn't expect payment because she was nice and helped the user's kids. The play aunt left her estate to the user through the executor (their actual aunt). The relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they haven't been involved much. The user feels annoyed about this and is considering keeping the inheritance, while their husband says the decision is up to them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the user had a close, helpful relationship with the play aunt; the relatives were distant; the will left everything to the user. The question is about whether the user is wrong to keep the inheritance as per the will.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives aren't challenging it successfully, the user has the right to the inheritance. But morally, maybe there's a question. However, the user didn't make a secret agreement; the play aunt chose to leave the inheritance to them. The relatives weren't involved in her daily life, so it's possible the play aunt intended the user to get it. The user isn't doing anything illegal, and the will reflects her wishes. Unless there's evidence of undue influence or the will is contested successfully, the user isn't in the wrong. Also, the user isn't obligated to share with distant relatives who weren't part of her life. So, the answer is B.\n"
