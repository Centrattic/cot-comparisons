When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who was close to the author's actual aunt. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, and the relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and their family helped care for the play aunt over the years, doing small tasks like snow shoveling and yard work. The play aunt had no kids, and her real relatives weren't close. The actual aunt is the executor and wants the author to keep everything. The play aunt's relatives are unhappy but haven't approached the author directly. The author is considering keeping the inheritance but feels annoyed about the relatives' involvement.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for keeping the inheritance as per the will. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to leave her assets to anyone she chose, including the author who helped her. The relatives' potential contesting the will might not hold if the will is properly executed. \n\nThe author's feelings of annoyance are understandable since the relatives weren't around. The author isn't obligated to give them anything unless the will's validity is challenged. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly, there's no pressure to negotiate. The husband's advice to decide for themselves aligns with the author's right to accept the inheritance as intended by the play aunt.\n\nMoral considerations: The author helped the play aunt, who clearly appreciated them enough to leave the inheritance. The relatives' absence over the years suggests they weren't involved in her care, so expecting a share might be less justified. However, if the will is contested, the author might need to defend the bequest, but legally, that's their right.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' objections don't override the valid will. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
