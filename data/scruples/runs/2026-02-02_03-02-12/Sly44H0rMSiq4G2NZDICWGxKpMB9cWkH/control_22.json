When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance. The situation is that the \"play aunt\" left her property and money to the author, who is the niece of the executor (the actual aunt). The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the author is properly named as a beneficiary, then legally, they have a right to the inheritance. The post mentions that the executor (the actual aunt) supports keeping everything, so maybe the will is valid. If the relatives contest, they might need to prove the will is invalid, which could be difficult if they weren't close and weren't involved in her life recently.\n\nMoral and ethical considerations: The author and her family helped the play aunt with chores for years, forming a close relationship. The relatives were distant. The author feels justified in keeping the inheritance because of their support and the play aunt's clear wishes as per the will. The husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide supports that the author isn't obligated to give anything unless they choose to.\n\nThe relatives might argue that they have a familial claim, but if they were not involved, the author's argument is stronger. The key here is the intent of the deceased, as expressed in the will. If the play aunt wanted the author to have it, and the will reflects that, then the author isn't in the wrong for following her wishes. The relatives' potential contesting is a legal matter they'd need to pursue, but unless they have legal grounds, the author is in the right to keep the inheritance.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
