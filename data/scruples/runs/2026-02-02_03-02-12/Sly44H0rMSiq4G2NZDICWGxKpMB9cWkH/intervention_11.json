When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance left to them by their \"play aunt.\" The play aunt isn't a blood relative, and the author's actual aunt is the executor of her estate. The key points here are the relationship, the actions taken (like helping with chores), and whether the author should keep the inheritance despite the relatives' displeasure.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they helped the play aunt by doing tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass, which were manageable and in exchange for nothing expected. The play aunt was helpful to their kids and the author's actual aunt. The relatives didn't visit much and weren't close, so the author feels justified in keeping the inheritance as per the will. The executor, the actual aunt, supports keeping it, and the husband also says it's up to the author. The relatives might contest the will, but they haven't approached the author directly.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the author is a beneficiary, they aren't obligated to give it up unless there's a legal challenge. Since the relatives haven't approached them directly, the author isn't in a position to negotiate. Ethically, the author's actions (helping out without expecting payment) might have built a relationship that justified the inheritance from the aunt's perspective. The fact that the relatives were distant and the play aunt chose to include the author in her will suggests that the author's intentions were not to gain wealth but to maintain a helpful relationship.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the will's instructions, and there's no indication of wrongdoing. The relatives' potential contest doesn't change the author's right to the inheritance. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
