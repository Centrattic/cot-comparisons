When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt wasn't a blood relative, but they helped take care of the aunt and her actual relative.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their family did chores for the play aunt and her actual aunt, which wasn't too much extra work. The play aunt left her property and money to the author. The relatives of the play aunt are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping it, and their husband says it's their decision.\n\nThe key points here: The author was not expecting compensation but helped out of kindness and proximity. The play aunt had a relationship with them, and her actual aunt (the executor) is supporting the will's decision. The relatives weren't close, didn't visit much, and now they're upset. The author feels annoyed because the relatives are involved now, even though they weren't around.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the executor is following it, the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance. The relatives might contest, but unless there's evidence of undue influence or the will being invalid, the author isn't at fault. Emotionally, the author might feel conflicted because they helped the aunt, and the relatives weren't involved. The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless the will says so, which it doesn't. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
