When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author's actual aunt is the executor and told them they were left the estate. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the author was named in the will, unless there's a legal issue with the will itself, they have a right to the inheritance. The relatives haven't officially contested it yet, just talked about it. So legally, the author might be okay.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author didn't expect anything but was given the inheritance. They did favors for the play aunt, but didn't expect payment. Now, the relatives are upset because they weren't close. The author feels annoyed because they were the ones who actually spent time with the play aunt. The husband says it's up to them. \n\nThe key points here are the intentions of the deceased. If the play aunt wanted to leave everything to the author, then morally, the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest might be based on their own feelings of entitlement, but if the will is valid, the author is following the deceased's wishes. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could consider sharing some of the inheritance to prevent conflict, but that's not necessarily their obligation. The question is whether they're \"in the wrong\" by taking the inheritance. Since the will was executed properly and the author was the one the play aunt chose, I think they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
