When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original question) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. The situation involves a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. The actual aunt is the executor of the play aunt's estate and has given the property and money to the author. The play aunt's relatives are unhappy and might contest the will, but they weren't really close to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the play aunt intended to leave the inheritance to the author, then legally, the author has the right to it. The relatives might contest it, but unless there's evidence of the will being invalid, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nThen there's the moral question. The author helped take care of the play aunt, which others didn't do. The relatives weren't around, so it's possible the play aunt made a conscious decision to reward the author's help. The author isn't obligated to share unless they feel morally compelled. The husband's advice supports the author's right to decide.\n\nAnother angle is the relatives' potential contest. If they contest and fail, they might take it out on the author, but that's beyond their control. The author isn't at fault for following the deceased's wishes. The annoyance the author feels is understandable given the relatives' lack of presence.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because the inheritance was left to them as per the will, and they provided care to the play aunt when others didn't. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't change the legal or moral standing here. So the answer should be B.\n"
