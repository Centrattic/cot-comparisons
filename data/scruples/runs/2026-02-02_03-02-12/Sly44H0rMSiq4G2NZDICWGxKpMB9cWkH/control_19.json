When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo, the author's \"play aunt,\" who's not a blood relative, passed away. The author and their family helped take care of her over the years, like doing chores. The play aunt left her property and money to the author through the executor, their actual aunt. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed because these relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent most holidays with them. The husband says it's up to the author. The question is if the author is in the wrong if they just take the inheritance as per the will.\n\nFirst, legally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives would need to contest the will in court. If the will is properly executed, the author isn't doing anything wrong by accepting it.\n\nMoral-wise, the author helped care for the play aunt, and the play aunt left them the inheritance. The relatives weren't present, so it's possible the play aunt intended this. The author isn't obligated to share unless legally required. The annoyance comes from the relatives' sudden interest after being absent. The author's actions are based on the play aunt's wishes as expressed in the will. Unless there's a legal challenge that's successful, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
