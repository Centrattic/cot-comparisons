When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the \"play aunt\" wasn't a blood relative but was close to the actual aunt. The author's family, including the actual aunt, helped the play aunt with chores like snow shoveling and lawn care for years. They didn't expect payment because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college letters. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through her will. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is annoyed these relatives are involved now, even though they weren't around before. The husband says it's up to the author to decide if they want to give anything to the relatives.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's family provided unpaid help over the years, the play aunt chose to leave her estate to the author, and the relatives are now unhappy. The author is wondering if keeping the inheritance makes them an asshole.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author is entitled to the inheritance. There's no legal obligation to give them anything unless the will specifies otherwise. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nMorally or ethically, it's more complex. The author's family helped the play aunt, and she reciprocated by leaving them the inheritance. The relatives weren't involved, so their absence might mean they didn't contribute. However, some might argue that the relatives have a rightful claim, but if they weren't part of the play aunt's life, that could weaken their moral claim. The author might feel they have a stronger connection through the years of help. \n\nThe play aunt's decision to leave everything to the author is a personal choice, and the author is following her wishes. Unless there's a legal challenge that succeeds, the author is within their rights. The relatives' annoyance is their problem, and the author isn't obligated to give them anything unless they choose to out of goodwill.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
