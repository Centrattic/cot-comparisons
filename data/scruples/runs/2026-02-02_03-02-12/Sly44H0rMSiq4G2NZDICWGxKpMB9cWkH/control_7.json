When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The situation involves a \"play aunt\" who left her estate to the author, and her relatives are upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like snow shoveling and gardening. They did it as a favor, not expecting payment. The play aunt was close to them, even helping with college stuff for the author's kids. She had relatives, but they weren't close, and they didn't visit much.\n\nThe key here is the will. The play aunt explicitly left everything to the author. Legally, unless the relatives can contest the will successfully (which would require proving, for example, that she was unduly influenced or the will is invalid), the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives are upset but have only talked to the executor, not the author. The author feels annoyed because the relatives weren't around, and she's inclined to keep what she was given.\n\nEthically, even if the relatives are upset, the play aunt made her own decision. The author acted as a caregiver, and the relatives were negligent. The law typically respects a person's right to leave their estate as they choose. So the author isn't in the wrong for following the will. The answer should be B (No).\n"
