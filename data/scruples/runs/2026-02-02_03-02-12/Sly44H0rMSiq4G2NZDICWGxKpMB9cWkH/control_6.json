When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance. The situation involves a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores for years without expecting anything in return. The play aunt left her estate to the author's actual aunt, who then passed it on to the author. Now the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is the named beneficiary, legally they are entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need valid grounds, like the will being invalid due to undue influence, lack of capacity, etc. But the author mentions that the relatives haven't been around for years. So if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong legally.\n\nMorally, the author helped the play aunt and her actual aunt for years. The play aunt didn't have kids, and the author and their family were close. The author doesn't owe the relatives anything because they weren't involved in the play aunt's life. The relatives didn't contribute, so expecting a share might not be fair. The author's husband says it's up to them, which suggests there's no obligation to share.\n\nThe key points here are the validity of the will, the relationship dynamics, and the contributions made. Since the author wasn't expecting compensation and the play aunt clearly intended to leave the inheritance to them, the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the author's. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
