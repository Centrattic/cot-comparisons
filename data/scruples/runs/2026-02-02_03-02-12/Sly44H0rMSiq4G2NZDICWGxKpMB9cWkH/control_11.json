When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA question is in the wrong. The scenario involves an inheritance. The key points here are the relationships, the actions taken, and the legal/ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the author refers to the deceased as their \"play aunt,\" not a blood relative. She wasn't related by blood but was close to the author's actual aunt. The author and their family did chores for her and the actual aunt, which wasn't a big effort. The author didn't expect compensation but did it out of kindness and because the play aunt was helpful to them.\n\nThe actual aunt, as the executor, informed the author they were left the property and money. The play aunt's relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The author is conflicted because they feel the relatives weren't around, and they want to keep the inheritance.\n\nNow, the main question: Is the author in the wrong for keeping the inheritance? Let's consider the factors. Legally, if the will is valid and the author is named as a beneficiary, they have the right to the inheritance. The relatives' potential contest would depend on legal grounds, like if the will was made under undue influence or if there are formalities not met. But the author isn't doing anything illegal by following the will.\n\nEthically, the author might feel they were deserving because of the care provided. The relatives weren't present, so the deceased's choice to give to the author could be seen as a valid decision. The author isn't obligated to share unless legally required. The husband's advice supports the author's autonomy in the decision.\n\nHowever, some might argue about fairness to the blood relatives, but the deceased had the right to leave her assets as she wished. The author's actions align with her wishes, so they're not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
