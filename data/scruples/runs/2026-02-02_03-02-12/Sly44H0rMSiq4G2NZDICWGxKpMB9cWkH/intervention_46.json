When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't a blood relative. The person (author) helped take care of the play aunt by doing chores, and she left her estate to them. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they hadn't been around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the author was named in the will and the executor (the actual aunt) is supporting them, legally, the author has a right to the inheritance unless the will is successfully contested. The relatives haven't talked to the author directly, just expressed their intent to contest to the executor. But if they don't have a valid legal claim (maybe due to not being close or the will being properly drawn up), their contest might not hold. So legally, the author is probably fine.\n\nOn the moral side, the author helped care for the play aunt, and she appreciated them. The relatives weren't involved. The author feels they were given the inheritance as a gesture of gratitude. The husband supports the author's decision. The relatives' reaction seems to be more about their own feelings of entitlement rather than actual contributions. So morally, the author isn't in the wrong. They were recognized for their care and support, which the play aunt valued.\n\nThe key points here are the legal validity of the will, the contribution of the author, and the lack of presence from the relatives. The author isn't obligated to give up the inheritance, especially since the play aunt chose to leave it to them. The relatives contesting might not be justified if the will is valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
