When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance left to them by their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the nature of the inheritance, and the possible legal and moral implications.\n\nFirst, the author refers to the deceased as a \"play aunt,\" meaning no blood relation. They and their actual aunt lived nearby and helped with chores. The author didn't expect payment for these tasks, as the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. Now, the play aunt left her estate to the author through her actual aunt, the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her and hadn't visited much. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are now involved after not being around. Their husband says it's up to them to decide if they give anything to the relatives.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by taking the inheritance. Legally, if the will is valid and the author is named as a beneficiary, they have the right to the inheritance unless there's a valid contest. Since the relatives haven't approached the author directly and the will was executed through the proper executor, legally the author might be in the right. \n\nMoral considerations: The author didn't expect compensation for helping, but the play aunt's wishes via the will are clear. The relatives weren't involved, so the author might feel justified in following the will. However, some might argue that the relatives could have a claim, but since they weren't close, the author's argument is stronger. The author's husband supports their decision, which adds to their confidence.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say the author should share the inheritance out of goodwill, but the author isn't obligated to do so. The will reflects the deceased's wishes, and the relatives' potential contestation doesn't necessarily make the author wrong if the will holds up.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because they followed the will's instructions, and the relatives weren't close. The legal standing is on their side, and morally, the author's relationship with the play aunt was more active. So the answer is B.\n"
