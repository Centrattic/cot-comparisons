When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt did some chores for the play aunt over the years, like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The play aunt left her property and money to the author, and the actual aunt is the executor. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they weren't close to her. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, as they didn't expect anything for their help and the relatives weren't around much.\n\nFirst, I need to check the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the play aunt clearly stated that the author should inherit, then legally, the author has the right to keep it. The relatives can contest the will, but if they weren't legally close and the will is properly executed, their contest might not hold up. But maybe there's something else? Like, maybe the play aunt didn't have the mental capacity when making the will, or there was undue influence? The author mentions the relatives talked to the actual aunt about contesting, but not to them. So maybe the legal standing is on the author's side.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author helped out for years without expecting payment. The play aunt was nice to them and their kids, and the author feels that the relatives weren't around. The author is annoyed that the relatives are now involved. Is there a moral obligation to share the inheritance? The husband says it's up to the author. The author isn't in it for the money, just following the play aunt's wishes. The relatives weren't involved in her care, so maybe morally, it's okay to keep it.\n\nAlso, the play aunt's relatives aren't blood relatives, just mentioned as some relatives. The author did the chores out of kindness, and the play aunt's gratitude was shown through helping their kids with college letters, etc. The author didn't take the inheritance for a reward but because the play aunt wanted to. So if the will is valid, the author is just following the deceased's wishes, which is morally right.\n\nPutting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The inheritance was left as per the will, and the relatives not being close might mean they don't have a solid claim. The author's actions align with the play aunt's intentions, and there's no indication of wrongdoing on their part. So the answer should be B.\n"
