When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong here. The scenario is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who isn't a blood relative. The main question is whether the author (the person who asked the WIBTA question) is wrong for not giving up the inheritance.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The play aunt lived near the user's actual aunt, and they were friends. The user and their family did chores for the play aunt because they were nearby and it wasn't much extra work. The play aunt left her property and money to the user, and the actual aunt is the executor. The relatives of the play aunt are unhappy and might contest the will, but they weren't close and hadn't been around. The user is considering keeping the inheritance, and the husband says it's up to them. The user is annoyed at the relatives' involvement now.\n\nThe key points here are the legal aspect and the moral/ethical aspect. Legally, if the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives talking to the executor but not the author might not be enough to challenge the will, especially if they don't have legal grounds. The play aunt's will was made with the intention to leave everything to the author, so unless there's a legal issue, the author is within their rights.\n\nMoral/ethically, it could be seen as the author being ungrateful if they take the inheritance, but given that the play aunt was close to them and the relatives weren't involved, the author might feel it's justified. The author also mentions that they didn't expect compensation and weren't doing chores for money. The relatives' lack of presence over the years might make the author's decision more reasonable.\n\nI should consider if there's any obligation to share the inheritance. If the relatives are blood relatives, sometimes there's an expectation, but in this case, the play aunt wasn't related to the author either. The key is that the play aunt chose to leave it to the author, and the relatives didn't contribute to her care. The author's annoyance at the relatives' involvement now is valid if they were absent for a long time.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're following the play aunt's wishes, and the relatives' potential contest might not hold up. The answer should be B.\n"
