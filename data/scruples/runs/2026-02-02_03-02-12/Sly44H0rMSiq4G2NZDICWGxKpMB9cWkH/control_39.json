When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received. So, the situation is that the person's \"play aunt\" left her property and money to them. The play aunt isn't a blood relative, but they did some chores for her over the years with their actual aunt. The play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will is valid and legally binding, then the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives would need to challenge the will in court to change that. But contesting a will can be difficult, especially if there's no evidence of undue influence or that the aunt wasn't of sound mind when making the will. The author didn't expect any compensation for the chores, which might be a factor, but the will is a separate matter.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author mentions that they didn't expect anything for their help and that the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped with their kids. The relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent more time with the author's family. So, from a moral standpoint, the author might feel justified in accepting the inheritance, especially since the relatives weren't close.\n\nThe husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide if they want to give anything to the relatives adds another layer. The author is considering not giving anything, which might be seen as selfish if the relatives have a claim, but if they weren't close, maybe it's not. \n\nI need to check if there's any legal obligation here. If the will was properly executed and the relatives have no legal grounds to contest it, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the will was improperly made, maybe there's a case. However, the question is more about whether the author is morally in the wrong, not just legally.\n\nAlso, the author's annoyance at the relatives getting involved now after years of absence is a key point. They might feel the relatives don't deserve the inheritance after not being present in the play aunt's life. The author could argue that the play aunt made a conscious choice to leave things to them, which respects her wishes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong if the will is valid and they're following her wishes. The answer would be B (No).\n"
