When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the WIBTA scenario) is in the wrong for accepting an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" and not giving it to the relatives who are upset.\n\nFirst, the key points: The play aunt wasn't blood-related but was close to the author's actual aunt. They did chores for both aunts, which wasn't too much work. The relatives weren't around much, and the play aunt spent most holidays with the author's family. The actual aunt, as executor, told the author they were the beneficiary. The relatives are considering contesting the will but didn't talk to the author directly.\n\nThe author feels they were treated like family and did favors without expecting payment. They're annoyed the relatives are coming forward now. The husband says it's up to them to decide.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives aren't named in it, the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but if they weren't close and the play aunt chose to leave her assets to someone else who took care of her, that's her right. The author isn't obligated to give them anything unless the will is invalid or there's a legal obligation. \n\nMorally, some might argue the author should share, but the author isn't in a blood relation and the relatives were distant. The author's family provided care, so the play aunt's choice makes sense. The author isn't in the wrong for following the will's instructions unless there's a legal reason to think the will isn't valid. The answer would be B, No.\n"
