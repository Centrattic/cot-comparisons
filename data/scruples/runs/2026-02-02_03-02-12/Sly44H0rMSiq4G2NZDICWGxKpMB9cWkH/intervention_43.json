When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves inheritance and a family situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author helped out their \"play aunt\" along with their actual aunt by doing small tasks like shoveling snow and cutting grass. The play aunt isn't a blood relative but was a friend to their actual aunt. The author didn't expect anything in return because the play aunt was kind to them as a kid and helped their kids. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author through their actual aunt, who is the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed that the relatives are getting involved now after not being around for years.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they keep the inheritance. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The play aunt left the inheritance to the author. The relatives are unhappy but haven't approached the author directly. The author helped the play aunt a lot over the years. The key points here are the relationship between the author and the play aunt, the intentions of the play aunt when making the will, and the legal standing of the relatives contesting the will.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the play aunt had the mental capacity to make it, then the author is entitled to the inheritance unless the will is successfully contested. The relatives haven't taken legal action, just talking about it. The author isn't doing anything illegal by keeping what was left to them.\n\nMoral or social considerations: Did the author expect the inheritance? They mention not expecting compensation because the play aunt was nice to them and they helped out. But the play aunt still left them the inheritance. The author feels they were there for the play aunt more than the relatives were, so it's possible the play aunt intended for them to have it. The author's annoyance at the relatives coming forward now might stem from feeling that the relatives weren't there when it mattered.\n\nThe author's husband says it's up to them. The main issue is whether keeping the inheritance makes the author an \"asshole.\" If the play aunt intended for the author to have it, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the relatives have a legitimate claim and the will is invalid, then maybe they are. However, the author isn't at fault for the relatives' potential grievances. The author followed the play aunt's wishes as conveyed by the executor.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (author is not in the wrong). The author isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless legally required, and the play aunt's wishes should be respected. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't negate the author's right to the inheritance if the will is valid.\n"
