When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt over the years, doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. They didn't expect payment, but the play aunt left her estate to them. The play aunt's other relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping everything, and their husband says it's up to them. The question is whether the author is being an asshole by taking the inheritance as per the will.\n\nSo, the play aunt left the estate to the author, as per her will. The author was close to her, helped her out, and the relatives weren't around much. The key points here are intent and legal standing. The will is a legal document, so if it's valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but if the will is properly executed, their chances of success could be low. \n\nThe author's actions are in line with the deceased's wishes. The play aunt likely appreciated their support and chose to leave everything to them. The fact that the relatives aren't close and didn't participate in her care might support the author's position. However, if the relatives have grounds to contest (like the play aunt didn't have mental capacity, or the will was forged), that's different. But the author doesn't mention any such issues.\n\nMoral considerations: Did the author expect the inheritance? They didn't help for financial gain, so accepting it isn't greedy. The relatives, despite being blood, weren't present. The author's family was the ones who cared for her. So, morally, the author might not be in the wrong. Legally, if the will is valid, they aren't either.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The relatives might feel it's unfair, even if they weren't around. But the play aunt's choice is final unless there's a legal reason to challenge it. The author isn't obligated to give anything unless the will is invalidated. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they followed the deceased's wishes and the law.\n"
