When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received through their play aunt. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The play aunt isn't a blood relative, so that's important. The actual aunt is the executor of the estate, and the play aunt left her property and money to the author. The play aunt's other relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author feels annoyed that these relatives are involved now, especially since they weren't around much, and the author and their family helped out with tasks for years.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author received an inheritance via a will, the relatives are contesting it, and the author is considering keeping it. The question is whether this makes the author an asshole.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. If the relatives contest, but if the will is properly executed, they might not succeed. Ethically, the author helped the play aunt and the actual aunt, so maybe the play aunt intended to reward that help. The relatives weren't close, so their absence might be a factor.\n\nThe author's husband says it's up to them. The author is conflicted. The options are whether the author is wrong for keeping the inheritance. From a legal standpoint, unless the will is invalidated, they have a right. Ethically, if the will reflects the play aunt's wishes, then perhaps it's correct. The relatives being upset could be due to feeling ignored, but if the play aunt chose who she wanted, that's her right.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is following the deceased's wishes, and the relatives' potential contest might not change that unless the will is proven invalid. The author's actions align with the play aunt's expressed intentions, which is a strong ethical point.\n"
