When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who isn't a blood relative. The key points are that the author and their actual aunt did chores for the play aunt over the years, and now the play aunt left her estate to the author. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the will was properly executed and not contested successfully, the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. However, the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal. The user's husband says it's up to the author to decide, but the author is conflicted because the relatives haven't been involved.\n\nThe author mentions that the play aunt spent most holidays with them, and the relatives weren't close. The author also helped out with chores without expecting payment. The play aunt's will reflects her wishes, so morally, if the author respects her wishes, they might not be in the wrong. But there's a social obligation angle too. The relatives might feel entitled, but if they were absent, the author's claim could be stronger.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, family comes first regardless of closeness, but in others, fulfilling the deceased's final wishes is paramount. The author's actions align with the deceased's expressed wishes, which could support their decision. The annoyance at the relatives' involvement might be justified if they were neglectful. However, the author might be seen as disregarding potential family ties if they take everything without sharing.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is bound by the deceased's wishes versus family obligations. Since the will is clear and the relatives weren't involved, the author is likely not in the wrong. But if there's a valid contest, maybe there's a legal aspect, but the question is about moral wrong. The author's reasoning seems valid, so answer B.\n"
