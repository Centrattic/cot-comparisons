When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Total Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who wasn't related by blood. The author and their family helped the play aunt with tasks like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn for years, and now the play aunt left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the expectations of the relatives, the intentions of the play aunt, and the actions of the author. The play aunt didn't have children and the author's family was close to her, providing care and support. The author wasn't expecting compensation but received an inheritance. The relatives haven't been involved for years, and the author feels justified in keeping the inheritance because they were the ones who provided support. \n\nInheritance laws usually go by the will's terms unless there are legal challenges. Since the author is the named beneficiary, they might be within their rights. However, morally, if the relatives had a legal claim or if the play aunt's intentions were unclear, there could be an issue. But the author mentions the relatives haven't been around and the play aunt spent time with them. The husband says it's up to the author. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong, not legal per se. The author isn't obligated to share unless there's a moral duty. Since the play aunt chose them, and the relatives were distant, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author isn't being an asshole for following the will's instructions, especially considering their long-term support.\n"
