When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt left her property and money to them through her will, and the relatives are upset and might contest it. The user is considering keeping it because the relatives weren't close, and their family had helped out a lot over the years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will is valid and the user is a named beneficiary, they have a legal right to the inheritance. Unless the relatives can prove the will is invalid (like undue influence or lack of mental capacity), the user isn't legally in the wrong. But the question is about being morally or socially in the wrong, not legally.\n\nMorally, the user's family provided care and support for years. The play aunt was close to them, and the relatives weren't around. The user might feel they were considered family by the aunt, hence the bequest. However, the relatives might argue they have a right as blood relatives. But if the aunt chose to leave it to someone she considered family, even if not blood-related, that's her right. The user isn't obligated to give it up unless they feel a moral duty. \n\nThe husband says it's up to the user. The user's annoyance at the relatives now being involved is understandable given their lack of presence. So, in terms of morality, the user isn't in the wrong for following the aunt's wishes. The relatives might be in a legal fight, but the user isn't at fault for receiving what was given to them.\n"
