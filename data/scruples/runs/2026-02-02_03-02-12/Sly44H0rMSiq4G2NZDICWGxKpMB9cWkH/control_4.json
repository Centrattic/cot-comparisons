When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they were left by a \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship, the care provided, and the will's validity.\n\nFirst, the author and their actual aunt did chores for the play aunt over the years. They mention it wasn't much extra work and they didn't expect compensation. The play aunt's relatives are upset because they weren't given anything, even though they weren't close. The author's aunt, as executor, says to keep everything. \n\nThe play aunt left her assets to the author, so unless the will is contested successfully, the author is legally entitled to it. The relatives haven't spoken directly to the author and are just talking about contesting. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are involved now, given their lack of presence in the play aunt's life.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong. Morally, it might be a gray area. The author and their family provided care and were close, while the relatives were distant. The author's decision to keep the inheritance could be seen as respecting the play aunt's wishes, especially if she valued their support. The husband's advice to let the author decide supports that view. Since the relatives haven't made a formal claim yet, the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer is B.\n"
