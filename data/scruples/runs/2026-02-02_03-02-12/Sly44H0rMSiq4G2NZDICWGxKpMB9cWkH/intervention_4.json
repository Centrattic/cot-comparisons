When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author helped care for their play aunt over the years, doing small tasks like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. The play aunt wasn't a blood relative but was close to the author's actual aunt. The play aunt left her estate to the author through her actual aunt, the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author feels they've done their part and that the relatives weren't around much. The husband says it's up to the author, but they're wondering if they're being an asshole by keeping the inheritance.\n\nNow, considering the law: If the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, the author is legally entitled to the inheritance. The author's actions were based on prior arrangements where they provided care without expecting payment. The play aunt's relatives not being involved in her daily life might be a point in the author's favor.\n\nMoral perspective: The author helped the aunt for years, and she appreciated them enough to leave her estate. The relatives aren't close, so maybe it's fair that the author keeps it. The author is not obligated to share unless legally required. The annoyance from the relatives might stem from their own lack of involvement.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was there any expectation of compensation? The author didn't expect payment, but the inheritance is a separate matter. The relatives contesting the will could be a red flag if they have a valid legal claim. However, the author isn't in the wrong if the will is valid. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they contributed to the aunt's well-being, and the relatives were absent. The husband's advice supports the author's autonomy. \n\nSo, legally and morally, the author seems justified in keeping the inheritance. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
