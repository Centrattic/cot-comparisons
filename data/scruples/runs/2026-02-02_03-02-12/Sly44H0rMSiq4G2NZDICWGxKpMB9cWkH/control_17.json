When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about an inheritance. The author, along with their actual aunt, helped take care of their \"play aunt\" by doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They didn't expect anything in return. Now, the play aunt left her property and money to the author, and her relatives are upset, considering contesting the will.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal side. If the will is valid and the play aunt clearly stated that the author should inherit, then legally, the author has a right to that inheritance. The relatives might have a claim if they believe the will was made under undue influence, or if there were certain legal requirements not met, but the author isn't necessarily at fault here unless they did something legally wrong like forging the will or pressuring the play aunt.\n\nEthically, the author feels justified because they and their aunt helped care for the play aunt over the years. The relatives weren't around, so the author might feel they deserve the inheritance more. The husband says it's up to the author to decide, which suggests that the moral responsibility isn't clear-cut. The author is annoyed that the relatives are now upset after not being involved, which complicates things. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for accepting the inheritance. Since the will was made by the deceased and the author didn't influence it (assuming it's a valid will), they aren't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the author's fault. The author isn't obligated to give up what was left to them unless there's a legal ruling against it. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
