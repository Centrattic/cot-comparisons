When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The scenario is that the author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores over the years, and in return, the play aunt left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and considering contesting the will, but they haven't been involved in her life much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the will was properly executed and the author is a named beneficiary, then legally they have the right to the inheritance. The question is more about moral or social wrongness rather than legal. The author isn't a blood relative, but they were part of the play aunt's life, helping her out and being close. The relatives weren't around much, so maybe the play aunt had good reason to leave it to the author.\n\nThe key points here are the relationship's nature and the intentions behind the will. The author and their aunt did a lot for the play aunt, which the play aunt appreciated, as shown by her bequest. The relatives' potential contest might be based on their relationship, but if they were distant, it's less clear they should have a claim. The author feels justified in keeping it because of their involvement and the play aunt's expressed wishes through the will.\n\nThe husband's opinion is that it's up to the author, which adds to the idea that there's no obligation beyond what the will states. The author isn't doing anything illegal, and since the will reflects the play aunt's wishes, morally they might not be in the wrong. The relatives could contest, but that's a legal matter, not a moral judgment on the author.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
