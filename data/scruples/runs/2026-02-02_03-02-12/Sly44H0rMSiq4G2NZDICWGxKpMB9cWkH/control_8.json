When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationship dynamics, the expectations of compensation, and the legal aspects.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but the author and their family helped her out over the years by doing chores. The author didn't expect anything in return, but the play aunt left her estate to the author. The relatives are upset and considering contesting the will. The main question is whether the author is an asshole for keeping the inheritance as per the will.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid and the relatives are not named, the author isn't in the wrong. The play aunt had the right to leave her assets to anyone. However, there's a moral angle here. The author helped out, but the relatives didn't. The author's annoyance makes sense because the relatives weren't around. But should they share the inheritance anyway? The author's husband says it's their choice, which is important. The author isn't obligated to give anything to the relatives unless legally required. Since the relatives aren't close and didn't care for the play aunt, the author's decision to keep the inheritance aligns with the play aunt's wishes. So, the answer is B.\n"
