When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from a \"play aunt.\" \n\nFirst, the setup: The author and their actual aunt took care of the play aunt by doing chores like shoveling snow and cutting grass. They didn't expect payment because the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids. The play aunt's relatives aren't close, haven't visited much, and the author's actual aunt is the executor. The play aunt left her property and money to the author. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't contacted the author directly. The author is annoyed and plans to keep the inheritance, not give money or property to the relatives but maybe family photos.\n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, if the will is valid and the play aunt clearly intended to leave the inheritance to the author, then the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives contesting the will would need legal grounds, like the will being invalid, the aunt being under undue influence, etc. If the will is valid, the author is within their rights to keep the inheritance.\n\nMoral/ethical aspect: The author did help the play aunt for years, the play aunt was close to them, and the relatives weren't around. The author didn't expect payment, but the play aunt left them an inheritance. The author feels they're entitled to it because of their relationship and the effort they put in. The relatives aren't close, so maybe the play aunt didn't want them to inherit. The author's annoyance is understandable given the situation. The husband supports the author's decision to choose whether to give anything.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the relatives should have a share since they are family. But the play aunt might have felt the author and their actual aunt were more like family, especially since they provided care. Also, the author didn't seek the inheritance; it was the play aunt's choice. The relatives haven't reached out to the author, so maybe they're not serious about contesting. If the will is valid, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They acted according to the play aunt's wishes, provided care, and the relatives haven't made a valid legal argument. The author's decision is ethical and legal.\n"
