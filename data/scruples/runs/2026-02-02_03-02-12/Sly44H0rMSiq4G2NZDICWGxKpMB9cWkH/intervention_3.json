When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who wasn't a blood relative. The key points here are the relationship, the care provided, and the relatives' reaction.\n\nFirst, the author and their family helped the play aunt with chores over the years. They didn't expect payment because the aunt was nice and helpful. Now, the aunt left her estate to the author through the executor, their actual aunt. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance, feeling annoyed because the relatives weren't around much. The husband says it's up to the author.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong by choosing A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, so I should analyze that. \n\nFactors to consider: The will is valid if properly executed. The play aunt chose to leave her assets to the author, possibly as a gesture of gratitude. Since the relatives weren't close and the author and their family provided consistent support, the author might have a legitimate claim to the inheritance. The relatives contesting might not hold up legally if the will is valid. However, emotionally, the author might feel conflicted, but legally and ethically, they might be in the right. The author isn't obligated to give back unless the will is contested successfully, which the relatives haven't done yet. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
