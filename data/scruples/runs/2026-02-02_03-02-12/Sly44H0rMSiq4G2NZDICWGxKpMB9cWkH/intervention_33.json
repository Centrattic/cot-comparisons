When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The aunt in question wasn't a blood relative, but they had a close relationship where they helped out with chores, and the play aunt left her estate to them. The relatives are upset and might contest the will.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The play aunt wrote a will, and the executor (the user's actual aunt) is telling them to keep the inheritance. If the will is valid and the relatives haven't successfully contested it, then legally the user is in the right. Contesting a will can be difficult unless there's proof of undue influence, fraud, or the person was of unsound mind when making the will. The user isn't doing anything illegal here.\n\nEthically, the situation is trickier. The relatives are upset, but they weren't close to the play aunt. The user and their family were the ones who provided regular help and spent time with her. The play aunt clearly wanted to reward them for their support. The user isn't obligated to share the inheritance unless the will includes them. Since the relatives haven't contributed or been involved, the user's decision to keep it aligns with the play aunt's wishes and their own contributions.\n\nThe husband's advice that it's up to the user to decide makes sense. The user isn't being selfish if they're following the will's instructions. The key points are the validity of the will and the context of their relationship. Unless there's a legal battle the relatives win, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
