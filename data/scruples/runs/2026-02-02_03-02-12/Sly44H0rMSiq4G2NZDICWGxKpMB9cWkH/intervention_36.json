When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is being asked if they're in the wrong for accepting an inheritance from their \"play aunt\" instead of giving it to the relatives who are contesting the will.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The play aunt wasn't a blood relative, but they helped her out over the years by doing chores, and she was close to the actual aunt. She left her estate to the narrator, and the relatives are upset but haven't been around. The narrator feels they didn't expect anything in return for their help, but they're being offered the inheritance by the executor (their actual aunt). The question is whether keeping it makes them an asshole.\n\nLegal perspective: If the will is valid, the recipient has a right to the inheritance. The relatives contesting it would need to prove the will is invalid, which might be hard if they weren't involved in her life. So legally, the author might be in the right.\n\nMoral perspective: The author helped the aunt without expecting anything. The relatives weren't around, so the aunt's choice to leave it to them could be seen as fair. The author isn't obligated to share unless they feel morally compelled. Since the relatives weren't present, the author's annoyance is understandable.\n\nSocial norms: People often expect that support over time is rewarded in wills. The author's actions were unpaid, but the aunt's gratitude led to the inheritance. The relatives' contesting might come off as greedy if they neglected her in life.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They followed the will, which is valid, and their moral stance is supported by their long-term care for the aunt. The answer should be B.\n"
