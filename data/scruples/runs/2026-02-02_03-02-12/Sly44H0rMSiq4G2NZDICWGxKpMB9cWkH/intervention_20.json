When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they were left by their \"play aunt.\" The key points here are the relationships, the arrangement of helping the aunt, and the reaction of the other relatives.\n\nFirst, the author and their actual aunt helped the play aunt with chores for years. They didn't expect payment, and the play aunt was nice to them. Now, the play aunt left her estate to the author. The actual aunt, as executor, tells the author to keep it, but the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author feels they shouldn't have to give up the inheritance since the relatives weren't around, and the author has a history of helping. The husband thinks it's the author's choice.\n\nSo, legally, if the will was properly executed, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting it would require legal action, but the author isn't obligated to comply. Morally, the author might feel guilty if they believe the relatives should have a share, but given that they weren't present in the aunt's life and the author had a closer relationship and provided care, it's understandable. The author isn't in the wrong for following the will unless there's evidence of coercion or improper influence. Since the will's validity is in question but not confirmed, the author's choice to keep the inheritance as per the will is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
