When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not forgoing an inheritance. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the \"play aunt\" isn't a blood relative. The person and their actual aunt helped her with chores over the years, which wasn't much extra work because they were nearby. The play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helpful to their kids. The actual aunt is the executor and found out that the play aunt left her estate to the person. The relatives are upset and might contest the will. The person is annoyed because the relatives didn't stay close but now want a share. They're considering keeping the inheritance, and the husband says it's up to them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the play aunt made a will that includes the person, the relatives are unhappy but weren't close, the person felt no obligation since the relatives weren't involved. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by accepting the inheritance.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the person is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting would depend on their relationship and the will's validity. But morally, the person might feel conflicted. However, the play aunt had a relationship with them and the actual aunt, and the relatives were distant. The person's actions (helping out) were done without expectation of reward. The play aunt's decision to leave the inheritance is her choice. The author is following the deceased's wishes, so morally, they might not be in the wrong. The relatives not being close could justify not sharing. So the answer is B.\n"
