When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is referred to as \"Play Aunt,\" not a blood relative. She had a close relationship with the author's actual aunt and the author. They helped care for the Play Aunt, doing small chores. When the Play Aunt died, her actual relatives are upset because she left her property and money to the author instead of them. The author's aunt is the executor and says they should keep everything. The author is considering keeping the inheritance and is asking if they're an asshole for doing so.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nSo, key points: Play Aunt wasn't a blood relative. The author and their family provided care, though the author didn't expect payment. The relatives weren't around much; the Play Aunt spent time with the author's family. The author is following the will as written. The relatives haven't tried to contact the author directly, only the aunt.\n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the author is entitled to the inheritance. The relatives contesting the will would need to do so legally. The author's actions here are about following the deceased's wishes. Emotionally, the author might feel conflicted, but legally and based on the relationship, they might not be in the wrong. The author didn't promise anything; the Play Aunt chose to leave the inheritance to them. The author's husband says it's up to them, which supports their right to keep it.\n\nPossible arguments against: Maybe the author should have shared the inheritance because the relatives are family. But the Play Aunt didn't choose to leave it to them, and the author's family was actively involved in her care. The relatives weren't present, so the Play Aunt's choice might be justified.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
