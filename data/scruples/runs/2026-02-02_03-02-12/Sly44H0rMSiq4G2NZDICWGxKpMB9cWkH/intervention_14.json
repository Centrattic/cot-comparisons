When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance from their \"play aunt.\" Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's play aunt isn't a blood relative. The aunt and the author's actual aunt are close friends. The author and their family helped out with tasks like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn for both aunts. This was convenient since they lived nearby and it wasn't much extra work. The author didn't expect payment, but the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with college stuff. \n\nNow, the play aunt died, and her actual relatives are upset that the author inherited her property and money. The executor, the actual aunt, told the author to keep everything. The author feels annoyed that the relatives are involved, given that they weren't around much. The author's husband says it's up to them, but the author is unsure if they're being an asshole by keeping the inheritance.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author had a long-standing relationship with the play aunt, provided help without expecting payment, and the relatives weren't involved in her life. The will was made according to the aunt's wishes, and the executor supports the author keeping the inheritance. The relatives are considering contesting the will, but they haven't approached the author directly.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the will is valid and the executor has confirmed the author is the rightful heir, the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives might have grounds to contest the will if they can prove undue influence or lack of capacity, but the author's actions don't seem to indicate that. Ethically, the author's decision is based on their relationship with the play aunt and the support they provided. Since the relatives weren't close and the author's contributions were consistent over the years, it's reasonable for the author to accept the inheritance as per the will. The author isn't obligated to share it unless legally compelled, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
