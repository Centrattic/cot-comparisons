When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt,\" who's not a blood relative. The author and their family helped the aunt with chores for years, and now the aunt left her estate to the author through their real aunt, who is the executor. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't been around much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will was properly executed and the relatives aren't mentioned as heirs, the author is entitled to the inheritance unless there's a legal challenge. The relatives talking about contesting it might not have grounds if they weren't legally obligated. But since the author is being asked if they're in the wrong morally, not legally, the answer would focus on that.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the relatives weren't around, and the aunt spent most time with them. They helped out without expecting anything. The husband says it's up to the author to decide. The question is whether keeping the inheritance makes the author an asshole.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's actions were based on a long-term relationship and the aunt's expressed wishes. The relatives weren't involved, so following the aunt's wishes might be justified. However, giving some gesture to the relatives could be seen as kind, but the author isn't obligated. The key point is that the author didn't act with malice and the will is clear. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
