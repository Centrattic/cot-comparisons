When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for not giving up an inheritance they received. The key points here are about the relationship dynamics, the work done for the \"play aunt,\" and the legal aspects.\n\nFirst, the person helped take care of the play aunt for years, which included chores and other favors. The play aunt wasn't a blood relation, but they were close enough that the actual aunt (the executor) was involved. The play aunt left her estate to them, but her relatives are upset and might contest the will. \n\nLegally, if the will is valid, the person is entitled to the inheritance. The play aunt had the right to choose her heirs, even if they aren't blood relatives. The author's husband supports their decision, which shows some family backing. The relatives haven't talked directly to the author, which might affect their ability to contest the will. \n\nEthically, the author feels justified because they provided care and support, unlike the relatives. The question is whether they're being selfish by keeping the inheritance. However, the play aunt's wishes should be respected unless the will is invalid. Since the relatives haven't provided proof of contesting the will, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might feel morally conflicted, but legally and based on the facts given, they're not wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
