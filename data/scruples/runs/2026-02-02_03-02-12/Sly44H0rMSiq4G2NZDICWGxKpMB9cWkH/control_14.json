When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's \"play aunt\" (not a blood relative) left her inheritance to them, and now the aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance because they've had a long-term relationship with the play aunt, helping her with tasks for years, and the play aunt was nice to them and their kids. The author's actual aunt, who is the executor, thinks they should keep it, but the relatives are unhappy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the will is valid and the play aunt legally named the author as a beneficiary, then from a legal standpoint, the author has a right to the inheritance. The relatives might contest it, but if the will is valid, they probably can't do much. So legally, the author is okay.\n\nMoral-wise, the author has a long history of helping the play aunt, who treated them well. The relatives weren't around much and didn't contribute to her care. The author might feel that they deserve the inheritance because they were the ones supporting the aunt. However, some might argue that the author shouldn't benefit monetarily just because they helped out, especially if they weren't promised compensation. But the play aunt did leave the inheritance, which is her choice.\n\nThe question is whether the author is \"in the wrong\" by accepting it. If the author isn't doing anything illegal and the will is valid, then they aren't wrong. The relatives' potential contest is their issue, not the author's. The author's intention is to follow the play aunt's wishes, which is respectful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're respecting the will and have a valid relationship with the deceased. The relatives' dissatisfaction doesn't make the author at fault.\n"
