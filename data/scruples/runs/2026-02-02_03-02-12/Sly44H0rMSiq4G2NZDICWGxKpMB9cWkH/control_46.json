When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not giving up an inheritance they received from their \"play aunt.\" The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author and their family helped the play aunt with chores for years. They didn't expect payment, but the play aunt left her property and money to them. The actual aunt is the executor and told the author to keep it. But the play aunt's relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is annoyed they're involved now since they weren't close to the aunt. The husband says it's up to the author.\n\nSo, the key points here: The will was made by the deceased, and the author is following her wishes. The relatives aren't close, and the author's family had a long-term relationship with the aunt. Legally, if the will is valid, the author has the right to the inheritance. Morally, it's about whether the author is being fair. The author isn't giving anything to the relatives, but they weren't part of her life. The author's actions align with what the deceased wanted, so legally they're right. The question is if they're in the wrong morally. Since the author didn't do anything wrong legally and the relatives weren't involved, the answer is B. They aren't in the wrong.\n"
