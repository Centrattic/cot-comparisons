When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up the inheritance they received from the \"play aunt.\" Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the play aunt wasn't a blood relative. The author and their actual aunt took care of her by doing chores like shoveling snow and mowing the lawn. They mention it wasn't a lot of extra work, which is important. The play aunt had other relatives, but they weren't close and didn't visit much. The author didn't expect any payment for the help they provided, especially since the play aunt was nice to them as a kid and helped their kids with things like college letters. \n\nNow, the play aunt's estate left everything to the author through the executor, the actual aunt. The relatives are upset and might contest the will, but they haven't approached the author directly. The author feels annoyed that these distant relatives are involved now, especially since they weren't around when the play aunt needed help. The husband says it's up to the author to decide whether to give them anything.\n\nThe key points here seem to be about the intent and actions of the author. The author didn't expect compensation, and the play aunt made a will in their favor. The relatives are upset because they weren't included, but they had a history of not being close. The author is following the play aunt's wishes as per the will. \n\nI need to consider if the author is obligated to share the inheritance with the relatives. Inheritance laws can vary, but generally, if someone leaves their estate to someone specific in their will, others can't claim it unless they have legal grounds (like being a forced heir under certain jurisdictions). The author isn't legally bound unless the relatives contest the will successfully. Since the author is following the will as made by the deceased, it's their right to keep the inheritance. The annoyance the author feels from the relatives' complaints seems justified given their lack of involvement in the play aunt's life. The author's actions are respectful of the deceased's wishes and their own long-term relationship with her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for keeping the inheritance.\n"
