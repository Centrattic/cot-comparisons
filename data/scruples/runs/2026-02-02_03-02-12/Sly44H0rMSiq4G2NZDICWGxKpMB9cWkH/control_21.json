When she was still alive she lived near my actual aunt and they were good friends. Neither of them ever had kids, so when we would do something for my actual aunt (shovel snow, cut the grass, etc) we would also do it for my play aunt. It wasn't a lot of extra work on our part since we were literally up the street and it was usually an extra 20 or 30 minutes of work. It's an arrangement that worked for years and I genuinely didn't expect any compensation for it since she was always nice to me as a kid and super helpful to my kids (college letters and so on) and to my actual aunt.  Play Aunt has some relatives but they didn't visit much and weren't AFAIK close to her. Anyway my actual aunt is the executor of her estate and she pulled me aside after the services and such were over to let me know that play aunt left her property and money to me. It's not a lot, she wasn't wealthy but she owned her home, had a car, and life insurance. My aunt thinks I should just keep everything, but I know that Play Aunt's relatives are not happy about it. They talked about contesting her will, but I don't know how serious they are about it since they had that conversation with my aunt and not with me. I find myself super annoyed that now they're involved but they haven't been around for years to the point that she spent most of her holidays with us. I'd give them any family pictures and such, but not the money or the real property. My husband says it is up to me to decide if I want to give them anything, so would I be an asshole to just obey her wishes? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an inheritance from a \"play aunt\" who isn't a blood relative. The author helped care for the aunt along with their actual aunt by doing chores. The play aunt left her estate to them, including her home and car, but her relatives are upset and might contest the will. The author is considering keeping the inheritance despite the relatives' potential objections.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the will is valid and properly executed, then the author is entitled to the inheritance. The fact that the relatives haven't been involved much but are now upset could be a red flag. However, if the will is legally sound, the author isn't breaking any laws by accepting it. But maybe there's a moral aspect here.\n\nThe author helped care for the aunt, which might influence their expectation of being left something. The aunt in question wasn't their blood relative, but they had a close relationship. The actual aunt is the executor and supports the author keeping the inheritance. The key points here are the validity of the will, the intentions of the deceased, and the moral obligation towards distant relatives.\n\nMorally, if the deceased clearly intended for the author to receive the inheritance and there's no evidence of coercion or undue influence in the will's creation, then the author isn't in the wrong. The relatives' potential contest might not hold up if the will is properly documented. However, if there's a valid reason to believe the will was made under duress or without the deceased's clear mind, that's different. But the scenario doesn't mention any such issues.\n\nThe author feels justified because they cared for the aunt and the deceased was nice to them. The relatives weren't around, so maybe the deceased had a right to decide who to leave her belongings to. The husband's advice that it's up to the author to decide aligns with this. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they follow the deceased's wishes as expressed in the will. Unless there's a legal reason to doubt the will, the answer would be B.\n"
