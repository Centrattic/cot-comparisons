Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author, let's call them Will, and his fianc\u00e9e Jill had a history of being late. The wedding was at 4:30, so they needed to leave by 3:45. Will warned Jill to start getting ready earlier. When the time came, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were only slightly dry, and he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, Will was concerned about being punctual and respectful to others, which is understandable. He had given warnings, and he tried to be proactive. But he raised his voice, which is a sign of yelling and could be hurtful. Then, he left without her, which might be seen as abandonment or not supporting her in that moment. On the other hand, Jill admitted she's not good at time management and didn't meet the deadline. She might be defensive because she's aware she was late, but being angry at Will for his reaction complicates things.\n\nThe main points here are accountability. Will took action because he didn't want to be late, which is valid, but his approach may have been harsh. Yelling and leaving could be seen as overreacting, even if Jill is at fault. The question is whether Will's response was justified. Also, leaving someone at home before a public event might have added to Jill's stress and could be seen as not being supportive. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe a better approach would be to stay and help, or find a solution together. But the author's reasoning is that he couldn't wait any longer and didn't want to be late. So, is he in the wrong for leaving? It might depend on cultural or personal expectations. Some might say he should have been more patient, while others might support his stance on punctuality. \n\nHowever, the act of leaving her alone when she's unprepared could be seen as selfish or not considering her feelings. Even if she's responsible for her time, his response might have been too harsh. The author is aware he raised his voice, which is a wrongdoing. So maybe he's partially at fault. The answer might be that he is in the wrong because his actions, while stemming from frustration, were not supportive and could have been handled better. So the answer would be A.\n"
