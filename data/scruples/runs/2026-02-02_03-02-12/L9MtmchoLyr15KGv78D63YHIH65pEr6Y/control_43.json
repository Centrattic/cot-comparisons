Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who left their fianc\u00e9e at home (called Jill) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context: They were going to a wedding starting at 4:30 PM. The fianc\u00e9e had been warned to leave by 3:45 PM, but she wasn't ready by 4:00 PM. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and then left her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nSo, the main points are:\n1. The author tried to set a strict time (3:45 PM) to leave to avoid being late.\n2. Jill wasn't ready by the deadline, leading the author to leave without her.\n3. The author raised their voice in frustration.\n4. The author left her alone and went to the wedding.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's side is that they were trying to be on time, which they consider respectful. They had warned Jill before. Jill's side is that she was left alone, and the author was mean by yelling and not helping her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, leaving a partner at home before an event they're attending together could be seen as abandonment. Even if Jill was responsible for her own time management, the author could have handled the situation differently. Yelling might have escalated things unnecessarily. However, the author's intention was to avoid being late, which is understandable.\n\nBut by leaving without her, the author prioritized punctuality over her feelings. That might be where the mistake is. Also, communication could have been better. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe they could have discussed solutions together, like staying home if they were going to be late, or calling someone to let them know.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as harsh, even if the intention was good. The key is whether the method used was appropriate. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the way they handled the situation, despite the initial problem being Jill's time management.\n"
