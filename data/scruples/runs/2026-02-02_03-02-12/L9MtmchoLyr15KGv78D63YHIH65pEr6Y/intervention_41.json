Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, looking at the timeline. The wedding starts at 4:30, and the author (let's call him Will) told Jill to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine. Then at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, saying he'd meet her there.\n\nSo, the key points here. Will had given clear instructions about the time they needed to leave. Jill had been warned multiple times about her time management issues. She agreed she would be ready on time. But when the time came, she wasn't. Will tried to wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the latest departure time. He got upset, raised his voice, then left.\n\nNow, the fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would dry, and yelled. But from Will's perspective, he's trying to respect the commitment to be on time and is frustrated because this is a recurring issue.\n\nIs Will in the wrong? Well, everyone has different time management styles. Jill might feel disrespected, but Will has a valid point about being on time for others. However, raising his voice could be seen as harsh. But considering the context, maybe his frustration is understandable. He had warned her, and she didn't take it seriously. Leaving might be a last resort to not miss the event.\n\nBut leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her, even if she's responsible for her own actions. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he followed through on his plan to leave when she wasn't ready, maybe he's justified. The yelling is a negative point, but the main issue is about the decision to leave. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe a better approach would have been to talk it out beforehand, but given the situation, leaving might be his way of holding her accountable. So I think he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
