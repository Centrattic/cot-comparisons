Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they left their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management, and they often end up late. The author warned her they needed to leave by 3:45, but she wasn't ready until 4:00, so he left her and went to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author seems to be trying to manage their time and avoid being late, which they see as rude. They also mention that this is a recurring issue, so maybe they're frustrated. They did raise their voice, which is a problem, but they left to meet her later. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled.\n\nNow, the key points here are responsibility and communication. The author gave a clear deadline and tried to set expectations. However, they might have escalated the situation by yelling. Leaving her might have been a way to prioritize the event, but it could also be seen as abandoning her. On the other hand, Jill didn't meet the deadline, which might be her fault for not managing her time. But was leaving the only option? Maybe they could have left earlier, but the author was strict on the time. Also, the author did go to the wedding, so it wasn't like they bailed entirely. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author's frustration is understandable, but the yelling and leaving might not be the best approach. However, given that it's a recurring problem, maybe the author is right to enforce the time. But in the moment, maybe there's a better way to handle it without yelling or leaving. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they tried to communicate the deadline and took action when it wasn't met. But maybe there's a middle ground. Hmm.\n"
