Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had a conversation earlier where the author set a 3:45 PM deadline to leave by, but she wasn't ready by then. The author waited until 4:00, then left, and now Jill is upset.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to be late, which they consider rude. They also mentioned that this kind of time issue happens often between them. The key points here are communication, expectations, and how they handled the situation.\n\nThe author did give a clear deadline (3:45) and reminded her to start early enough. Jill said she'd be fine, but she didn't manage her time properly. The author waited an extra 15 minutes, which is more than the buffer they had (since the wedding starts at 4:30, leaving at 3:45 gives a 15-minute buffer, but the author waited until 4:00, so maybe 10 minutes buffer left). However, the author raised their voice in frustration. That's a point against them, as yelling can be seen as harsh, even if it's from stress.\n\nThe author left without her, which might be considered abandonment, but considering the event is important and being late is a priority for them. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels it's her fault but is defensive. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Was the author too impatient? Did they handle the situation poorly by yelling? Should they have given more time or found another solution? On the flip side, Jill isn't managing her time as discussed, and the author made a choice to avoid being late.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because they set a clear expectation and gave a deadline. However, raising their voice is a misstep. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since the author tried to communicate and waited a bit longer than strictly necessary, but left to avoid being late, it's a bit of a split. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So likely answer B.\n"
