Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author (let's call him Will) and his fianc\u00e9e Jill were going to a wedding that starts at 4:30 PM. The wedding is 30 minutes away, so they need to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. Will told Jill to start getting ready two hours before to ensure the laundry would be done. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45 PM, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling her he'd meet her there. Now Jill is upset, saying he was impatient, told her clothes would dry, and was mean for yelling.\n\nSo, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLet me break this down. \n\nFirst, communication. Will gave Jill a clear deadline (3:45 PM) and told her to start getting ready at 1:30 PM. Jill said she'd be fine, but didn't manage her time. Will's frustration is understandable, but raising his voice is a problem. \n\nThen, the action of leaving her. Leaving her at home when she wasn't ready\u2014was that wrong? Well, maybe. If the event is important, being on time is a priority. But leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her, especially if she wasn't ready due to her own time management. \n\nBut also, Will told her the clothes \"would be dry\" when he said \"probably up to you.\" He might have implied they would dry, but if they didn't, that's on Jill's judgment. \n\nSo, Will's accountability: He raised his voice, which is a sign of yelling, which isn't great. Also, leaving her might have been a harsh reaction. However, he did give her multiple chances to get ready. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's time management is an issue. She's aware of this, as they have this conversation often. She might be at fault for not managing her time, but that doesn't fully absolve Will of his actions. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often expect a balance. If one person is in the wrong, but the other's reaction is also problematic. Here, both have some issues. However, the question is specifically about whether Will is in the wrong. \n\nLeaving her: If you intentionally leave someone behind, even if they're responsible for the situation, it's a bit harsh. Especially in a relationship, maybe he should have waited a bit longer, or handled it differently. \n\nBut maybe he had good reason to prioritize being on time. However, leaving her and not waiting could be seen as not supporting her, especially if she's in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready). \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he raised his voice and left her, even though her time management is an issue. But others might think he's not in the wrong because she was the one who caused the problem. \n\nI think in AITA, the community often looks at the action and the intent. Yelling and leaving could be seen as his fault, even if she's partly at fault. So the answer is A.\n"
