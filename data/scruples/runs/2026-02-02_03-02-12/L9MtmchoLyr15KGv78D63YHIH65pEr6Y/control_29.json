Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, there's the context they provided. They mention that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up late. The author is concerned about showing up on time and considers it rude. The wedding starts at 4:30, and he told her they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hits, she's not ready, and her clothes are only slightly dry. The author gets upset, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00, saying he'll meet her there. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling. That could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a stressful situation. Leaving without Jill might be impatience, but he was trying to be on time. However, by leaving her alone, he didn't consider her feelings or the possibility that she might need more time. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have known her own habits and still promised she'd be ready. The author had given her a clear deadline and warning. But even if she was at fault for not being ready, the way the author handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been harsh. \n\nAlso, the author is in a committed relationship, so communication and support are important. Leaving her alone in that situation could be seen as not being considerate of her needs, even if she was late. Maybe a better approach would have been to compromise, like leaving earlier or finding a way to help her get ready faster. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The user's perspective is that Jill is being defensive and in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is at fault. The act of leaving her could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was late. However, the author's intention was to be punctual and not make a scene at the wedding. \n\nI think there's some responsibility on both sides. The author could have handled the situation better without yelling and maybe found another solution instead of leaving her. But Jill also didn't manage her time well despite being warned. However, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he left her at home, which could be seen as a selfish act, and raised his voice, which is disrespectful, that's probably where he's in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
