Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding started at 4:30, and the author had told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 latest. Jill didn't get ready on time, so the author decided to leave without her.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author was concerned about being late, which they consider rude. They gave warnings earlier, like at 1:30 when they mentioned the laundry and the departure time. Jill said she'd be fine, but then wasn't ready by 3:45. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset, thinking the author was impatient and mean.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to plan ahead, set a clear deadline, and gave Jill a heads-up. They might feel justified in leaving to avoid being late. Also, they had a history of this time management issue, so maybe the author was trying to avoid a recurring problem. However, raising their voice could be seen as yelling, which is unkind regardless of the situation. Leaving Jill alone when she wasn't ready might have caused her distress, especially since they're engaged and such events are important.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have misjudged her time again. She might not have realized the importance of the deadline. But the author's reaction of yelling and leaving could be seen as harsh. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's method of handling it might have been too severe. Maybe the author should have tried to find a middle ground, like staying a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of just leaving.\n\nAlso, considering their relationship, communication is key. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way they expressed it might have crossed a line. Yelling can be hurtful, and leaving without Jill could make her feel abandoned, even if the author thought it was the best option to be timely.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault for leaving, but the yelling and abrupt departure might make them share some responsibility. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding punctuality versus considering the other person's feelings. If the author's goal was to be polite and not disrupt the wedding, then leaving might be a consequence they accept. However, in a relationship, supporting each other through such situations is also important. So, there's a balance between being responsible and being considerate. \n\nIn conclusion, while Jill's time management is an issue, the author's approach might have been too harsh. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for the way they handled it, even if the intention was to avoid lateness. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving without considering Jill's feelings beyond just the time issue.\n"
