Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that they often have this problem where Jill isn't good with time management. He warned her they needed to leave by 3:45, which was two hours after their conversation. She assured him she'd be ready. When she wasn't, he got stressed and left her at home. \n\nHe raised his voice, which is a factor. Yelling is generally considered disrespectful, even in stressful situations. However, the context is important. The event was a wedding, which is a significant event where punctuality is important. The author felt she was responsible for her part (getting ready) and he was responsible for their timely arrival. \n\nJill's perspective is that he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean. He claims she knows she's in the wrong. But maybe there's more to it. Did he account for possible delays? He said the clothes might be dry, but she might have relied on that. If the dryer didn't finish, maybe he should have checked again closer to time. Also, leaving her at home could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes slightly wet). \n\nCommunication is key here. He gave a heads up, but maybe he should have followed up more. Did he give her enough time? She might have thought she had more time. The fact that he left before the event started but after waiting until 4:00 could be a point. Was he too strict on the timing? \n\nConsidering the emotional impact: Yelling and leaving her might have hurt her feelings. Even if he's frustrated, handling stress with yelling isn't good. However, his intention was to be on time, which is reasonable. \n\nIs he entirely in the wrong? Maybe not. But he did raise his voice and left her, which could be problematic. Jill also has a responsibility to manage her time better. However, in a relationship, supporting each other through these issues is important. He might not be in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he handled the situation. \n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there are elements where both could have handled it better. But based on the question, the options are A or B. Given the scenario, the author's actions were a reaction to Jill's repeated tardiness. Since he made a plan, warned her, and tried to be punctual, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the yelling and leaving could be issues. The community might split, but the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer leans toward B.\n"
