Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. Jill didn't get ready in time, and the author left her at 4:00 PM. He raised his voice in frustration, which Jill is upset about. She's angry because he was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry (which they weren't), and was mean by yelling. The author believes Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, considering the context: The author had given a clear deadline (3:45 PM). Jill indicated she would be okay, but didn't manage her time well. The author waited until 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes after the deadline, before leaving. He did raise his voice, which is a point of contention. \n\nNow, evaluating whether the author is in the wrong. Key points to consider: \n\n1. **Communication and Prior Warnings**: The author had previously mentioned the time constraints and the importance of punctuality. Jill didn't take those warnings seriously, leading to the situation. \n\n2. **Raising Voice**: The author did get upset and raised his voice, which can be seen as disrespectful. However, the user might argue that the frustration was justified given Jill's repeated lateness.\n\n3. **Decision to Leave**: The author left to avoid being late. Weddings are significant events where punctuality is expected. However, leaving a partner behind could be seen as harsh, but it's also a matter of respecting commitments to others versus respecting the relationship.\n\n4. **Jill's Responsibility**: Jill is responsible for her own preparation time. The author gave her the heads up, so he's not entirely at fault for her misjudgment.\n\n5. **Impact on Relationship**: The author's actions might have been necessary to maintain his integrity (not being late), but the method (raising voice) could have been handled better.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions stem from a desire to be punctual and avoid disrespecting others. However, the yelling and the decision to leave might have been harsh. But given that Jill was aware of the deadline and didn't meet it, the author's responsibility is mitigated. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by leaving her. Since they are engaged, this could have long-term relationship implications. However, the author's primary fault might be the raised voice, not necessarily leaving. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions have elements that could be criticized (yelling), the main issue is Jill's failure to meet her commitments. The author's decision to leave, though harsh, might be seen as an overcorrection due to frustration rather than being in the wrong.\n"
