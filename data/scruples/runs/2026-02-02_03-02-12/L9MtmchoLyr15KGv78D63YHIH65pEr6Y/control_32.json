Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had a prior discussion about leaving by 3:45 to get to the wedding on time. Jill assured her she'd be ready, but ended up not being ready by 4:00. The author left her at 4:00, got upset, raised their voice, and then left. Now Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't make sure the clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the key points. The author tried to set a time and gave a heads-up. Jill said she'd be fine. The author waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the agreed 3:45. He got frustrated and left. He raised his voice, which Jill found mean. \n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be responsible and not be late, which is understandable. On the other hand, raising your voice and leaving might be considered harsh, even if the fianc\u00e9e was at fault. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong for escalating the situation with yelling. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready, the author's reaction could be seen as disrespectful. Also, leaving her at home alone might not be the best approach, especially if she's not dressed yet. Maybe a better approach would be to wait a bit longer or help her get ready instead of leaving. \n\nHowever, Jill did know the time she had to get ready and didn't manage it properly. The author had a valid reason to be on time. But the method of handling it\u2014leaving and yelling\u2014could be the issue. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because while Jill's time management is a problem, the author's response was inappropriate. Both sides have issues, but the author's actions crossed into being mean and impulsive, which Jill is pointing out. The author's frustration is valid, but how they handled it is questionable.\n"
