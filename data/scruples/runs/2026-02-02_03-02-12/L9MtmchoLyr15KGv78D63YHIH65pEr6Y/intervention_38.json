Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, are going to a wedding that starts at 4:30 PM, which is about 30 minutes from their house. The author mentioned to Jill that they need to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to be on time. Jill said she would be fine, but when 3:45 PM comes around, she's still not ready\u2014naked, with damp clothes. The author gets frustrated, raises their voice, and leaves her at home to go to the wedding alone. Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling. The author feels Jill is being defensive and knows she's at fault.\n\nHmm. The main points here are about responsibility, communication, and expectations. The author planned ahead, gave a clear deadline, and warned Jill about the timing. Jill, on the other hand, didn't take the warning seriously, leading to the situation. But the author raised their voice, which is a problem. Even if the author had a valid reason for being frustrated, yelling is not a constructive way to handle it. Also, leaving Jill alone when she wasn't ready might have been a harsh reaction, even if she was at fault for not being prepared. The author could have tried to help her get ready or found another solution instead of leaving. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was to be respectful to the wedding guests by not being late. But there might be a balance between being considerate to others and being considerate to their partner. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting to be on time, but the way they handled the situation\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could have been worse. Jill's responsibility wasn't to make the author wait beyond a reasonable time, but the author also shouldn't have reacted so harshly. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled the situation better. The key issue is the yelling and leaving without ensuring Jill's safety or helping her. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to consider if their actions were justified. The author did warn her, gave a timeline, and when she didn't comply, they had to make a choice. However, the method of leaving and yelling might make the author partially at fault. But maybe the main fault is on Jill for not being ready on time. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being supportive enough. Relationships require understanding, so even if Jill was late, the author could have been more patient or adjusted. But the author mentions that this is a recurring issue, so maybe they were within their right to set a boundary. However, the yelling and leaving might be the part where they went overboard. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions (yelling and leaving) were justified. If the author felt that they couldn't wait any longer, maybe they had to leave, but the yelling is the main issue. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving. The act of leaving might not be the main issue if Jill was responsible for her own punctuality. But the yelling is a problem. The user's question is about leaving Jill at home. If the question is solely about leaving, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to be on time. However, the way they handled it (yelling) is the issue. But the user's focus is on the act of leaving. \n\nIn some cases, people might think that the author is in the wrong because it's harsh to leave a partner, but others might say that the author was within their rights if they set a clear deadline and the partner ignored it. So, maybe the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but the method of handling it could be better. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for leaving, not about the yelling. So, if the author gave a clear warning and Jill didn't meet it, the author might not be in the wrong for leaving. But perhaps the author should have considered other options, like waiting a bit longer or helping Jill get ready instead of leaving. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. The author set a time, Jill didn't meet it, and the author had to choose between being late or leaving Jill. The author might not be in the wrong for that choice, but the yelling is a separate issue. However, the question is about leaving. So, maybe B is the answer.\n"
