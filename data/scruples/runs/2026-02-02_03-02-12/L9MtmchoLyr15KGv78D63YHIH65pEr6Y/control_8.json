Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 latest to be on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, her clothes were still slightly damp, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM, telling her he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, made a promise about the laundry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo the key points here are: communication, time management, and the actions taken. Let's break it down. The author and Jill have had this issue before\u2014Jill isn't good at budgeting time, which leads to them being late. The author is concerned about being on time and sees punctuality as a matter of respect. Jill, on the other hand, might feel that her needs (like drying clothes properly) are being dismissed.\n\nThe author warned Jill in advance that they needed to leave at 3:45 and she agreed. However, when the time came, she wasn't ready. The author's frustration led him to raise his voice, which could be seen as yelling or being harsh. Then, instead of waiting further, he left, which is the main issue here.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he did communicate the time they needed to leave, gave her a heads-up, and tried to be helpful with the laundry. But he also raised his voice in frustration, which might have been unnecessary. However, the bigger issue is leaving her. By leaving, he didn't support her in getting ready, even if she was late. That could be seen as abandoning her, especially since they were going to a shared event. \n\nJill's perspective is important here too. If she's responsible for her own time management, but the author left her unprepared, that could be problematic. Also, the author's comment about her being defensive because she knows she's in the wrong might not be fair. It's possible that both parties have some responsibility here. The author could have handled the situation better, maybe by staying and helping her get ready instead of leaving. Meanwhile, Jill could have been more realistic about her time. \n\nBut the core question is whether the author is in the wrong. Leaving someone at home when they're not ready for an event they both wanted to attend might be considered inconsiderate, even if the intention was to be punctual. The act of leaving could be seen as selfish, especially if it's a one-time thing. However, if this is a recurring issue and the author has tried to address it multiple times, there might be some justification. Still, the final action of leaving might be the wrong move because it doesn't support Jill and could cause her embarrassment or stress. \n\nAlso, the author's argument that Jill is being defensive might not hold up. People often feel defensive when they're in a conflict, so that doesn't necessarily mean she's in the wrong. The author's behavior (yelling and leaving) could also be contributing factors. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community often looks at intent, actions, and whether someone's wrongdoings were justified. The author's actions, while perhaps coming from a place of wanting to be on time, might cross a line by abandoning Jill. So the answer could be that the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to make sure. \n\nWait, but the author did give her a clear deadline, warned her, and she didn't meet it. If the author left, maybe he's trying to hold her accountable. However, leaving her might be the problem. Maybe a better approach would have been to stay and help her get ready, even if it meant being late. That way, he's being supportive rather than abandoning her. \n\nSo the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because while he had a valid concern about being on time, leaving his fianc\u00e9e unprepared and not helping her get ready could be seen as inconsiderate and selfish. The yelling adds to the issue, and the act of leaving without ensuring she gets there is problematic.\n"
