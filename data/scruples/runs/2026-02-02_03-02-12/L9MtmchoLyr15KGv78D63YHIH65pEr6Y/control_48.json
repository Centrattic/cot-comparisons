Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, were going to a wedding that started at 4:30 PM. The author warned Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM. But at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were still slightly damp, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her at home. Now Jill is upset, thinking the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry time, and was mean. The author thinks Jill is deflecting because she knows she's wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted to be on time and had given a clear deadline. They mentioned they get stressed when they're late, which is reasonable. But they raised their voice, which can be seen as yelling or being mean. That's a point against the author. Also, leaving Jill alone when she wasn't ready might have been a harsh reaction. Even if Jill was late, abandoning her at home could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since they were going together. \n\nJill's side: She might not be great at time management, as the author mentioned. She might have thought she had enough time, but the author had already warned her about the 3:45 PM cutoff. However, if the laundry wasn't dry, maybe the author should have anticipated that the machine might not be done by then. The author told her the clothes would be dry \"probably,\" but maybe that's where the assumption went wrong. \n\nSo, the author's frustration is understandable, but yelling and leaving might be overreacting. The key points are: giving a clear deadline, but not accounting for possible delays in laundry. The author might have failed to check if the laundry was actually done, assuming it would be dry. Also, taking away Jill's agency by leaving her there could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to communicate the deadline and was frustrated because this happens often. But the solution of leaving her might not be the right approach. Maybe a better way would have been to wait a bit longer, even if it meant arriving slightly late, or helping her get ready. \n\nIn conclusion, while Jill's time management is an issue, the author's reaction (yelling and leaving) is problematic. They might be partially at fault for not being more understanding and for not finding a better solution. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because both sides have valid points.\n"
