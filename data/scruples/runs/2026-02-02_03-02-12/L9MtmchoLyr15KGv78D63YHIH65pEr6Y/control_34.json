Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author told Jill they had to leave by 3:45 at the latest. They discussed the laundry earlier, and Jill said she could manage. At 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, clothes were slightly damp, and the author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't account for the dry time, and yelled.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author set a clear time to leave. Jill didn't meet that deadline. The author got frustrated and left. But there's some elements to consider. The author did try to set expectations in advance, mentioning the 3:45 deadline. However, when things didn't go as planned, the response was to raise their voice and leave. \n\nLeaving the fianc\u00e9e alone, especially at home, when the event is about to start might be seen as abandoning her. Even if she was late, taking responsibility for getting there might be part of being in a relationship. Also, the author mentioned that they usually have this issue, which suggests a pattern. The author's frustration is understandable, but yelling and leaving without ensuring she gets there could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author was trying to be punctual and considerate of others' time. If they arrived late, it could disrupt the wedding. But leaving Jill alone might cause her stress or embarrassment, especially if she ends up arriving late alone. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The author did set a deadline, but maybe they should have planned more contingencies. However, the immediate reaction of yelling and leaving might be the main issue. The author is in a position to help Jill get ready, but instead left her, which could be seen as selfish or not supporting her. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that Jill's clothes were slightly damp. Maybe the author should have checked if the laundry would dry in time earlier, rather than relying on her to manage it. But that's a different point. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author did raise their voice, which is a negative action. Leaving without ensuring Jill gets to the event could be seen as putting their own preferences (punctuality) over her needs. So, maybe the author is at fault for the yelling and leaving her alone, even if Jill was late. \n\nBalancing both sides, the author might have a point about the punctuality, but the way they handled the situation could be seen as wrong. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
