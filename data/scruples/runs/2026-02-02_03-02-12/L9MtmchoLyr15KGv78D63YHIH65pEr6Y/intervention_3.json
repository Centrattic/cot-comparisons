Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't great with time management. The couple had a conversation earlier in the day about leaving by 3:45 PM for a 4:30 PM wedding. The author told her they needed to leave by 3:45, but she thought she could be ready. At 3:45, she's still not ready, her clothes are only slightly dry, and she's naked. The author gets frustrated, yells at her, waits until 4:00, then leaves without her.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to set a clear deadline, warned her earlier. Jill didn't manage her time, leading to the problem. The author felt it was important to be punctual and not disrupt the wedding. But he did raise his voice, which could be seen as harsh. Leaving her behind might be seen as abandoning her, especially as they were going together. However, he waited 15 minutes past the deadline. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill is responsible for her own time management. The author tried to communicate the importance of being on time. But leaving her might not be the best solution. Maybe he should have waited longer or helped her get ready instead of leaving. However, the situation is a recurring issue, so there's a pattern here.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a valid reason to leave? Was his reaction reasonable? Was the yelling justified? The author's frustration is understandable, but acting out by leaving and yelling might not be the best approach. However, considering the context of repeated time management issues, maybe his actions weren't entirely his fault. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to set expectations, but leaving might have been a poor choice. However, given that Jill knew the deadline and didn't manage her time, the author might not be entirely wrong. But the yelling and leaving could be seen as harsh. So, there's a balance here. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he tried to set the expectation and waited 15 minutes. However, the yelling is a negative aspect. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving her, and considering the context of her not managing her time, maybe he's not wrong. Alternatively, maybe he should have found another solution instead of leaving. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. But given that the user thinks he's not wrong, and considering the recurring issue, the answer might lean toward B. But others might think he's being impatient. However, the question is if he's in the wrong, and the answer is B.\n"
