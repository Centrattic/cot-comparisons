Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author describes the situation where Jill, their fianc\u00e9e, wasn't ready on time despite being given a clear deadline. The author waited until 4:00 instead of the 3:45 they agreed on, and then left her to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted to be on time and had communicated the need to leave at 3:45. Jill didn't meet that deadline, so the author decided to leave. But the author raised their voice in frustration before leaving, which might be a point of contention. Jill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't account for her laundry not being dry, and was mean for yelling.\n\nOn one hand, the author tried to set a clear expectation and waited an extra 15 minutes. However, yelling could be seen as contributing to the conflict. On the other hand, Jill didn't manage her time as agreed, leading to the situation. The author's intention was to avoid being late, which is a common social norm.\n\nI think the key points are communication and respect. The author communicated the deadline but maybe could have been more understanding of Jill's situation. However, Jill's repeated time management issues might have caused the author to act in frustration. The yelling is a negative aspect, but the decision to leave could be justified if they were going to be late otherwise. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So I'd say B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
