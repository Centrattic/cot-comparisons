Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home to attend a wedding on time.\n\nFirst, the context: They were supposed to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, was still getting ready at 4:00, with slightly damp clothes. The author got frustrated and left, telling her he'd meet her there. Jill is upset because he raised his voice, said the clothes would be dry, and was mean. The author feels she's being defensive.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author wanted to avoid being late, which he considers rude. He gave a clear deadline (3:45) and reminded her earlier. Jill didn't take it seriously and wasn't ready. The author left, but raised his voice in frustration. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, he did leave her, which could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). Even though he was trying to be on time, leaving her behind might not be considerate. But he was trying to respect the event's schedule. \n\nHe also raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, which is disrespectful. That's a clear mistake. However, the situation might have been exacerbated by Jill's history of poor time management. But that doesn't excuse the author's actions. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on balancing responsibility for punctuality vs. supporting a partner. Leaving her might be seen as not being supportive, especially if she was in a difficult situation. However, he did wait until 4:00. \n\nIn relationships, communication and support matter. The author's frustration is understandable, but his response (yelling and leaving) might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, Jill's lack of time management led to the problem. \n\nBut the act of leaving her at home could be seen as neglecting her needs. So maybe both have some responsibility. However, the question is specifically about the author. Since he left her, even if she was late, he might be in the wrong for not helping her get ready or waiting longer. \n\nAlternatively, he might have a point in wanting to be on time, but his method (yelling and leaving) was wrong. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he left her in a vulnerable state and raised his voice. However, some might argue that he had a valid reason for punctuality. \n\nBut considering the situation, leaving her might be seen as more of a mistake. So the answer is likely A.\n"
