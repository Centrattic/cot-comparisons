Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about being late to a wedding because the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready on time. The author left her at home because they were going to be late.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they've had similar issues before. They tried to set a clear deadline: leave at 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, clothes were damp, and she was still naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, telling her they'd meet there.\n\nJill is upset because the author yelled, said the clothes would dry, and was impatient. The author thinks Jill is defensive and in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points to consider: Did the author have a reasonable plan? They told Jill to start two hours before, which seems like enough time for laundry. But maybe Jill didn't start in time, leading to the delay. The author chose to leave to avoid being late, which could be seen as respecting the event's timing, but leaving the fianc\u00e9e behind might be considered harsh.\n\nThe author raised their voice, which is yelling, which is definitely unkind. Even if frustrated, yelling is not a good response. However, the main issue is leaving. Was there an alternative? Like asking for help or compromising? Maybe the author should have given more time or communicated better instead of leaving. But considering they wanted to be on time, their decision might be seen as prioritizing punctuality over waiting for Jill. However, leaving someone at home for something like this might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if Jill wasn't fully to blame. Maybe Jill didn't plan well, but the author could have handled it better. The yelling definitely adds to the problem. So, the author might be in the wrong for yelling and leaving, even if they had a reason. It's a mix of both, but in terms of the main action (leaving), maybe the author is at fault for not handling the situation more calmly and compassionately.\n"
