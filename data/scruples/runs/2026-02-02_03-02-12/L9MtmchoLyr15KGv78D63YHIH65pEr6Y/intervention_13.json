Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The fianc\u00e9, let's call him Will for clarity, had a conversation with his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, about leaving on time. He told her they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time for the 4:30 wedding. She said she'd be fine. Then, when it came time to leave, she wasn't ready by 3:45, and Will left her at home, arriving at the wedding late. He raised his voice in frustration before leaving.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication, expectations, and actions. Will had set a clear time to leave (3:45) to make it on time. Jill didn't meet that time, so he left. He was worried about being late, which he considers rude. However, he did raise his voice, which could be seen as aggressive. But he also tried to communicate the urgency multiple times.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel that Will didn't support her or give her enough time. She was stressed about getting ready, and maybe she thought she could make it even if the clothes were slightly damp. Her being left behind might make her feel abandoned, especially since it's a wedding, which is important.\n\nThe question is whether Will was in the wrong. Factors to consider: Did he act out of frustration appropriately? Did he give her enough time? Did he communicate clearly? He did set the time, but maybe he could have been more understanding. However, he also followed through with his plan when she wasn't ready. \n\nLeaving her might have been impulsive, but he had a valid concern about punctuality. The argument might be about how he handled the situation rather than the decision to leave. The yelling is a negative point, but leaving might be a consequence of his frustration. It's a tough call. Some might say he should have stayed and helped her, but others might agree that she needed to be held accountable for being on time. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If Will has raised this issue before, maybe there's a pattern, but in this specific incident, he followed through with his own plan. So, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. However, based on the information, the author's actions were to ensure punctuality, which he values, and he followed through. The answer might be B, but there's nuance.\n"
