Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, let's call him Will, is asking if he's in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The event started at 4:30 PM, and Will was planning to leave at 3:45 PM. He gave a heads-up about the time, but Jill wasn't ready in time, so he left alone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Will mentions that Jill isn't good with time management and they often end up late. He was stressed about being on time, which he finds respectful. He gave her a 30-minute window from 3:45 to 4:00, but she wasn't ready. He raised his voice in frustration, then left. Jill is upset because he raised his voice, said the clothes would be dry, and was mean.\n\nSo, the main issues here are time management and communication. Will tried to set clear expectations, but maybe he could have handled the situation differently. Raising his voice is a problem because it's a form of yelling, which is disrespectful. Even if Jill was late, yelling isn't the solution. However, he did wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the original deadline. He left to avoid being late to the wedding, which is understandable. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, leaving without her might seem harsh, but if the wedding is important and he didn't want to walk in late, that's a valid concern. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and then leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh. The key points here are communication and how he expressed his frustration. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, Will's response of yelling and leaving could be seen as contributing to the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, Will tried to be proactive by giving a time deadline. He might have felt that leaving was the only option to avoid being late. But he could have tried to be more patient or found another solution, like helping her get ready or negotiating the time differently. \n\nJill's reaction is also important. If she's defensive, maybe she's in the wrong for not managing her time, but Will's actions were reactive. In a relationship, how you handle stress and conflict matters. Yelling and leaving without communication can cause more harm than good. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether Will's actions were proportionate. He gave a clear deadline, she didn't meet it, he got frustrated, and left. But yelling and leaving alone might be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe he's partially at fault for the yelling, but not entirely in the wrong for leaving if the wedding was important. However, the community might have mixed opinions. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often look for who made the bigger mistake. Will's mistake was yelling and leaving, which could be seen as inconsiderate, especially to his fianc\u00e9e. Jill's mistake was not managing her time and not meeting the deadline. So, maybe both are at fault, but the question is if Will is in the wrong. If the community focuses on the yelling and leaving as the main issue, the answer might be A (Yes). If they see the importance of punctuality and the context of previous issues, maybe B (No). I'm leaning towards B because the main issue is Jill's time management, but the yelling complicates it. However, leaving her at home might be seen as harsh. Hmm.\n"
