Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because she wasn't ready in time for a wedding they were supposed to attend. The story is structured as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post, which is a common format on forums where people ask if they're being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The author mentions that Jill has a history of poor time management, leading to them being late. He gave her a heads-up to leave by 3:45 PM for a 4:30 PM wedding. He also warned her about the laundry, saying she should start early if she needed two hours. Jill assured him she'd be fine, but at 3:45, she's still not ready\u2014her clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. The author gets frustrated, raises his voice, waits until 4:00, then leaves without her.\n\nNow, the author is defending his actions by stating that he's concerned about punctuality and not wanting to be disrespectful. Jill, on the other hand, is upset because he called her impatient, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and yelled at her. The author feels Jill is being defensive because he thinks she's in the wrong.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B), I need to weigh both sides. On Jill's side, she might feel disrespected by being left. Being left alone on the way to a wedding could be hurtful, especially in a relationship. Her argument is that he didn't support her, didn't check on the laundry, and was mean. On the author's side, he had a valid concern about being late, gave her prior warnings, and felt she was responsible for her time management.\n\nHowever, there are nuances. The author raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling, even if it was frustration. Leaving her home alone might not be the best approach, as it could cause emotional distress. But he did wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline, so he gave her some buffer time. The key here is whether the action of leaving was justified given the prior warnings and Jill's repeated issues with time management.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author might have handled it differently, like talking to her calmly or helping her get ready instead of leaving abruptly. But considering the context of prior similar situations, he might feel it's a recurring problem he can't control anymore. However, leaving someone at home could be seen as abandoning them, even if for a valid reason.\n\nI think the author made a mistake in raising his voice and leaving, but his intentions were to be punctual. Jill's behavior (poor time management) contributed to the problem. However, the act of leaving without her might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, even if he had reasons. So, there's a balance here. The question is whether the author's actions crossed a line. Since the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
