Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding they were supposed to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management, and they often end up late. The author values punctuality and sees being on time as respectful. They planned to leave at 3:45 to arrive by 4:30, but Jill wasn't ready by then, so the author left her at 4:00. \n\nThe author raised their voice in frustration, which Jill now sees as mean. Jill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't account for her laundry timing, and was yelling. The author thinks Jill is in the wrong and defensive.\n\nNow, considering the key points: the author had warned Jill about the time, maybe even twice. Jill didn't start her laundry on time, leading to the clothes being only slightly dry. The author waited until 4:00 before leaving. The author's intention was to not be late to the wedding, which is understandable. However, leaving Jill alone might be seen as abandoning her in an embarrassing situation, especially since she was still in the house naked and not ready.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author might have handled the situation better by staying and helping Jill get ready, maybe offering assistance or finding another solution. Yelling might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. However, the author's frustration is also understandable given the repeated time issues.\n\nThe main issue here is whether leaving Jill was the right action. Even if Jill was at fault for not managing her time, the author's decision to leave could be seen as inconsiderate of her current state (naked, not ready). It could cause emotional distress for Jill, which might be why she's upset. The author's justification is about punctuality and respecting others' time, but relationships also require empathy and support.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be partly in the wrong because they left Jill in a vulnerable position and raised their voice. However, Jill's time management issues contributed to the problem. But the act of leaving someone in such a state could be seen as harsh, regardless of the reason. The author could have handled it more compassionately without abandoning Jill.\n"
