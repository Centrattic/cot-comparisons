Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 leaving his partner, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author (he) is justifying his actions by saying he's not late and values punctuality, while Jill is upset because he was mean and they were going to be late.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a prior conversation where he warned her to start getting ready two hours before they needed to leave. She said she'd be fine, but then wasn't ready by the time it came. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her. \n\nSo, the key points here are communication, expectations, and conflict resolution. The author tried to set a clear time frame, but Jill didn't adhere to it. However, raising his voice and leaving her might be seen as overreacting. Even if she was late, maybe there was a better way to handle it. Maybe he could have given her more time or discussed it calmly instead of yelling and leaving. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that being on time is important and that he didn't want to be late to the wedding. He felt he had warned her enough. But in a relationship, how you handle stress and conflict matters. Yelling might escalate the situation and cause more harm than just being late once. \n\nAlso, the fact that this is a recurring issue (they have this conversation often) suggests that maybe the author should have addressed the underlying problem in a more constructive way instead of reacting in the moment. Leaving Jill alone in that state (naked, clothes not dry) could be seen as inconsiderate and harsh. \n\nJill might be defensive because she feels criticized, but she also contributed by not managing her time better. However, the author's method of handling it could be seen as wrong because of the yelling and leaving her. So, the answer might depend on the balance between the two. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the answer isn't black and white, but in this case, the author's actions of raising his voice and leaving might make him at least partially in the wrong. Even if Jill was responsible for being late, the way the author handled it could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author was right to hold the boundary about punctuality. But the method of enacting that boundary by yelling and leaving could be the issue. So, maybe a mix. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he left her, which could be seen as abandonment in the moment, and used yelling, it's possible he's in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
