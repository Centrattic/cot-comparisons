Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they live 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. He mentioned the laundry situation earlier, and she said she'd be fine. At 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated, yells, and leaves at 4:00 to get there on time.\n\nSo, the main points here are time management issues. Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and the author is stressed about being late. He gave her a heads-up, but she didn't take it seriously. When it comes down to the wire, he can't wait anymore and leaves. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he tried to communicate the timeline and set expectations. He warned her multiple times. When she didn't meet the deadline, he made a choice to leave to avoid being late. That seems reasonable if punctuality is important to him. But he did raise his voice in frustration, which could be seen as being harsh. However, the key issue is that he left her because she wasn't ready, not necessarily because of the yelling. \n\nJill's side is that he's impatient and blamed her for the clothes not being dry. But he didn't force her to use the laundry at that time; he just asked if she needed to include her clothes. She chose to do so, and then maybe didn't account for the drying time properly. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to set clear expectations, but maybe he should have been more flexible or found a compromise. However, given that they had this conversation before, and she still didn't meet the deadline, his actions might be seen as a last resort. \n\nIs it fair to leave someone at home? That could be problematic because it's not safe for someone to be alone at night, and it might have been a panic reaction. But if they were going to a wedding, maybe they had a car and could meet there later. Still, leaving someone unannounced could be hurtful. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but the solution of leaving might not be the best. Maybe a better approach would be to wait a bit longer or talk it out without escalating. However, the core issue is Jill's time management. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing punctuality if they had agreed on the time. But maybe he should have handled it differently. \n\nOverall, while the author had valid reasons for being on time and tried to communicate, leaving Jill might have been a harsh response. However, given that she was responsible for her own time management and he had given her multiple warnings, he might not be entirely at fault. The answer could be a mix, but since the options are A or B, probably B (not in the wrong) because he tried to set expectations and acted based on them, even though the method could be improved.\n"
