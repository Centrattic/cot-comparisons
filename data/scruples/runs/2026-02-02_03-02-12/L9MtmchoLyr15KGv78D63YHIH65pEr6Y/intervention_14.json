Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, who's engaged to Jill, is asking whether it was wrong to leave his fianc\u00e9e at home when they were going to be late to a wedding. They had a conversation earlier where he told her they needed to leave by 3:45 PM to be on time. She said she'd be fine. But when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp from the laundry, and he got frustrated. He raised his voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her, intending to meet her there.\n\nNow, the author is justifying his actions by saying he finds lateness rude and that this is a common issue between them. Jill is upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry (which maybe didn't happen?), and yelled. He thinks she's being defensive.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. First, the issue about time management. The author has a valid point about valuing punctuality. Many people do consider being on time as a sign of respect. However, Jill isn't good at budgeting her time, which has been an ongoing issue. But in this case, he set a clear deadline (3:45 PM) and she said she'd be ready. When she wasn't, he left. That seems logical from his perspective, but maybe he didn't consider that she might need more time than she anticipated.\n\nThen there's the yelling. Raising his voice in frustration is a problem. Even if he was stressed about being late, yelling is a form of aggression and can be hurtful. That's a red flag here. Communication under stress is important, and yelling can escalate conflicts. So even if he felt justified in leaving, the yelling was inappropriate.\n\nAnother point is the laundry situation. He told her the clothes might be dry if she started now. If she started later, they might not be dry. But she said she'd be fine, implying she started on time. If her clothes were slightly damp, maybe that's a factor in why she wasn't ready. However, it's unclear if he assured her they would definitely be dry. If he made a definite statement and it wasn't the case, that's on him. But if he said \"probably\" and she assumed they would be, it's a shared misjudgment.\n\nLeaving her at home: Is it wrong? Well, they're getting married, so this is a significant relationship. Leaving someone behind in a situation like a wedding could be seen as abandoning them, even if the intention was to meet there. But the wedding is a shared event, and showing up separately might not be ideal. However, if the author was determined to be on time and felt that waiting any longer was not an option, he might have thought it was better to go and leave her to come later. But maybe he should have considered alternative solutions, like leaving her a message to come later, or even staying with her to help her get ready, even if they were going to be late together.\n\nAlso, the fact that this is a recurring issue suggests that there might be a need for better communication or compromise. The author could have tried to find a middle ground instead of leaving. For example, if they were going to be late, maybe they could have left earlier than the 3:45 mark to accommodate her time. Or if she needed more time, they could have agreed to be late together but made that decision earlier, not at the last minute.\n\nThe author's justification is that he doesn't want to be late to the wedding, but the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been harsh. Even if he was frustrated, there's a better way to handle the situation without being mean. Also, leaving someone at home when you're both going to an event can be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it's important for them to be there together.\n\nSo, considering all these points: the yelling was definitely in the wrong. Leaving her might be a separate issue. If he left to be on time but didn't consider her feelings or the importance of them attending together, that's a problem. However, if the priority was punctuality and he felt it was necessary to go alone, maybe that's a personal decision. But the combination of yelling and leaving without a clear plan to meet her there might make him at least partially at fault.\n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a nuanced situation. The author's actions were driven by his values (punctuality) but executed in a way that was disrespectful (yelling) and potentially inconsiderate (leaving her behind). So, there are elements where he's in the wrong.\n"
