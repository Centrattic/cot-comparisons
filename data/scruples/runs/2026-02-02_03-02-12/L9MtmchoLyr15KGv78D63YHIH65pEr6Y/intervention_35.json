Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author, let's call them Will for simplicity, and his fianc\u00e9e Jill had a conversation about getting ready for a wedding. Will mentioned they need to leave by 3:45 to be on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45 she wasn't ready. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, didn't tell her the clothes would dry, and yelled. Will feels she's deflecting because she's in the wrong. \n\nNow, considering the factors. Time management is a key issue here. Jill has a history of poor time budgeting, which leads to lateness. Will values punctuality and finds it disrespectful to be late. He gave her a clear deadline and she assured him she could make it. However, she didn't start on time, leading to the problem. \n\nWill's actions: He did give her a heads-up, she didn't follow through. When the time came, he got upset and left. Yelling is a point against him, but the main issue is that he left her. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. Will might have handled the frustration better. Raising his voice isn't ideal. But leaving her at home might have been a decision based on his need to be on time. However, leaving without her could be seen as abandoning her, which is a problem. \n\nBut then, the wedding was 30 minutes away. If he left at 4:00, maybe he could still make it, while she might not have had time to get ready and drive. But he said he'll meet her there, implying he expects her to follow. \n\nThe question is whether Will is in the wrong. On one hand, he didn't consider that maybe she couldn't meet the deadline despite her assurance. On the other hand, she didn't start preparing in time. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often get called out for not considering the other person's perspective. Will might have been too strict, not allowing for the dry time, or not helping her instead of getting angry. However, Jill's repeated behavior could have justified Will's frustration. \n\nBut leaving her behind is a big deal. Even if she was at fault, he could have tried to help her get ready instead of just leaving. So maybe Will did overreact by leaving. However, the main issue is Jill's time management. \n\nSo, is Will in the wrong? I think there are elements on both sides. But the key action is him leaving her. If he left, maybe he's in the wrong for not supporting her despite her mistake. But if he was insistent on punctuality and she kept failing, maybe he had no choice. \n\nI'm a bit torn. But in AITA posts, often the person who leaves is seen as the one in the wrong unless there's a clear excuse. Since he left her behind, that's a problem. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong. But I need to check again. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that he gave her the warning and she didn't take it seriously. So he had a valid reason to leave. But the yelling and leaving might be the issues. \n\nIn many AITA cases, the person's actions that cause direct harm (like leaving someone) are seen as the problem. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. However, the user's initial opinion was that the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nWait, but in the post, Will says he left because he couldn't wait and didn't want to be late. He might have been inconsiderate by not helping her. So maybe A is correct. \n\nI think the answer is A.\n"
