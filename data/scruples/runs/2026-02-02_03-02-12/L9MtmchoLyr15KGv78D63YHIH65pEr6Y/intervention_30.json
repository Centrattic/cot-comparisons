Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author, let's call him Will, explains that they were going to leave by 3:45 to make it on time for a 4:30 wedding. Jill, his fianc\u00e9e, wasn't ready by then, so he left without her, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Will mentions that Jill often has trouble budgeting her time, leading to them being late. He's stressed about being on time and views punctuality as respectful. He did warn her ahead of time to start getting ready early. But when she wasn't ready by 3:45, he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left. Now she's mad, saying he was impatient, made promises about the laundry, and was mean.\n\nOn one hand, Will tried to communicate the deadline clearly. He gave her a heads-up and gave her time. If she was supposed to start early, maybe she's responsible for not managing her time. Leaving might be his way of enforcing punctuality. However, raising his voice and leaving her could be seen as hurtful. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, his reaction might have been harsh. Also, he promised the laundry would be dry, which it wasn't, so maybe he's partially responsible for that. \n\nBut the main question is whether he was in the wrong. Some might argue that he overreacted by leaving her, especially since they're engaged and should support each other. Others might think he's justified if punctuality is important to him and Jill had been warned. The fact that he left her naked and not ready might make people think he was too strict. Also, the yelling adds to the tension. \n\nHmm, but the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Maybe because Jill was warned, and he tried to accommodate her, but she didn't manage her time. However, the emotional aspect of their relationship is important. Leaving might be seen as abandonment, which could hurt feelings regardless of the reason. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural expectations and relationship dynamics. If punctuality is a core value, maybe he's right. But in relationships, sometimes flexibility is needed, especially with loved ones. The yelling is a red flag. Also, maybe he could have found a better way to handle the situation instead of leaving. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because his reaction (yelling and leaving) was harsh, even if Jill was late. But others might side with him if they prioritize punctuality.\n"
