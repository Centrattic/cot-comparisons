Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding. The author, let's call him Will, had told Jill to start their laundry early to ensure it's dry by 3:45 PM, the latest they needed to leave. But at 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and he gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves her at 4:00 PM, saying he'll meet her there.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. Will mentions that Jill isn't good at time management, and they often have issues with being late. He finds it disrespectful to be late, which is a valid point. He set a clear deadline and warned her. When she didn't meet it, he got upset and left. On the other hand, Jill is upset that he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and yelled. \n\nSo, who's at fault here? Will did set a deadline and gave her a heads up. But when she didn't meet it, his response was to raise his voice and leave her. Leaving her at home might be seen as abandoning her in a situation where she wasn't prepared. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, his reaction could have been better. Yelling and leaving might have been harsh. However, considering the context of recurring issues, maybe Will felt justified. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. Maybe Will should have stayed and helped her get ready instead of leaving. Also, raising his voice was unkind. Jill's defensiveness might come from feeling criticized. It's possible that Will's actions, while frustrated, crossed a line. However, the user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI need to decide if Will's actions make him at fault. The key points are: setting a deadline, giving a heads up, but then reacting with frustration. Leaving her might not be the best solution, but if the event was important and he couldn't wait, maybe he had no choice. However, leaving her alone in that state could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. The user is asking for a yes or no. If the options are A (yes) or B (no), I have to pick. Considering that the author made an effort to communicate the deadline, but his reaction (yelling and leaving) was inappropriate, perhaps he shares some fault. But if the main issue is that Jill was at fault for not being ready, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the act of leaving her alone might still be seen as wrong. So maybe A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he left her in a situation where she was unprepared, and the yelling was unkind. Alternatively, B (no) because he tried to set a time and followed through when she didn't meet it. \n\nBut in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, people often look at how the person handled the situation. Even if the fianc\u00e9e was at fault, the response (yelling and leaving) could make the author the asshole. So maybe A is the answer. But some might argue B because the fianc\u00e9e was responsible for her time management. It's a bit tricky. I think the community would split, but leaning towards A because handling it with more empathy is expected in relationships. So, the answer would be A.\n"
