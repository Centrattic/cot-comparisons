Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves a recurring issue where Jill isn't good at time management, leading to them being late. The author planned to leave by 3:45, but Jill wasn't ready by then. He raised his voice and left her, arriving at the wedding without her.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's intention was to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests. They gave a clear deadline, and when that wasn't met, they took action. However, they raised their voice, which is a form of yelling, which is generally considered disrespectful. The act of leaving might be seen as abandoning Jill, but it's to avoid being late to an external event.\n\nJill's side: She's known for being late, as per the author's statements. Her clothes were slightly damp, implying the laundry wasn't dry, which the author thought might happen. She might have overestimated the drying time. Her reaction is that the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry properly, and was mean by yelling. She might feel disrespected.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and conflict resolution. The author gave a clear deadline and a heads-up about the time. However, when Jill didn't meet it, the response was yelling and leaving. Yelling is a problem because it's emotionally charged and not constructive. The author could have handled the situation differently, maybe by discussing the delay calmly and finding a solution rather than escalating the conflict. \n\nThe author's action of leaving might be seen as a necessary step to not miss the wedding, but it's important to consider how this affects the relationship. Leaving a partner in a stressful situation can create more tension. Even though the author thought Jill was in the wrong, their response (yelling and leaving) could have been hurtful and unnecessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention to be on time isn't inherently wrong. However, the method used to achieve that\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014could have been handled better. The author might not be entirely at fault for the lateness (since it's a recurring issue), but the way they handled the conflict does place some responsibility on them.\n\nIn summary, while the author's motivation to be punctual is understandable, their response was unkind and could have been managed more constructively. The yelling was a mistake, and leaving Jill after that might be seen as abandoning her during stress. So, the author is partially at fault for their reaction, even if the situation was frustrating.\n"
