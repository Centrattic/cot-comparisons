Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether they're in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time. They had planned to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding, but she wasn't ready until 4:00. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, looking at the timeline: they had discussed leaving at 3:45. He gave her a heads-up about the time. She said she'd be fine. But when the time came, she wasn't ready. He waited until 4:00, then left. The key points here are communication and expectations. He set a clear time, she assured him she'd be ready. When she wasn't, he acted on the plan they'd discussed. \n\nHe raised his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is never a good way to handle stress, and it could have escalated the situation. However, the decision to leave was based on their prior agreement. He might have felt that staying would make them significantly late, which he considers disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (she was naked and in damp clothes). That's a valid concern. But considering they had this conversation multiple times, maybe he felt it was a recurring issue and needed to set a boundary. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset about being called impatient and defensive. She might feel that her time management was respected in the past, but this time it was taken more seriously. The argument here is about whose responsibility it is to manage the timeline. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, it seems like both parties have some responsibility. The author raised his voice, which isn't ideal. However, the fianc\u00e9e didn't meet the agreed-upon time. The decision to leave was based on their prior discussion, so maybe he's not entirely wrong. But walking out might be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he followed the plan they'd discussed and left when she didn't meet the time. However, the yelling is a negative point. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong for leaving her, and not about the yelling, the main action was leaving. Since they had agreed on the 3:45 departure, he might not be in the wrong. But others might argue that leaving her in that state was wrong regardless. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards B.\n"
