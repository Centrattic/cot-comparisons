Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that they often have this issue with time management. He told her to start the laundry an hour and a half in advance, but she didn't, and then at 3:45, she wasn't ready. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be responsible and on time. Weddings are important events, and showing up late can be seen as disrespectful. He gave her a clear deadline and she didn't meet it. His frustration makes sense in the context of their recurring problem.\n\nOn the other hand, he raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling. Even if he's stressed, using a raised voice might have been hurtful. Also, leaving her before she was ready might have caused her distress. She might feel that he didn't support her or help her get ready instead of just leaving.\n\nBut the author argues that she knows she's in the wrong. He followed through on the deadline he set, and she didn't meet it. The fact that she's defensive suggests she might be aware of her part in the situation. However, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be the problem here. Maybe he could have found a different solution, like helping her get ready instead of just leaving.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both might share some responsibility. The author could have been more patient and found a solution, while Jill could have managed her time better. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he left her to meet the deadline, but in a way that was hurtful, there's a case for AITA (Am I the Asshole). However, since she was unprepared and he had given her a clear warning, maybe he's not entirely to blame.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his actions were the main issue. He left her, but it was in an attempt to be on time. The yelling is a red flag, but the core issue is her time management. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. If leaving is the only option he had to avoid being late, then maybe not. But if he should have stayed to help her instead of just leaving, then yes. I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because he set a deadline she didn't meet, but maybe the execution could be improved. However, the yelling might tip it towards A. Hmm.\n"
