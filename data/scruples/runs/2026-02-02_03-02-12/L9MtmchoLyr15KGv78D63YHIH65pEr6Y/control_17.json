Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (who left their fianc\u00e9e Jill at home before a wedding because they were going to be late) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions they had a prior conversation where they set a 3:45 PM departure time. Jill agreed but wasn't ready by then, so the author left her at home. The key points here are communication, expectations, and how they handled the situation.\n\nThe author did warn Jill about the time, and she said she'd be fine. But when the time came, she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left. Now, Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes were dry, and yelled. The author thinks Jill is being defensive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author did set a clear timeline and gave a heads-up. They had a history of being late, so maybe the author is trying to manage their time responsibly. However, raising their voice and leaving Jill alone might be seen as harsh, even if the author felt justified. Communication is key here. The author might have handled the situation better by staying and helping instead of leaving. Also, maybe there was a way to compromise if they realized she was going to be late, like adjusting the time or making an excuse to the wedding guests. The fact that the author left might come off as abandoning Jill, which could hurt her feelings regardless of the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable due to repeated issues with time management. But in a committed relationship, how you handle stress and disagreements matters. Yelling and leaving could be seen as a lack of support. The author might be in the wrong for the emotional response and the action of leaving, even if the initial problem was Jill's time management. However, there's a balance. Maybe both sides have some responsibility. The author's actions might not be entirely their fault, but they did escalate the situation by yelling and leaving. So, maybe the answer is A (author is at fault) because they could have handled it better, even if Jill's time management was an issue.\n"
