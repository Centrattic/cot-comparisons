Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good with time management, and they often end up late. He made a plan to leave by 3:45, but she was unprepared at 3:45 and still not ready by 4 PM. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her. Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled at her.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author planned to leave at 3:45 and warned Jill to start on time. However, he might have assumed she would be ready by that time without checking in again. Jill didn't meet the deadline, so he left, but maybe he should have given her a second chance or communicated better. Raising his voice was a mistake, but the decision to leave could be seen as reasonable if he didn't want to be late. However, leaving without her might have been harsh, especially if she was unprepared despite his warning. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill has a history of time issues, and the author might have felt justified in trying to meet the commitment. The fact that the clothes were slightly damp suggests maybe the dryer time was underestimated, but the author had told her it would be up to her to manage. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He did raise his voice, which was unkind, but the act of leaving to avoid being late might be seen as necessary. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of just leaving. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is whether he is, the answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations in relationships. \n\nIn many cases, partners are expected to accommodate each other's needs, but there's also a responsibility to meet commitments. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach could have been better. The final decision would hinge on whether the author's actions were proportionate given the circumstances. If he gave ample warning and she still didn't meet the deadline, maybe not in the wrong. But if he could have handled it more calmly, maybe there's some fault on his side. \n\nGiven that he left her at home, which could have been inconvenient for her, but he had a reason (not wanting to be late), the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The user's initial thought is B, so I'll go with that unless there's a strong counterpoint I'm missing. The main issue is whether the action was unreasonable. Since he tried to plan, gave her a heads-up, and she failed to meet the time, leaving might be justifiable. The yelling is a separate issue, but the core question is about leaving, so the answer is B.\n"
