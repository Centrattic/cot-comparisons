Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this situation. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who left their partner, Jill, at home because they were running late to a wedding. The main points here are the timeline and the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. The author set a firm deadline of 3:45 PM to leave. They reminded Jill earlier (at 1:30 PM) about the time needed to get ready and the laundry. Jill, however, didn't start her laundry in time, and by 3:45 PM, her clothes were only slightly dry. The author waited until 4:00 PM, got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and expectations. The author had clearly stated the time constraints multiple times. Jill, knowing this, didn't manage her time effectively. The author's frustration led to raising their voice, which is a point against them. However, the decision to leave was made after waiting an extra 15 minutes, which might be seen as reasonable given the time constraints of the event.\n\nJill's anger stems from feeling that the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry timing, and was mean. The author argues that Jill was aware of the time constraints and that her own time management led to the problem.\n\nIn terms of fault, while the author did raise their voice, the immediate issue was Jill's inability to meet the necessary deadlines despite being warned. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a choice to prioritize punctuality for the event, which others might understand. However, the yelling adds a layer of conflict that complicates things. But the core issue is the time management on Jill's part. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. However, based on the information given, the primary fault lies with Jill for not managing her time, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
