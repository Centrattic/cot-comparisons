Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The wedding is 30 minutes away and starts at 4:30 PM. The author, let's call him Will, told Jill they need to leave by 3:45 latest. Jill said she'd be fine. At 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, so Will gets upset and leaves at 4:00, telling her he'll meet her there. She's upset because he was impatient, yelled, and didn't account for the laundry not being dry.\n\nNow, the question is if Will is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Will was concerned about being late and had warned Jill multiple times. He left to avoid being rude to the hosts. He even waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the 3:45 deadline. He raised his voice, which is a point against him. But his intention was to make the event on time.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill had been warned, and she didn't manage her time well. She knew her clothes might not dry in time but was confident. Will left her not ready, which could be seen as abandoning her. However, he might have felt it was better to go than to be late.\n\nBut did he have to leave her at home? He could have waited a bit longer or tried to help her get ready. Also, raising his voice is a valid criticism. However, considering the repeated issues with time management, maybe he felt it was necessary.\n\nThe key points are: communication beforehand, the actual actions (leaving vs. staying), the yelling, and the impact on their relationship. The user's stance is that Will is not in the wrong because Jill is at fault for poor time management. But leaving a partner not ready might be seen as inconsiderate, even if justified by the intention to be punctual.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether leaving was the best option. Will had given her clear instructions and time warnings. If he left to avoid being late, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the yelling and leaving her in the state she was in could be problematic. However, the question is specifically about being in the wrong for leaving. The user's answer is B (No), and I think that's reasonable given the context, but some might argue that leaving without ensuring she's ready is inconsiderate. But given the details, maybe B is correct.\n"
