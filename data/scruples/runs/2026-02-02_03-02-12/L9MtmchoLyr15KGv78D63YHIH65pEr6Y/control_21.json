Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had agreed to leave by 3:45 PM for a wedding starting at 4:30 PM. The author reminded her at 1:30 PM that they needed to leave by 3:45, but she said she'd be fine. When 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, clothes were still damp, and he got frustrated. He raised his voice and left at 4:00 PM, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nHe argues that she's being defensive because she knows she's at fault. She's upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would be dry, and yelled.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nAuthor's perspective: He tried to communicate the time constraints. He gave a clear deadline. When she didn't meet it, he felt compelled to leave to avoid being late. He raised his voice out of frustration but left her a way to get there (he met her there). He might think she's overreacting.\n\nJill's perspective: She might feel she was given enough time but was pressured, and his yelling was disrespectful. Even if she's at fault for misjudging time, his reaction (raising his voice) could be seen as harsh. Also, he said the clothes would be dry, but they were still damp, which might add to her frustration.\n\nKey points: The author left her at home, which could be seen as abandoning her, even if she had the means to get there. He raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, he did meet her there, so maybe he wasn't completely abandoning her. However, the act of leaving without ensuring she could get there on her own might be problematic.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) analysis, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to avoid being late, but his method involved yelling and leaving her. While time management is on Jill, the author's response might be seen as too harsh. Leaving someone at home when they're not ready could be considered inconsiderate, even if the person is at fault for being late.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration led to yelling, which is generally frowned upon. Even if Jill is responsible for her time, the way he handled it might be the issue here. The author might be in the wrong for how he reacted, even if the situation was frustrating.\n\nBut wait, the wedding was 30 minutes away. If he left at 4:00, maybe he made it on time, but left Jill. She might not have the means to get there on her own? The story doesn't specify if Jill could have gotten there herself. If she couldn't, then leaving her is a problem. If she could, maybe it's less so. The story says he said he'd meet her there, implying he expected her to go alone. But if she wasn't ready and couldn't go, that's a problem.\n\nAdditionally, the author told her the clothes would be dry, but they were slightly damp. That's a point against him\u2014maybe he gave a false assurance, leading to her frustration.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often sides against the person who escalates the conflict with yelling or who abandons someone. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable due to the stress of being late, may cross a line by yelling and leaving her behind.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because of yelling and potentially abandoning his fianc\u00e9e, even if the root issue was her time management. The way he handled it was disrespectful and inconsiderate.\n"
