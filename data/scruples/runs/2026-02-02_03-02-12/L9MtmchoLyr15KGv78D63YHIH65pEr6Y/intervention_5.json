Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, to go to a wedding on time. The situation involves time management issues and a conflict over punctuality.\n\nFirst, the author set a clear deadline (3:45) to leave for the wedding starting at 4:30. Jill assured them she could be ready. However, when 3:45 hits, Jill isn't ready, clothes are damp, and the author gets frustrated. They left at 4:00, causing Jill to be upset. \n\nThe author argues they are not in the wrong because they prioritized being punctual, which they view as respectful. They also mention that raising their voice was a mistake but not the main issue. The fianc\u00e9e feels the author was impatient, not supportive, and made promises about the laundry drying (which might have been unrealistic).\n\nFrom a communication perspective, the author set a clear expectation, but perhaps could have checked in more or offered help. However, given Jill's history of poor time management, the author's frustration is understandable. The key point is whether leaving was justified. Since the author tried to be punctual and gave a reasonable deadline, their actions might be seen as reasonable, especially if they had a track record of this issue. However, yelling might have been a misstep. But the main action\u2014leaving\u2014could be seen as a necessary step to uphold their values of punctuality.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made an effort to plan, but the conflict arises from differing priorities. The answer is B.\n"
