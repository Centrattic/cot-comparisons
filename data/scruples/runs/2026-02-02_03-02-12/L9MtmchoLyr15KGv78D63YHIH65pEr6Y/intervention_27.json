Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author, let's call him Tom, mentions that his fianc\u00e9e Jill has a history of poor time management, which often leads to them being late. They had a specific event starting at 4:30, which is 30 minutes away. Tom told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. He reminded her to start her laundry early, but she didn't. When 3:45 rolled around, Jill wasn't ready\u2014her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still naked. Tom got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, causing conflict.\n\nNow, the main points here. Tom tried to communicate the necessary timeline in advance. He gave a clear deadline and even offered to help with the laundry. Jill, on the other hand, didn't follow through, leading to the situation. Tom's frustration is understandable given their repeated issues with time. However, raising his voice and leaving her in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready) could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut considering the context: Tom was trying to be respectful to the event by not being late. He set clear expectations. Jill's behavior is a recurring problem, and Tom made a choice to proceed without her to avoid further embarrassment. The question is whether Tom overstepped by leaving her alone in that state. \n\nOn one hand, he could have waited a bit more or helped her get ready. On the other, he had already given a clear deadline and the situation was beyond saving. His intention was to keep to the schedule, which is reasonable. The yelling is a point against him, but the core issue is Jill's repeated time management. \n\nSo, is Tom in the wrong? Probably not. He made a difficult decision based on prior patterns and clear communication. However, the way he handled the situation (yelling and leaving her in that state) might be seen as insensitive. But overall, the responsibility lies more with Jill's actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
