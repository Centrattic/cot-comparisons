Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The couple, let's say Will and Jill, have a history of time management issues. Jill isn't good at budgeting time, leading to them being late often. Will is concerned about punctuality, seeing it as respectful to others. The specific incident is a wedding that starts at 4:30 PM, 30 minutes away. They need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. \n\nAt 1:30 PM, Will mentions doing laundry and asks if Jill needs clothes washed. She asks if they'll be dry by the time they leave. Will says probably, and reminds her they need to leave by 3:45. Jill says she'll be fine. But at 3:45, she's still not ready, clothes are slightly damp. Will gets upset, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding alone.\n\nJill is upset because Will called the clothes dry (they were slightly damp), yelled at her, and is impatient. She's defensive, but Will thinks she's in the wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (Will) is in the wrong. Let's analyze both sides.\n\nFrom Will's perspective: He set a clear expectation of leaving by 3:45. He gave a heads-up in advance. He tried to be helpful by offering to do the laundry. When Jill didn't meet the deadline, he felt the need to leave to not be late. He raised his voice out of frustration, but left her a heads-up and intended to meet her there. His reasoning is that he's being responsible and respectful to the event's timing.\n\nFrom Jill's perspective: She trusted that the laundry would be dry, so she waited. She might feel that Will didn't account for the possibility of the clothes taking longer. She could see Will's yelling as unnecessary and mean, making her feel attacked. She might also feel that leaving her behind was abrupt and hurtful, even if he had to go.\n\nSo, potential issues here: \n\n1. Communication: Will told her the clothes would be dry \"probably,\" but they were slightly damp. That might be a miscommunication. Jill might have expected them to be fully dry, assuming that \"probably\" meant yes. Will might not have considered that \"probably\" could lead to some uncertainty.\n\n2. Time Management: Jill struggled with time budgeting as mentioned before. Will had warned her in advance, but she still didn't finish in time. This is a recurring issue, so maybe Will should have set stricter boundaries or helped more with her timeline.\n\n3. Emotional Response: Will raised his voice, which is a form of yelling. Even if frustrated, raising voice can be seen as disrespectful or aggressive. This could have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\n4. Leaving Her: Will left her at home. While he wanted to be punctual, leaving her alone might have been a harsh measure. She was still in the process, and he didn't give her more time or find another solution. Maybe he could have waited a bit longer or communicated better.\n\n5. Responsibility: Both have roles here. Jill didn't meet the deadline, but Will didn't account for the slight dampness. The laundry situation might be a point where Will's assumption was incorrect. He might have overestimated the drying time, or Jill underestimated her preparation time.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in relationships, communication and empathy are key. Will's frustration is understandable, but his response (yelling and leaving) might have been too harsh. Jill's defensiveness might stem from feeling blamed. \n\nAlso, leaving a fianc\u00e9e at home might have made Jill feel abandoned, which could hurt her feelings. Even if Will was trying to be responsible, the method he used could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that he left her to go to the event alone might have been the wrong choice, especially if she wasn't ready yet. Maybe a better approach would have been to stay and help her get ready, or inform the wedding hosts they would be late, rather than leaving her.\n\nAdditionally, the initial assumption about the laundry being dry might have contributed to the problem. If Will said \"probably,\" but didn't confirm, Jill might have planned accordingly, leading to the damp clothes. So Will's assumption here could be part of the issue.\n\nConsidering all that, while Jill did not meet the deadline, Will's actions (yelling, leaving abruptly) might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author (Will) might be at fault to some extent. However, there's also a case for Jill not managing her time better. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on his actions. His emotional reaction and decision to leave could be seen as the wrong part, even if the situation was frustrating.\n"
