Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: They had agreed to leave by 3:45 to be on time for a 4:30 wedding. The fianc\u00e9 reminded Jill earlier to start getting ready in time. She said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hits, her clothes are only slightly dry, and she's not ready. He gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 to avoid being late to the ceremony.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author says he's not trying to be impatient but values punctuality. He left a note about waiting until 4:00 and then left. Jill is upset because he yelled and she thinks he should have waited longer. He thinks she's being defensive.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, both have valid points. The author tried to communicate the deadline multiple times. Jill didn't manage her time well despite the warnings. But raising his voice and leaving her alone might come off as harsh. Even if he was frustrated, yelling could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a relationship. However, leaving her to not miss the wedding could be seen as prioritizing respect for others' time, which is also valid.\n\nThe key points are communication and respect. He had warned her repeatedly, but she didn't take the time seriously. However, his reaction (yelling and leaving) might have been a mistake. Even if she was at fault, the way he handled it could have been better. Maybe he should have tried to calm down and set boundaries without yelling. Leaving her alone might be seen as abandoning her, which could hurt her feelings, especially if she's already stressed.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both need to discuss how to handle time management and conflict. The author's intention was to be on time, but the method of handling the situation might be where he's in the wrong. Yelling and leaving could be seen as impatience and a lack of support. Even if she's responsible for being late, his reaction could escalate the problem. So, while Jill's time management is an issue, the author's approach might not be the best. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. If the main issue is being late to the wedding, and he took action to prevent that, maybe he's not wrong. However, if the problem is the manner in which he left (yelling and abandoning her), then he might be. Since the user thinks he's not wrong, but the community might see his actions as harsh, there's a balance here. The final call would depend on whether the focus is on the outcome (not missing the wedding) or the method (treatment of Jill). Since the user says he's not wrong, but I'm evaluating, maybe the answer is B, but I need to check if there's a consensus. However, in AITA scenarios, the focus is on the actions taken. Yelling and leaving without help might be seen as wrong. So maybe A is the answer. Hmm.\n"
