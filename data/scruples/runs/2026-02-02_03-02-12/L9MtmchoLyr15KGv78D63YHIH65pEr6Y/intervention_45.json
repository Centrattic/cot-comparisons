Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple often has issues with time management. The fianc\u00e9e isn't good at budgeting time, leading to frequent lateness. The author is concerned about being on time and sees it as respectful. In this case, they had a wedding to attend, which started at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 hit, her clothes were still damp, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author's side: He gave a clear deadline (3:45), Jill said she'd be ready. When she wasn't, he left. He thinks she's being defensive. Jill's side: She's upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author set a clear expectation? Yes, he mentioned the 3:45 deadline. Jill, on the other hand, might have expected the clothes to be dry, but the author told her it was up to her. There's a possibility he didn't communicate the time constraints clearly enough, but he did set a time. \n\nRaising his voice is a point against him. Even if frustrated, yelling could be seen as disrespectful. However, the main issue is punctuality. Weddings are important events, and being on time is often considered respectful to the couple. The author prioritized that over staying home. \n\nJill's responsibility is in managing her time. If she's consistently late, maybe the author should address that pattern, but in this case, he made a choice to leave. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a judgment call. He set a time, she didn't meet it. He left, which was his choice. However, the yelling is a negative aspect. But overall, the main issue is about punctuality and personal responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong, but the yelling was a mistake. So, answer B, but with some nuance.\n"
