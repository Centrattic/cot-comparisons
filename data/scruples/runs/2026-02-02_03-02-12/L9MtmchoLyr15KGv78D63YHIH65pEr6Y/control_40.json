Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 leaving his partner because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding they were supposed to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author, let's call him Will, told his fianc\u00e9e Jill that they need to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, her clothes are still damp, and she's not ready. Will gets upset, yells, and leaves at 4:00, telling her he'll meet her there. Now Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't account for the drying time, and was mean.\n\nSo, the key points here. Will had given a clear deadline because he values punctuality. Jill, who knows she has time management issues, didn't start on time. Will's frustration led him to raise his voice and leave without her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, Will was trying to be respectful to the event and their friends by not being late. He set a clear time, maybe even a buffer, since it's 30 minutes away. If they leave at 3:45, arriving at 4:30 is just on time. But Jill didn't meet that, so he had to make a choice. Leaving to avoid being late makes sense for him, but he did raise his voice, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might not have a strong case if she knew she needed more time. However, Will did say her clothes \"would be dry\" if she started in time, which she didn't. So maybe he's being a bit dismissive of her actual needs. Also, leaving her alone, especially in her state (naked, with damp clothes), could be seen as inconsiderate beyond just the time issue.\n\nThe author's argument is that Jill is being defensive. But communication is key here. Maybe Will should have handled the frustration better, but the act of leaving is about prioritizing punctuality over her readiness. However, yelling adds emotional harm. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for the yelling, but the main issue is the decision to leave. \n\nBut is leaving the wrong choice? If they're both responsible for being on time, and Jill didn't meet the agreed time, maybe it's her fault. But if Will didn't account for possible delays (like laundry not drying), that's on him. The initial message from Will said \"probably dry\" but left it up to her. So she took the risk. \n\nSo, AITA? The author's actions led to both missing the wedding start time and leaving Jill behind. The yelling is unhelpful, but the core issue is whether leaving was justified. In relationships, communication is key. Maybe both are at fault. However, the question is about the author. Since he left her behind, even if she was responsible, the act of leaving might be seen as inconsiderate. So, perhaps the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he escalated the situation with yelling and left her in an awkward position. Alternatively, B (No) if he's just holding her accountable for the agreed time. \n\nBut in the AITA context, people often consider both parties' responsibilities. Since the author didn't ensure the laundry would be dry and left the responsibility to her, but still held her to the time, maybe he's partially responsible. The fact that he yelled adds to the problem. So the answer might be A.\n"
