Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, before she was ready for a wedding they were late to. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author says they gave a heads up that they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but clearly wasn't ready by then. The author waited until 4:00 and then left, which is understandable because they didn't want to be late to the wedding. However, they did raise their voice in frustration, which Jill is upset about. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jill should have managed her time better. They mention that this is a recurring issue. On the other hand, Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and yelled. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were reasonable. Leaving when someone isn't ready might be a way to avoid being late, but maybe there's a better approach. However, given the context of a wedding starting at 4:30 and the 30-minute drive, being on time is important. The author did give a clear deadline earlier, so Jill might be at fault for not meeting that. \n\nThe author's frustration leading to yelling might not be acceptable, but the main action here is leaving. The question is whether leaving is the wrong thing to do. Some might say that leaving without the fianc\u00e9e is harsh, especially if she wasn't prepared. Others might argue that respecting the schedule is important and that Jill's time management is the issue. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there could be room for improvement in how they handled the situation, like giving more notice or helping Jill prepare instead of just leaving. But based on the information given, the author tried to communicate the schedule upfront and followed through when the deadline passed. Jill's reaction might be influenced by her own mismanagement. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's a nuance where the author could have handled it better without yelling. However, the core action of leaving to be on time might be justified given the circumstances.\n"
