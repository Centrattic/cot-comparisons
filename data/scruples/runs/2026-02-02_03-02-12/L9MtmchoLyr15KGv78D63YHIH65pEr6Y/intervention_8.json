Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late. \n\nFirst, some context: The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to be on time. Jill said she'd be fine but ended up not being ready by then. The author waited until 4:00, got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nNow, thinking about possible angles. The author's perspective is that they value punctuality and found it rude to be late. They had given Jill a clear deadline and tried to warn her multiple times. When she wasn't ready, they felt it was necessary to leave to avoid being late to the event. They also admitted they raised their voice, which they see as a wrongdoing but still think Jill is in the wrong overall.\n\nJill's perspective is that the author was impatient, maybe didn't account for the laundry not drying in time, and was mean by yelling. She might feel that the author should have given her more leeway or helped instead of leaving her behind.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider responsibility and communication. The author set a clear expectation (leave by 3:45), but maybe didn't account for the laundry taking longer. They could have checked in again closer to the deadline or offered help. However, the author's frustration is understandable given they value punctuality. \n\nLeaving Jill behind might come off as abandonment, which could be hurtful. Even if the author was stressed, walking out might not be the best approach. The raised voice is another point\u2014yelling can escalate tension. \n\nBut the author also mentions that this is a recurring issue, and maybe they felt this was a pattern. Still, in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe the author should have expressed their concerns differently rather than leaving. However, the author's intention was to be respectful to the event's schedule, which is valid. \n\nOn balance, the author took responsibility for their yelling, which is a good point. But leaving a fianc\u00e9e behind might not be the best choice, even if the other person is at fault. It could cause more harm in the relationship than the lateness. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. They had a valid reason to be on time, but their response (leaving and yelling) might have been excessive. However, considering the pattern and the author's perspective, maybe they're not entirely wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because while the author made a mistake in yelling and leaving, the core issue is Jill's time management. The author tried to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The main fault might lie more with Jill, but the author's actions could be seen as a reaction to a recurring problem. However, there's room for both to improve communication.\n"
