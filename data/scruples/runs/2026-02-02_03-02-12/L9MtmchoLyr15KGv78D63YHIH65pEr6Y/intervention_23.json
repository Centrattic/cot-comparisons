Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to get ready for a wedding. The scenario involves time management issues and a conflict over punctuality.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting her time, and they often get stressed when they're running late. The user, let's call him Will, set a clear deadline of 3:45 to leave by 4:30. He warned her at 1:30 to start getting ready. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were damp, and she was still in the house. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00, arriving before the wedding started.\n\nThe key points here are communication, expectations, and actions. Will set a clear expectation and gave a heads-up. Jill, however, didn't manage her time properly despite the warning. Will's frustration led him to raise his voice and leave. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both sides have valid points. Will might feel that he's doing the right thing by being punctual and respectful to others. Jill, on the other hand, might feel disrespected by being left alone and criticized for her preparation. The argument about the laundry\u2014Will said \"probably dry,\" but Jill might have expected him to make sure. However, he did give her control over the laundry, so maybe she's responsible for that part.\n\nThe decision to leave her at home is a gray area. While being on time is important, leaving someone alone might be seen as abandoning them in a stressful situation. However, given the repeated issues with time management, maybe Will felt this was a necessary action to avoid being late again.\n\nIn terms of communication, raising his voice was unhelpful and could have been handled more calmly. But considering the context of past conversations about time, it might have been a moment of frustration.\n\nSo, is Will in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He set clear expectations, which is good, but his reaction (yelling) and leaving her might not address the underlying issue. However, given Jill's history, maybe he had valid reasons. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving her, but some might argue B because of her time management issues. I think it's a nuanced case where both have some fault. But the question is specifically if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but others might say he is for yelling and leaving her. Hmm.\n"
