Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he left his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30 PM. They agreed they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. He told her to start getting ready at 1:30 PM if she needed two hours, but she wasn't ready by 3:45. He got frustrated, raised his voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is concerned about being on time and not wanting to be late, which he sees as disrespectful. He tried to plan ahead, gave her a time to start, and when she didn't meet the deadline, he left. On the other hand, Jill was unprepared, her clothes were only slightly dry, which might have been unexpected. She might feel he didn't account for the possibility of the laundry not drying on time. Also, he raised his voice, which she found mean. \n\nHe argues she's being defensive because she knows she's wrong. But maybe he could have handled it differently. Leaving her might have been impulsive. They're engaged, so communication is key. Maybe he should have discussed the issue calmly instead of leaving. However, she kept missing the time, and he was trying to be respectful to the event. \n\nThe key points are: Did he have a right to leave her? Was his frustration justified? Did he handle it poorly? The fact that he raised his voice is a problem. He could have tried to talk to her after the initial frustration instead of just leaving. But considering the situation, he was trying to be on time. Maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his approach might have been harsh. The answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he left without ensuring she could get there safely or with a plan to meet up later. Also, raising his voice isn't helping. However, some might argue he was trying to be responsible. It's a tough call. I think the consensus would be that he's not entirely in the wrong because he tried to plan, but his handling of the situation (yelling and leaving) was poor. But in the context of the AITA, maybe he's not the main wrongdoer here. Wait, but he left her stranded. If he left, maybe he should have given her another option, like a ride or helping her get there. But he just left her. That's a problem. So maybe he is in the wrong for abandoning her. Hmm. The answer might be A (Yes, he is in the wrong) because he left her without a plan and raised his voice. But some might say she's equally at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he left her, which could be seen as abandoning her, even if she's at fault, maybe he is too. So probably A.\n"
