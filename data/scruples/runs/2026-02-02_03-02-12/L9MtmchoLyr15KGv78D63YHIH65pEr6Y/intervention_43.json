Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, let's call him Tom, is asking if he did the right thing by leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The key points here are communication, expectations, and how they handled the situation.\n\nFirst, Jill isn't good at time management. Tom has mentioned this before, so there's a history of her being late. He warned her at 1:30 that they need to leave by 3:45. She said she'd be fine. But when the time came, her clothes were slightly damp, and she wasn't ready. Tom got frustrated, raised his voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her.\n\nTom's reasoning is that he doesn't want to be late and he didn't want to be rude by arriving late to the wedding. He left because he couldn't wait any longer. Jill is upset because he raised his voice, told her the clothes would dry (maybe implying he thought she should have started earlier?), and called her defensive because she knows she was in the wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether Tom is in the wrong. On one hand, he had a valid concern about timeliness and had given her multiple warnings. He left because he couldn't wait, which might be seen as a last resort. But did he handle it the right way? Raising his voice in frustration might have added to the problem. However, the core issue is Jill's repeated poor time management. Tom tried to communicate the necessary steps earlier, and when she didn't follow through, he acted on his plan. \n\nSome might argue that he should have given her more grace, but considering the recurring issue, maybe his actions were justified. The fact that he waited until 4:00 before leaving shows he tried to be patient. However, leaving her alone could be seen as harsh, especially if she was unprepared. But the main conflict here is about time management and respect for commitments versus personal flexibility. \n\nGiven that Tom had set the expectations early and gave her time to prepare, leaving might be his way of holding the boundary he felt was necessary. The fact that he left her to go to the wedding on time suggests he prioritized punctuality, which is a social courtesy. However, the yelling part is a negative aspect. But the central question is whether he was in the wrong for leaving. Since Jill's behavior was consistent and she didn't follow through, Tom's decision, while perhaps not the kindest, might be understandable. So, I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
