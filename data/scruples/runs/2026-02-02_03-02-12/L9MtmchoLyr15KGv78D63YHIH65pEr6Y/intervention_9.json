Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who left his fianc\u00e9e because they were going to be late to a wedding. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a conversation earlier where he told her they need to leave by 3:45 to make the 4:30 wedding. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45 she's not ready, clothes are damp, and he gets frustrated, yells, and leaves at 4:00.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that Jill is at fault for not being ready on time, leading to the argument. He mentions they have this conversation often, implying it's a recurring issue. He felt it was disrespectful to be late, which is a valid concern. However, he did raise his voice, which can be seen as wrong. Then he left without her, which she's upset about.\n\nOn Jill's side, she might feel that he's being too rigid and impatient. She might have thought she could manage her time, and his reaction was harsh. Also, he told her the clothes \"would be dry\" in their earlier conversation, which might not have been the case, so maybe he contributed by not checking the laundry status. \n\nSo, where's the fault? The author's frustration is understandable given the repeated issues, but yelling is not okay. Leaving her alone at home without ensuring she gets to the wedding could also be problematic. If he left her behind, maybe she had to get there without him, which might cause her more stress. \n\nBut the author left a message saying he'd meet her there, so maybe she could have gone on her own. However, the fact that he left her in the first place might be seen as abandoning her. The key points are his raised voice and the decision to leave. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. He should have tried to resolve the time issue without yelling. Leaving might not be the best solution. So maybe the author is partly in the wrong for the yelling and the decision to leave, while Jill is also at fault for not being ready. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't, but I need to decide. Since he did raise his voice, which is a problem, and left her, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if she was late. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions (yelling, leaving) are problematic, even if Jill was late. Alternatively, if the main issue is her being late, but his response was excessive. So the answer depends on whether the wrong is determined by the actions taken in response to her lateness.\n"
