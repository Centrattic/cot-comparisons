Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context provided. The wedding starts at 4:30 PM, and they live 30 minutes away. The fianc\u00e9 gives Jill an early reminder at 1:30 PM to start getting ready, telling her they need to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest. Jill responds that she'll be fine. Then, at 3:45, Jill isn't ready\u2014her clothes are slightly damp, and she's still naked. The fianc\u00e9 gets frustrated, raises his voice, and waits until 4:00 before deciding to leave without her.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's main arguments are that Jill isn't good at time management, they often run late, and he values punctuality. He left because he didn't want to arrive after the ceremony started. Jill is upset because he yelled, told her the clothes would be dry, and left her behind.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9 tried to plan ahead, set a clear deadline, and gave a heads-up. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the deadline. On the other hand, he raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling, and left without her, which might be hurtful. Leaving someone alone, especially a fianc\u00e9e, in a stressful situation could be seen as callous. Also, telling her the clothes would be dry but not ensuring that might be a point of contention. However, he did give her a heads-up and tried to be responsible.\n\nThe key here is whether the fianc\u00e9's actions were reasonable given the repeated issues with time management. If Jill has a history of being late, perhaps the fianc\u00e9 is trying to hold her accountable. However, the method of leaving without her might be seen as harsh. The yelling is definitely a negative point. The fianc\u00e9 might have handled it differently, like offering help or finding a compromise, instead of just leaving. But given the circumstances, maybe he felt it was the only option to be punctual. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the fianc\u00e9's actions were necessary and if he handled the situation with enough empathy. Since he did give multiple warnings and she still wasn't ready, some might side with him. Others might say that even with repeated issues, the way he handled it was too harsh. But considering the setup, the user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong, and given that the fianc\u00e9 tried to plan and set clear expectations, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, the yelling and leaving might still be problematic. But in the context of the situation, maybe it's a justified action to keep to the schedule.\n"
