Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding because they were going to be late.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at time management, and they often end up late. He had already given her a heads-up about leaving by 3:45 PM for a 4:30 PM event. When the time came, she wasn't ready, and he left. He raised his voice, which Jill is upset about, and she's defensive, thinking he's impatient and defensive about the clothes drying time.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The author tried to communicate the importance of being on time. He told her exactly when they needed to leave. \n2. Jill didn't manage her time well despite being warned. She even said she would be fine, but ended up not being ready. \n3. The author became frustrated, raised his voice, and left. But he did wait until 4:00 (15 minutes past the deadline), which is a reasonable amount of time considering the 30-minute drive.\n4. The author left because he didn't want to arrive during the ceremony, which is understandable etiquette. He didn't want to disrupt the event.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. He did give her a clear deadline. However, yelling could be seen as a poor reaction. But given that this is a recurring issue, maybe his frustration is justified. Leaving alone might have been an extreme action, but he did give her a chance. On the other hand, she might feel abandoned. \n\nBut the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The main question is about leaving her. Leaving alone might not be wrong, especially if he tried to accommodate her earlier (waiting until 4). The fact that she was unprepared despite his warnings could mean he's not at fault. The yelling is a separate issue, but the act of leaving might be more about his need to maintain punctuality, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I should check if there's a cultural or social norm that makes leaving a partner like that inappropriate. However, in many situations, people do have to make tough calls to meet obligations, and if the other party isn't pulling their weight, it's a personal choice. The user's friend might be in a recurring issue, so the author is trying to address the pattern. The key is that Jill's time management is the problem here, not the author's decision to leave. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n"
