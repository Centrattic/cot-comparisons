Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at time management, and this isn't the first time they've had this issue. He tried to plan ahead by telling her to start the laundry early and set a strict departure time. When she wasn't ready by 4:00, he left without her. He raised his voice, which he admits was wrong, but he felt it was necessary to avoid being late to the wedding.\n\nJill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled. The author thinks she's in the wrong for being unprepared.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author tried to communicate clearly. He gave her a specific time to leave and a heads-up about the laundry. When she didn't meet the deadline, he made a choice to leave to be on time. That shows responsibility and consideration for the event's schedule. However, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling. That's a negative action, even if his intention was to be on time.\n\nLeaving her alone could be seen as abandonment, but the context is a wedding where punctuality is important. The author's frustration is understandable given the recurring issue. But is leaving her the right choice? Maybe there's a middle ground, like giving an extra few minutes or helping her get ready instead of leaving abruptly. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's responsibility to be prepared is key here. If she knew the time constraints and still didn't manage her time, she's responsible for her part. But the author's reaction\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been too harsh, even if the root of the problem is her time management. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider if his actions, while perhaps impulsive, were justified given the circumstances. Yelling is never acceptable, but the decision to leave might be seen as trying to uphold commitments. However, the way he handled it (yelling and leaving) could have been better. \n\nIn relationships, communication is vital. Even if Jill was at fault for being unprepared, the author's response could have been more constructive. So maybe the author shares some responsibility for his reaction, but not necessarily for the decision to leave. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we focus on the act of leaving versus the yelling, it's a bit tricky. The yelling is definitely his fault, but the decision to leave might be seen as a necessary action to avoid being late. But the abruptness without offering help or flexibility could be problematic. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but with the caveat that his method of handling the situation could have been better. However, the core question is whether he's in the wrong for leaving. Since Jill was responsible for her own preparedness, and he tried to set clear expectations, leaving might be understandable. The yelling is a separate issue. So the answer is B.\n"
