Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30, 30 minutes away. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, wasn't ready by 3:45, which was the latest they could leave. The author told her to start getting ready two hours earlier, but she was still not ready by the time they needed to leave. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone. Now she's upset, saying he was impatient, mean, and promised the clothes would be dry. He thinks she's defensive because she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author communicated the need to leave on time, gave a heads-up, and Jill didn't manage her time. But he raised his voice and left her. \n\nI need to consider both sides. Time management is a real issue. The author has a valid concern about being on time. But leaving her at home because she wasn't ready\u2014that's a big decision. Even if she was unprepared, is it okay to abandon her in the moment? Also, he raised his voice, which adds to the conflict. \n\nHe mentioned she's usually kind but this time they're at odds. Maybe there's a pattern of her being late, so he might be stressed. But the action of leaving her might be seen as harsh, regardless of the reason. People might argue that even if she was at fault, it's not his place to punish her by leaving. Also, the fact that he yelled\u2014he was disrespectful, which she's pointing out. \n\nOn the other hand, he wanted to be respectful to the hosts and guests by arriving on time. However, taking it out on her by leaving might not resolve the issue and could cause more harm in their relationship. The author might not realize that his actions, while perhaps stemming from frustration, were still hurtful and unfair. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's response might be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong). But maybe some would say he had a right to prioritize being on time. However, the act of leaving her alone is more about his own frustration management. So, likely A.\n"
