Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who left their partner at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The main points are:\n\n1. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management and they often end up late. The author mentions that they have this conversation a lot, implying it's a recurring issue.\n\n2. The wedding starts at 4:30 PM, and they needed to leave by 3:45 PM to arrive on time. The author gave Jill a heads-up at 1:30 PM, suggesting she start getting ready early. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45 PM, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated and left at 4:00 PM, telling her to meet there.\n\n3. Jill is upset because the author raised their voice, told her the clothes would be dry, and called her impatient. The author thinks Jill is being defensive because she knows she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing by leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted to be on time and didn't want to be late to the wedding. They had given multiple warnings. Jill, on the other hand, didn't manage her time well and ended up not being ready. However, the author did raise their voice, which could be seen as yelling. That's a point against them. But given the context, maybe the frustration is understandable.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and prior patterns. The author mentions they have this kind of conversation often. That suggests that Jill might be aware of her tendency to be late and not manage time well. However, the author's response of leaving might be seen as cutting her off without giving her a chance. Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like staying a bit longer or finding another solution. But leaving at 4:00 PM when the wedding starts in 30 minutes could be necessary to avoid being late.\n\nThe author's intention was to be respectful and on time, which is reasonable. However, raising their voice could have been unhelpful and contributed to the conflict. But the main action was leaving, which might be justified if they wanted to be punctual. Jill might feel abandoned, but given the history of her not being ready on time, maybe the author was trying to take responsibility for their own punctuality.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author did plan ahead by setting a time to leave, and gave warnings. The problem is that Jill didn't meet the deadline. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of handling it by leaving without ensuring Jill could get there might be seen as harsh. However, if the author had stayed, they might have been late themselves, which could be worse. \n\nSo, who is more at fault? The author's actions are a response to Jill's consistent time management issues. However, raising their voice and leaving might have been a harsh reaction. But given the recurring problem, maybe the author is justified in trying to enforce punctuality. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable. Leaving to avoid being late is one thing, but the way they handled it (yelling and leaving alone) could be problematic. However, the author's intention was to be on time, which is a valid concern. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the author is not in the wrong because they tried to plan ahead, gave warnings, and acted to avoid being late. The frustration leading to yelling is a mistake, but the main action of leaving to be on time isn't necessarily wrong. Jill's time management is the bigger issue here.\n"
