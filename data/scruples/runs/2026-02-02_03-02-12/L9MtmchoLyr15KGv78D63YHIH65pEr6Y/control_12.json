Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they often have issues with time management, specifically Jill not budgeting her time well. They had a prior conversation where the author warned Jill they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be ready, but when the time came, she wasn't. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her, arriving at the wedding on time. Now Jill is upset, thinking the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The author's main point is that they value punctuality and found it disrespectful to be late. They tried to plan ahead by starting the laundry and setting a clear departure time. When Jill didn't meet the deadline, they felt they had no choice but to leave to not miss the ceremony. On the other hand, Jill might feel disrespected by being left alone, especially in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry), and the raised voice adds to the tension. The author might not have considered that even with the laundry, there could be unexpected delays. However, the author did set a clear time and gave a heads-up. Leaving alone might prevent being late, but it's a harsh action. The yelling is a valid point against the author. \n\nConsidering communication and conflict resolution, yelling isn't helpful. The author might have handled it better by staying calm and discussing the situation. Also, maybe there's a middle ground, like leaving without yelling but still not abandoning Jill. But given the setup of the situation, the author's intention was to meet the time commitment, which is understandable. However, the method of handling it\u2014raising voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as harsh. So there's a mix. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because they had a valid concern about punctuality, but they did escalate the situation with yelling. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for leaving. If leaving was the only way to meet the time, maybe not, but the manner in which it was done could be improved. The main issue is whether the action of leaving was wrong. Since they prioritized being on time and tried to plan, but mishandled the conflict, it's a bit of both. But the initial question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer might hinge on the yelling and the abrupt departure. However, in some contexts, being punctual is valued. Maybe the community would say the author is not in the wrong (B) but should improve communication. Alternatively, some might say they are in the wrong (A) for the harsh reaction. Since the user is asking for A or B, I need to pick based on the details. The key points: the author set a deadline, warned Jill, but when she didn't meet it, left. The yelling is a negative, but the underlying issue is time management. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they tried to plan and had a reason to leave, but the yelling is a fault. However, the question is about leaving, not the yelling. So maybe B. But some might argue that leaving a partner in that state is wrong regardless. Hmm. I think the consensus might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author made an effort to communicate the schedule and had a valid reason to leave to be on time. However, the yelling and the way they left could be seen as inconsiderate. But the main action is leaving, which is not inherently wrong if you've given prior notice. So the answer is B.\n"
