Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author (let's call him Will) left his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because she wasn't ready for a wedding they were supposed to attend. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45 latest. Will gave a heads-up about the time, but Jill wasn't ready by 3:45, still naked, with slightly damp clothes. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00, saying he'd meet her there. Now, Jill is upset, saying he was impatient, didn't let the laundry dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, the main issues here are time management and communication. Will mentions Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often have this issue. He set a clear deadline (3:45) and she didn't meet it. But was leaving her at home the right move?\n\nFrom Will's perspective, he wants to be punctual and doesn't want to be disrespectful by being late. He tried to communicate the time constraints. However, when she didn't meet the deadline, he escalated by yelling and leaving. The key here is how he handled the situation. Yelling is a form of raising his voice in frustration, which could be seen as harsh, especially if she's already stressed.\n\nJill's side is that she felt he was impatient and defensive. She might feel that Will didn't support her or accommodate her need to take more time, even if she misjudged it. The fact that the laundry wasn't fully dry might be a point of contention because Will said he wasn't sure if it would dry in time, but Jill still decided to proceed. If Will had insisted she check the laundry earlier, maybe that could have prevented the issue.\n\nNow, considering the situation, both parties have some responsibility. Jill didn't manage her time well, but Will could have handled the frustration better. Leaving her at home could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready), which is not supportive. Even if he was frustrated, taking off without her might have caused more harm than good. He could have offered help, given her more time in a respectful way, or tried to adjust the plan instead of leaving abruptly.\n\nIn relationships, communication and support are key. While Will's intention was to be punctual, his method of dealing with the problem might have been inconsiderate. He could have approached it with more empathy, understanding that she might be struggling with the time constraints, and offered assistance rather than just leaving. The yelling also adds to the negative reaction from Jill.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while Jill is at fault for not managing her time, Will's actions of yelling and leaving her might make him equally or more at fault for not handling the situation with care and support. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
