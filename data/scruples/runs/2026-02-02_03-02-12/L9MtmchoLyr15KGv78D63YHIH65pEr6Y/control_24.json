Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, were going to a wedding that started at 4:30 PM. The author mentioned they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to be on time. Jill was doing laundry, including her wedding clothes, and the author warned her to start early. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45 PM, she wasn't ready, clothes were damp, and the author left her at home, getting upset and raising their voice.\n\nThe author is being criticized for being impatient, not ensuring the clothes would dry, and yelling. They think Jill is in the wrong for being late. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the author left Jill behind to avoid being late to the wedding. They had a prior agreement about leaving time. Jill didn't manage her time properly, leading to the situation. The author's frustration led to yelling and leaving without her. \n\nOn one hand, the author wanted to be respectful by not being late, which is understandable. They tried to set clear expectations. But leaving a fianc\u00e9e behind, especially in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry), might be seen as callous. Also, raising their voice in frustration is a sign of poor communication.\n\nBut then again, Jill didn't follow through on her end, so the author felt compelled to act. However, the author could have handled it differently. Yelling and abruptly leaving might have been an overreaction, even if Jill was at fault in terms of time management.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they took responsibility for their actions by acknowledging they raised their voice. The core issue is whether leaving Jill behind was justified. The author prioritized punctuality over supporting their partner in a stressful situation. That could come off as selfish, especially if Jill was already stressed about being ready. But the author might argue they were trying to respect the event's timing.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions led to hurting Jill's feelings. Even if Jill was at fault, the way the author handled it could be seen as harsh. So maybe the author is partially at fault for the manner in which they left and the yelling, even if the situation was a result of Jill's time management issues.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community might consider both sides. The author's frustration is valid, but their response could have been more considerate. So perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they chose a harsh action despite the circumstances, even if Jill contributed to the problem.\n"
