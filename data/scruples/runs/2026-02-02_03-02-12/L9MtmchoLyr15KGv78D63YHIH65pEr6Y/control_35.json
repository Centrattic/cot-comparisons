Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, were going to a wedding that started at 4:30 PM, located 30 minutes away. The author mentioned they need to leave by 3:45 PM latest to be on time. At 1:30 PM, the author asks Jill if she wants to do laundry, and they have a conversation where the author sets the 3:45 PM deadline. Jill says she'll be fine. By 3:45 PM, Jill isn't ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. The author gets upset, raises their voice out of frustration, waits until 4:00 PM, then tells Jill they're leaving without her, meeting at the wedding. Jill is upset because the author was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes were dry, and yelled. The author thinks Jill is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions. They gave Jill a clear deadline (3:45 PM) and reminded her earlier. Jill didn't meet that deadline. The author left at 4:00 PM, which is 15 minutes before the wedding starts. The author got frustrated and raised their voice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving.\n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. The author gave a clear warning and allowed some buffer time (leaving 3:45 for a 4:30 event with a 30-minute drive). If Jill didn't meet that, maybe she's at fault for poor time management. But maybe the author could have given more help or flexibility.\n\n2. The author raised their voice. Yelling is generally considered disrespectful, even if frustrated. So maybe the author is wrong for yelling.\n\n3. Leaving Jill behind could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). But the author's reasoning was to avoid being late to the wedding, which they consider important. However, maybe there was another solution, like waiting longer or calling someone to help.\n\n4. The author assumed the clothes would dry, but if they were slightly damp, maybe they didn't. The author might have been wrong to assume that, but Jill also didn't check.\n\n5. The author's motivation: trying to be punctual and respectful to others by not being late. That's a valid point. However, the method (yelling and leaving) could be problematic.\n\nSo, factors to consider: \n\n- Did the author handle the situation calmly? No, yelling happened. That's a negative point.\n\n- Did the author consider Jill's state? She was naked, clothes not dry. Maybe the author could have waited a bit more or helped her instead of leaving.\n\n- Is the author's impatience justified? If they value punctuality, but their reaction was harsh, that's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's consistent time management issues might have led to the problem, but that doesn't excuse the author's yelling and leaving. However, the author felt they were acting in the right to be on time.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations in relationships, communication is key. The author could have handled it better, but the root issue might be Jill's time management. However, the author's actions (yelling and leaving) might be seen as the main issue here.\n\nI think the key points are the yelling and leaving. Yelling is generally not acceptable in most relationships, and leaving someone in that state could be seen as abandonment. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But some might argue that Jill's actions led to the situation (B). But the act of yelling and leaving, especially in frustration, is likely the author's fault.\n"
