Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they need to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45, but she wasn't ready by then. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her at home to go to the wedding alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says they value punctuality and find it rude to be late. They had given Jill a heads-up earlier in the day about the deadline. Jill, on the other hand, was known for poor time management. She said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still not ready. The author waited until 4:00 before deciding to leave.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author made an agreement with Jill to leave at 3:45. If Jill didn't think she could make that, maybe she should have communicated that. But the author also raised their voice, which could be seen as yelling, which is disrespectful regardless of the situation. However, the author's main action was leaving to be on time, which could be seen as necessary if they prioritize punctuality.\n\nBut wait, leaving your fianc\u00e9e at home might be seen as a harsh reaction. Even if she was the one who was late, the author could have waited a bit longer or tried to compromise. However, they did wait until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the deadline. The author's frustration led to yelling, which is a problem, but the main issue is whether leaving her was justified.\n\nJill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry (maybe the author implied they would be dry, but Jill took responsibility for that), and was mean. The author argues that Jill is being defensive because she knows she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they did raise their voice, which is a mistake. But the decision to leave might be seen as a reasonable choice given the importance of punctuality. However, leaving someone at home could be seen as abandoning them, even if they contributed to the problem. It's a bit of a gray area. The author took responsibility for their yelling, which shows they acknowledge a mistake, but leaving Jill might be a separate issue. Maybe the author should have found another solution, like waiting a bit more or helping Jill get ready. But if they felt strongly about being on time, maybe they had to make that choice. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong for leaving, but they did handle the situation poorly with the yelling. So the answer might be B.\n"
