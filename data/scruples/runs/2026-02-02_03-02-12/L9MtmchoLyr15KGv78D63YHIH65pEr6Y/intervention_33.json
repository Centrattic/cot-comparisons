Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context is that they had a history of being late because of Jill's time management issues. The author tried to set a clear deadline (3:45) to get to the wedding on time, but Jill wasn't ready by then. She was still in the process, her clothes were only slightly dry, and he got frustrated.\n\nHe raised his voice, which he acknowledges as a mistake, and then left her at home to go to the wedding alone. Now Jill is upset, saying he was impatient, told her the clothes would dry, and was mean. The author thinks she's being defensive because she knows she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did he have a valid reason to leave, or did he overreact? The wedding starts at 4:30, and the author wanted to leave by 3:45. If they left at 3:45, that's 30 minutes to get there, which is on time. But Jill wasn't ready yet. The author waited until 4:00 and then left. \n\nWas it reasonable to leave her behind? Well, he was trying to be punctual, which he considers important. He gave her a clear timeframe and she didn't meet it. But he also raised his voice, which is a form of yelling, which is not good. However, the main issue is the decision to leave her. \n\nLeaving her at home might be seen as abandoning her, even if she was the one who didn't meet the deadline. However, if he was determined not to be late and she was responsible for her own time management, maybe he had no choice. But still, leaving her behind could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlso, he told her the clothes would be dry, but maybe that's because he thought the dryer would finish in the time she allowed. If she started later than she should have, maybe the clothes wouldn't dry in time. So perhaps he didn't lie, just had a miscalculation.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author might not be entirely at fault for leaving because he was trying to keep to the schedule, but he did yell, which is a problem. However, the main question is whether leaving her was wrong. If they were going to be late, maybe he had a valid reason to go alone. But again, maybe he could have handled it differently, like waiting a bit longer or helping her get ready instead of leaving.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. The answer might be B (No), as he's trying to manage their punctuality, even if his method was flawed.\n"
