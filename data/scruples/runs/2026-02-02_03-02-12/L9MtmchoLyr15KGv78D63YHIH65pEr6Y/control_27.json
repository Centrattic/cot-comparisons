Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which was 30 minutes away. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to arrive on time. Jill, however, wasn't ready by 3:45. She was still in the process of getting ready, her clothes were slightly damp from the dryer, and she was naked. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding alone, arriving early. Jill is upset, feeling that the author was impatient, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and yelled at her.\n\nNow, considering the arguments from both sides. The author's perspective is that they were trying to be respectful by emphasizing punctuality and that they've had this issue with Jill before. They felt that leaving was necessary to not be late, and they think Jill is being defensive because she knows she's at fault. Jill's side is that she was working on getting ready, the laundry wasn't dry as the author had implied, and she's upset that the author left her and raised their voice.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author did raise their voice, which is a clear point of conflict. Yelling in frustration is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful, regardless of the situation. That's a red flag. Also, the author made a decision to leave without considering that Jill might still be in the process of getting ready. While punctuality is important, leaving someone behind at home, especially a fianc\u00e9e, can be seen as abandonment in a stressful situation. However, the author tried to address the time early on by setting a deadline, which shows they were trying to manage the situation.\n\nOn the other side, Jill's pattern of poor time management and not adhering to the agreed-upon timeline is problematic. She was aware of the previous issues and didn't take responsibility for meeting the deadline. However, the author's response\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might have been overly harsh. The fact that the author left Jill alone at home, possibly in an undressed state, could be seen as neglectful, especially in an intimate relationship where partners are expected to support each other through stress.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author gave a clear deadline, but maybe the way they communicated the laundry expectation wasn't clear. Jill might have thought the clothes would be dry as the author mentioned, but if the dryer cycle wasn't specified, that's a miscommunication. However, the author is responsible for how their words were interpreted. The stress of being late is valid, but the method of handling it matters.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, being punctual is valued, but so is supporting one's partner. The author's action of leaving might be seen as prioritizing punctuality over the partner's well-being, which could be a point against them. However, the fact that the author was trying to prevent being late (which is socially expected) might mitigate some blame.\n\nThe key points here are the author yelling, which is a clear wrongdoing, and the decision to leave the partner behind, which can be seen as selfish. However, the partner's history of poor time management is a contributing factor. The question is whether the author's actions were excessive given the circumstances.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, if one person takes a stressful situation and escalates it with yelling, they often bear the lion's share of the blame. Leaving the partner behind might be seen as a harsh reaction, even if the partner is at fault for not being ready. The author's response might have been disproportionate, leading to more harm in the relationship than just being a few minutes late.\n\nTherefore, while both parties have faults, the author's actions (yelling and leaving) are more immediately actionable. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
