Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home to avoid being late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the background: The couple often has issues with being late because Jill isn't good with time management. The author (Will?) is particular about punctuality. They had a previous conversation about leaving by 3:45 for the 4:30 wedding. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes are only slightly dry, and she's not ready. The author gets frustrated, raises their voice, and leaves at 4:00.\n\nSo, the main points here are communication, expectations, and how they handled the situation. The author set a clear time to leave (3:45) based on the previous issue. Jill assured them she'd be ready, but then didn't meet that time. The author tried to be helpful earlier by offering to do laundry, which Jill used, but maybe didn't plan accordingly. \n\nThe author left because they didn't want to be late, which they consider disrespectful. However, they did raise their voice, which is a negative action. Jill is upset about the yelling, not being ready, and maybe the author not ensuring the clothes would be dry (though the author said it's up to her if they dry in time). \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they had a plan, but maybe they didn't give Jill enough time. 3:45 is 1.5 hours before the wedding. If the clothes were still slightly damp at 3:45, maybe they needed more time. If the author had given a buffer time, maybe they could have waited a bit more. However, they did wait until 4:00, which is 45 minutes after the planned departure. \n\nThe yelling is a problem. Even if frustrated, raising your voice isn't helpful and can be hurtful. The author's intention was not to be mean but to avoid being late, but their actions (yelling and leaving) might have been too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill didn't meet the agreed-upon time, which she's known for. The author tried to set a clear expectation, but maybe they should have checked in more or given a little more time instead of leaving. \n\nSo, the author might share some responsibility for not managing the situation better, like giving a warning earlier or being more patient. But Jill also has a history of not managing time well. It's a bit of a grey area. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because leaving Jill alone at home could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was at fault. However, the author's priority was respecting the event's timing. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms around punctuality and how relationships handle such issues. If the author had communicated better and maybe waited a bit longer, it could have been handled better. The yelling definitely isn't helpful. So, the author is partially in the wrong for yelling and leaving abruptly, but Jill's behavior also contributed. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is likely A (Yes), because they contributed to the problem with their reaction, even if Jill was also at fault.\n"
