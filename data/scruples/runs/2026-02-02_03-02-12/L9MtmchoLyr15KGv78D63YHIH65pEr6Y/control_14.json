Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late. \n\nFirst, looking at the timeline. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they needed to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. The author told Jill at 1:30 to start getting ready if she needed two hours. She said she'd be fine, but at 3:45, her clothes were still slightly damp and she wasn't ready. The author waited until 4:00, then left.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they wanted to be punctual, which they consider respectful. Jill, on the other hand, didn't adhere to the time set, leading to the conflict. The author raised their voice in frustration and then left. \n\nNow, from Jill's perspective, she might feel that the author didn't support her enough. Maybe she thought the clothes would dry, or maybe she underestimated the time. The author did suggest starting early, but if the laundry was still damp at 3:45, maybe the dryer wasn't working as expected. However, Jill did say she'd be fine, so maybe she didn't communicate the problem until it was too late.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author gave a clear deadline, and Jill didn't meet it. The author's frustration led to yelling, which could have been handled better. But the decision to leave\u2014was that inconsiderate? If the author had stayed, they might have been late, but leaving Jill alone might have been harsh. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong for raising their voice and for leaving, even if their intention was to avoid being late. However, Jill's repeated time issues could be part of the problem. The author's choice to leave could be seen as prioritizing punctuality over their partner's feelings, which might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might have a point about the lateness, but the way they handled it (yelling and leaving) could be seen as wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. If the main issue is the decision to leave, maybe it's a judgment on communication and support. Leaving might be seen as abandoning Jill, even if it was to be on time. \n\nAlternatively, if the author had stayed and was late, that could be a different problem. But the author's action of leaving without Jill might be considered inconsiderate, especially if they expected her to meet them there later. The author might have been wrong for not staying to help manage the situation, instead of just leaving her to handle it alone. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because of the yelling and leaving the fianc\u00e9e behind, even if the underlying issue is Jill's time management. The author's response was harsh and might have been more about their own frustration than supporting their partner.\n"
