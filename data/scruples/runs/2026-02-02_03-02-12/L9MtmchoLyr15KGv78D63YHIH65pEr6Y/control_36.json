Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The author told her they needed to leave by 3:45 latest. She said she'd be fine, but when the time came, she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nNow, considering the key points here: communication between the couple seems to be an ongoing issue. The author had warned her multiple times about the time constraints. However, he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling, and then left her. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and was mean.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author was wrong to leave her. On one hand, he tried to communicate clearly, gave her time to prepare, and wanted to be on time as a matter of respect. On the other hand, raising his voice and leaving her might be seen as abandonment or not considering her situation. Also, the fact that her clothes were slightly damp might be his responsibility since he said he would handle the laundry but maybe didn't. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given past experiences, but the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be problematic. Leaving without her could be seen as not supporting her, especially if she was in a vulnerable state (naked, not ready). There's a balance between respecting commitments and being considerate to a partner. \n\nIn terms of the fianc\u00e9e's reaction, she might feel hurt or embarrassed. The author's actions could have caused her stress and possibly embarrassment at the wedding. While the author's intention was to be on time, the method might have been harsh. \n\nI think the author made a mistake in yelling and leaving. Even with good intentions, those actions can be hurtful. The responsibility isn't entirely on one side. The author might share some accountability for not managing the time better (like starting laundry earlier) and for not handling the situation with more patience and support. Jill might be responsible for not managing her time, but the author's reaction escalated things. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A\u2014author is in the wrong. He had valid concerns but handled it poorly. Yelling and abandoning her isn't the right approach. Communication and perhaps more patience could have resolved it without leaving.\n"
