Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at managing time, which often leads to them being late. The author is conscientious about punctuality, seeing it as respectful. The event is a wedding starting at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45, but she wasn't ready by then. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left alone. Now, she's upset, thinking he was impatient and mean.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author gave a heads-up about the time, and Jill acknowledged she'd be fine. When she wasn't ready, he left. He raised his voice, which is a problem. But the main question is whether he was wrong to leave. \n\nFrom one angle, the author was trying to be considerate and on time. Weddings are important events, and punctuality matters. However, leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home, especially without her, might have been harsh. Even if she was at fault for not being ready, the author's reaction was to yell and leave, which could be seen as impatience and not supportive. \n\nBut wait, he did leave a note or something? The story says he said he'd meet her there. So he didn't abandon her entirely. However, she was still left alone, which might cause emotional distress. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned she's defensive and he thinks she knows she's in the wrong. That might indicate that he believes she's not taking responsibility, but from an outsider's view, maybe he overreacted. Raising his voice and leaving could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of her actions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. The author could have handled the situation better, maybe by trying to help her get ready faster instead of getting angry and leaving. On the other hand, Jill's poor time management led to the problem. But the question is about the author's actions. \n\nLeaving her at home alone, even if she was irresponsible, might not be the best solution. It could be seen as selfish or not supportive. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate or help, and instead reacted with anger. \n\nBut then again, maybe he's not entirely wrong because he was trying to uphold punctuality. However, the method of leaving her behind might cross a line. \n\nI think the key here is that while Jill's time management is an issue, the author's response was to yell and leave, which is a form of emotional harm. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong. But wait, the options are A for Yes (he's in the wrong) and B for No. \n\nAlternatively, some might say it's a shared fault. But the question is specifically about the author. Since he left her alone and raised his voice, which are both problematic, the answer is A.\n"
