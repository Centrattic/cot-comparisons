Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, who's in a relationship with Jill, their fianc\u00e9e, is upset because they had a wedding to attend that started at 4:30 PM. The wedding is 30 minutes away, so they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. The author warned Jill at 1:30 PM that they needed to start getting ready to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine, but then at 3:45, she's not ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and she's still naked. The author gets frustrated, raises their voice, waits until 4:00, and leaves without her, saying they'll meet there. Now Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, made a promise about the clothes being dry, and was mean by yelling. The author thinks Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the author's actions. They gave a clear deadline (leave by 3:45) and reminded Jill at 1:30. Jill, on the other hand, said she could make it but didn't. The author waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. The author raised their voice in frustration, which is a sign of losing their temper. Then they left, choosing to go to the wedding without her. \n\nOn the surface, the author tried to be responsible and punctual, which is a valid concern, especially for a wedding. However, leaving a fianc\u00e9e behind because she's not ready might be seen as harsh or inconsiderate. The author admitted to raising their voice, which is a form of yelling and could be hurtful. \n\nJill's perspective: She might feel disrespected for being left alone. Even if she was unprepared, being left might make her feel like the author didn't support her or trust her to get ready. The author's promise about the clothes being dry might not have been clear, but Jill could feel it was a broken promise if the clothes weren't dry. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jill is being defensive because she knows she's in the wrong. But in arguments, people often deflect blame, so it's possible that both parties have some responsibility. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author overreact by leaving? Was raising their voice justified? Is it fair to expect Jill to meet the deadline and then leave if she can't? \n\nOn one hand, the author tried to communicate the importance of punctuality. On the other hand, leaving without the partner could be seen as abandoning them, even if the author thought it was to avoid being late. The yelling adds to the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, communication and support are important. Even if the author was stressed, yelling and leaving might not be the best way to handle it. However, the author's intention was to be timely, which is understandable, but the method might have been too harsh. \n\nI think the author is partly at fault for raising their voice and leaving, but Jill also shares some responsibility for not managing her time. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author left the fianc\u00e9e and yelled, those actions could be considered wrong, even if the underlying issue was Jill's time management. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of their actions, but there's a nuance. However, given the options, the answer is likely A.\n"
