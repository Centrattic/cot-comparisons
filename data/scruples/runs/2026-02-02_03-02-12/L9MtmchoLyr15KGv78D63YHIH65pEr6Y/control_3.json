Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they did the right thing by leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves Jill, their fianc\u00e9e, who isn't great with time management. The author planned to leave at 3:45, but when Jill wasn't ready by then, they left her at 4:00, which made her upset.\n\nFirst, the author gave a heads-up about the time they needed to leave. Jill said she would be fine. But she didn't start her tasks on time. The author's frustration led them to raise their voice and then leave. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about being left, feeling it was mean, and the author thinks she's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here: communication between the couple, time management issues, and the author's reaction. Did the author have a right to leave? Well, they did warn her, she didn't follow through, and they were trying to be punctual. But leaving her alone at home, even briefly, might be seen as abandoning her. The author did apologize, which shows some remorse. The fianc\u00e9e's defensiveness might be because she feels the author didn't support her enough.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on how the action is viewed. Leaving to make it on time without support could be seen as dismissive, especially since they were going to a wedding together. On the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable given Jill's repeated time issues. However, the act of leaving might have been unconsidered, not just in terms of the event but also their relationship dynamics. The fact that the author raised their voice adds to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, the author's response (raising voice, leaving) might have been too harsh. The author should have tried to help her get ready on time instead of leaving. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their reaction was unhelpful and hurtful, even if Jill's actions contributed to the problem.\n"
