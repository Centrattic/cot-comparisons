Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves Jill not being ready on time, and the author left her at home. The key points here are communication, expectations, and how each person handled the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned that Jill isn't good at budgeting her time, and they often have this issue. He warned her they needed to leave by 3:45, but she said she'd be fine. She ended up not being ready, so he left. He raised his voice, which is a point of contention. He left her at home because he didn't want to be late to the wedding.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he was concerned about being punctual, which is reasonable. He gave a clear deadline, and she didn't meet it. On the other hand, leaving her at home might be seen as abandoning her, especially since they're engaged and supposed to support each other. Also, raising his voice and the way he handled the situation could be seen as harsh.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. They argue that Jill knows she's in the wrong because she's defensive. The author tried to plan ahead, gave a heads up, and when the deadline passed, he acted to meet the time. However, the act of leaving her might have been a mistake because it's not considerate of her feelings and their relationship dynamic. Even if she was at fault for not preparing, the author's response was to leave her alone, which could be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, there's a balance here. The author might have been right in wanting to be on time, but the method of leaving her behind could be problematic. Relationships require compromise, and maybe the author should have handled it differently, like waiting a bit more or finding another solution instead of leaving. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of how he handled the situation, even if the initial problem was Jill's. But some might argue B, saying that he was reasonable in his timing and had a valid reason to leave. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because the action of leaving might be too harsh despite the circumstances.\n"
