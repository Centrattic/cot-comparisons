Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. They decided to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill's clothes were slightly damp, and she wasn't ready until after 4:00. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her at 4:00, telling her they'd meet there.\n\nThe author argues that Jill's poor time management and the fact that she assured them she'd be ready led to the situation. They also mention that they got impatient and yelled, but they left because they didn't want to be late to the wedding. However, Jill is upset because she feels the author didn't support her, was mean by yelling, and didn't account for the laundry not drying properly.\n\nNow, considering communication and conflict resolution in a relationship. The author's frustration is understandable given the recurring time issues, but raising their voice isn't helpful. However, leaving Jill alone when she's not ready could be seen as abandoning her. But the alternative is being late, which the author finds disrespectful. \n\nBut wait, the author did set a clear expectation (leave by 3:45) and gave a heads-up. Jill said she'd be fine, but maybe the author should have given a reminder or offered help. The fact that they yelled might have escalated things. However, the core issue is that the author left Jill to go to the wedding alone. That's a significant action. Is it wrong to leave someone in that situation? It's a judgment call. Some might say the author prioritized punctuality over supporting their fianc\u00e9e, which isn't ideal. Others might see it as a necessary choice given the circumstances. \n\nThe key points are: the author had warned Jill about the timing, she assured them, then wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, yelled, and left. The question is whether leaving is the wrong action. Since they're engaged, this is a personal relationship issue. The author might have a point about Jill's time management, but the way they handled the situation could be problematic. However, the main action of leaving Jill might be seen as inconsiderate, even if frustrated. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they left her in a vulnerable state, even if the timing was an issue. But I need to check if the author's actions were reasonable. If they felt that being on time was important and couldn't wait, leaving might be seen as a choice, but the yelling and not helping might tip it into being in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe they're both at fault. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. Based on common relationship advice, leaving someone stranded because they're not ready might not be the best choice, even if frustrated. The author could have waited or communicated better. So, the answer would be A.\n"
