Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The user wants to know if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had a conversation earlier in the day about needing to leave by 3:45 PM. The author reminded her to start getting ready in time, and she said she'd be fine. Then, when 3:45 hits, she's not ready, they argue, he yells, and he leaves her at home to go to the wedding alone. She's upset because he was impatient, maybe didn't account for the laundry properly, and was mean.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author tried to set a clear time to leave and warned her. Jill, on the other hand, didn't take the time to prepare, leading to the problem. But the author raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling, and left her without waiting. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did try to communicate the importance of being on time. However, he might have made a mistake in how he handled the situation. Yelling can be a red flag in relationships, even if he was frustrated. Also, leaving her behind could have been a hasty decision. But on the other hand, she was aware of the time constraints and didn't meet them. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels he was impatient. But if they had a prior agreement and she didn't adhere to it, maybe the problem is on her side. However, the author's reaction (yelling and leaving) could be seen as harsh, even if the issue was her not being ready. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's actions were justified. If the core issue is that he wanted to be on time and she didn't manage her time, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his method of dealing with it was disrespectful (yelling, leaving her alone), that's a problem. \n\nAnother angle: Relationships require compromise. Maybe the author should have tried to wait a bit longer or communicated better to find a solution instead of leaving. But given that they had this conversation before, and she assured him she'd be ready, maybe he's justified in expecting her to follow through. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's frustration and yelling were inconsiderate. Even if Jill was at fault, the way he handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. So, maybe the author is partially at fault, but not entirely. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the main issue is leaving her, maybe not, but the yelling complicates it. \n\nAlternatively, since they were going to a wedding, being on time is a common social expectation. If she didn't plan accordingly, she's responsible. The author tried to set a time and gave a warning. So the main blame might be on her, making the author not in the wrong. But his yelling is a separate issue. \n\nHmm. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe the community would see it similarly. The answer is probably B (No), but I need to make sure. The key is that the author communicated clearly, she didn't follow through, and he left to avoid being late. That's not his fault. The yelling is a minor point but might not make him in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
