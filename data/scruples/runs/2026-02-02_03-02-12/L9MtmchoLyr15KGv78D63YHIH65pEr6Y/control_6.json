Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues and some raised voices.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time. The author tried to give her a heads-up about leaving at 3:45. They have this conversation often, which suggests a recurring problem. At 3:45, Jill isn't ready, her clothes are slightly damp, and she's naked. The author gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00, telling her he'll meet her there.\n\nThe author says he doesn't want to be late, considering it rude. Jill is upset because he was impatient, told her the clothes would be dry (though he only said \"probably\"), and was mean by yelling. The author thinks she's defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author tried to set a clear time (3:45) and reminded her to start early. Jill, aware of the problem, didn't take it seriously. The author waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the set time. He left to avoid being late, which he considers important. However, he raised his voice, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nLeaving might be a reaction to frustration, but was it necessary? The author's intention was to be punctual, which is understandable. However, leaving Jill at home without her, especially when she's not ready, could be seen as abandoning her. Even if she's responsible for her time, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014might be where he's at fault. \n\nJill's issues with time management are part of the problem, but the author's response (yelling and leaving) escalated the situation. Leaving her home alone when she's not ready could be considered impulsive. The author might have other options, like calling someone to help her get ready or informing the wedding hosts they'd be late. \n\nSo, while Jill's time management is a problem, the author's actions (yelling and leaving) are problematic. He could have handled the stress better. Maybe he's not entirely in the wrong because he was trying to be punctual, but his reaction might make him partly responsible. The question is whether his actions cross a line. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have roles. Jill needs to improve her time management, but the author's response was harsh. However, the main issue is leaving her. If they were going to a public event, perhaps he should have ensured she was okay. Leaving her naked at home might be a safety or consideration issue. \n\nOverall, the author's actions led to a worse outcome. Even if he was stressed, leaving her in that state isn't acceptable. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground. The problem is both have faults, but the question is specifically about the author. His yelling and leaving are his wrongs. So, he's at least partially in the wrong.\n"
