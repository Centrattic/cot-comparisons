Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had planned to leave by 3:45 to make it on time for a 4:30 wedding. The author gave her a heads-up, and she said she was fine, but she wasn't ready by 3:45. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her at 4:00, meeting her there later.\n\nThe author's defense is that he doesn't want to be late, which he considers rude. He's upset because this kind of time management issue happens often. Jill is upset because he yelled, didn't account for the laundry not being dry, and is being called impatient.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. Did he have a valid reason? He wanted to avoid being late, which is a common concern. But he did raise his voice, which could be seen as harsh. Leaving her alone might be seen as abandoning her, even if the intention was to maintain punctuality.\n\nHowever, Jill also has a history of not managing time well. The author warned her early, gave her a heads-up, and she assured him she could make it. If she knew she needed two hours, maybe she should have started earlier. But he assumed the laundry would be dry, which it wasn't. Did he account for that possibility? Maybe not. But he did mention \"probably\" the clothes would be dry, which might have been an oversight.\n\nThe key points are communication and escalation. The author's frustration led to yelling, which is a negative reaction. Leaving without her might be a consequence of his impatience, which Jill perceives as him being in the wrong. But the author thinks Jill is being defensive because she acknowledges her time issues.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could have handled it better. The author could have tried to help her get ready instead of leaving. Jill could have communicated better about needing more time. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. His actions\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be seen as impulsive and disrespectful. But given Jill's repeated behavior, he might feel justified in setting a boundary.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether his actions were reasonable under the circumstances. Some might say he should have waited or found another solution instead of leaving her alone. Others might agree that he had to prevent being late and acted to uphold their commitment to the event.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, the yelling is a point against him. But since the main issue was leaving due to time constraints, and considering Jill's history, it's a close call. The community often leans towards the person who sets boundaries in such situations, especially if the other person has a known issue. So I'll go with B.\n"
