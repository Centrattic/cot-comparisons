Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is \"in the wrong\" for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, located 30 minutes away. The author set a deadline of leaving by 3:45 PM. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, didn't get ready in time, so the author left alone. He raised his voice in frustration before leaving. Now, Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled at her. The author thinks she's deflecting blame.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author tried to set a time (3:45) to leave, which Jill didn't meet. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. He raised his voice, then left. He's worried about being late and respecting others' time. Jill feels he was mean and inconsiderate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the situation is about time management and communication. The author gave a clear deadline, but maybe he could have checked in more. However, Jill didn't manage her time properly despite prior warnings. The author's frustration led to yelling, which is a problem. Leaving her at home seems harsh, but maybe he felt it was necessary to avoid being late. But leaving someone in an emotional state might not be the best approach. The author could have tried to find a solution, like giving her a few more minutes while staying calm, or helping her finish getting ready. Yelling isn't helpful either. So, while Jill is at fault for not managing time, the author's response (yelling and leaving) was also inappropriate. The author could have handled it better without raising his voice and ensuring she was okay after leaving. So, both have some responsibility, but the author's actions crossed a line. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
