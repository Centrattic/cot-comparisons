Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because she wasn't ready on time for a wedding they were supposed to attend.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time, which often leads to them being late. The author mentions they have these time management issues frequently. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest to arrive on time. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, she was still naked, clothes were slightly damp, and she wasn't ready. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left at 4:00 PM. Now, Jill is upset, feeling the author was impatient, lied about the clothes drying, and was mean. The author thinks Jill is defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they were trying to be responsible and respectful to the event's schedule. They had given a clear deadline, and when it wasn't met, they made a decision to leave to avoid being late. However, they did raise their voice, which could be seen as yelling, which is a negative action. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that she trusted the author's advice about the laundry and felt disrespected by being left behind and the yelling.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did give prior notice and a clear timeframe. However, they might have been too rigid or didn't account for possible delays. On the other hand, Jill didn't take the warning seriously and didn't prepare on time. The author's decision to leave at 4:00 PM might have been an overreaction, especially since they could have given her a bit more time instead of leaving, which could have been a better way to handle the situation. But leaving to ensure they didn't disrupt the event could be seen as taking responsibility.\n\nThe yelling is a point against the author. Even if frustrated, raising one's voice can be hurtful. However, the context of being late for a scheduled event might contribute to stress. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to be based on feeling disrespected and not being supported. The author's argument is that they were trying to avoid being late, which is a valid concern, but the method of leaving her behind might be considered harsh.\n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, often the person who makes a snap decision without considering the other's feelings is seen as at fault. But there's also understanding for wanting to avoid being late. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed a line. Leaving someone behind to avoid being late is a significant action. However, the author did give a heads up and left a 45-minute buffer, which is reasonable for a 30-minute drive. If the clothes were slightly damp, maybe they could have done a quicker dry or adjusted. The author might have been too strict, and the yelling adds to the issue.\n\nIn summary, while the author had valid concerns about punctuality, their reaction (yelling and leaving) might be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e wasn't ready, but the author could have handled it differently, like waiting a bit longer and then addressing the issue later. So, the answer might lean towards the author being at least partially in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if the fianc\u00e9e also shares some responsibility.\n"
