Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both perspectives. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting her time, and they often get stressed when they're running late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. The author told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest, which seems reasonable since it's a 30-minute drive. Jill said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, she wasn't ready\u2014still naked with slightly damp clothes. The author got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, telling her he'd meet her there.\n\nNow, considering the details: The author set a clear deadline based on the travel time. Jill committed to being ready by that time but didn't, leading to the lateness. The author was concerned about being respectful to the wedding guests by not arriving late, which is a valid point. However, he raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling, making the situation more confrontational. Then he left her alone, which might be seen as abandonment, especially during a stressful time.\n\nOn Jill's side, she might feel that the author didn't support her through the last minute of getting ready, perhaps expecting her to handle the stress alone. The author's frustration and yelling could have been hurtful, even if his intention was to be on time. Also, leaving her at home when she's not ready might have caused her additional stress or embarrassment if she ended up going alone and late.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author have a valid reason to leave? Yes, to avoid being late. But was the way he handled it wrong? Raising his voice and leaving her might be seen as harsh, especially in a relationship. Communication and support could have been better. The author might have tried to help her get ready instead of just leaving. However, Jill's consistent time management issues might have contributed to the problem. The author's actions could be seen as a reaction to a recurring issue rather than just this one incident.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both might share some responsibility. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of leaving her without support could be inconsiderate. Jill's defensiveness might stem from feeling unsupported. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might be a nuanced \"yes\" because while the intent is valid, the execution could have been better. However, the author's actions might be seen as understandable given the circumstances. The question is whether the means justify the end. In relationships, communication is key, and the author's approach might have been too abrupt and harsh. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and leaving her alone, even if the intention was good.\n"
