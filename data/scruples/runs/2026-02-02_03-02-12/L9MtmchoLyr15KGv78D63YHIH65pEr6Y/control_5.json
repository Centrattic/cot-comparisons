Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. The author planned to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. They warned her earlier, but she didn't get ready in time. At 3:45, she's still not ready, her clothes are damp, and the author gets frustrated. He yells a bit, waits until 4:00, then leaves and goes to the wedding alone.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: They were concerned about being late and respecting the event's schedule. They tried to plan ahead, gave a clear deadline, and when it wasn't met, they made a decision to leave to avoid being late. Leaving might be seen as a way to honor punctuality.\n\nOn Jill's side: She wasn't ready, maybe due to miscalculating drying time. The author's yelling could be seen as harsh. Leaving her alone might have caused her distress, especially in a public event where being late could be awkward.\n\nBut, the key points here are communication and empathy. Did the author handle the situation well? Yelling is definitely a problem. However, the urgency of the event might have justified leaving. But leaving without her could be seen as abandoning her in a stressful moment. Also, the author might have considered alternatives, like calling someone to pick her up or waiting a bit longer if possible, but they chose to leave. \n\nIn relationships, sometimes balancing personal values (like punctuality) with empathy is tricky. The author's actions might be seen as prioritizing their own standards over Jill's feelings, especially since he acknowledged she's not in the right but also did raise his voice. The fact that he left her alone might be the main issue here, even if he was trying to be on time. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for leaving Jill, even if the intention was to be punctual. The yelling and the decision to go alone without ensuring she gets there (like arranging another ride) could be problematic. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
