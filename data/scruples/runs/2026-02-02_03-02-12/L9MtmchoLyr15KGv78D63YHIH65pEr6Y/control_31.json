Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM, which is 30 minutes away. The author, let's call him Will, mentioned at 1:30 PM that they need to leave by 3:45 at the latest. Jill said she'd be fine. But by 3:45, her clothes are slightly damp, and she's still not ready. Will gets upset, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00 PM, telling her he'll meet her there.\n\nThe user wants to know if Will is the asshole here. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nSo, let's look at both sides. On one hand, Will set a clear deadline and gave a heads-up. He was concerned about being on time, which is reasonable. He warned her multiple times. On the other hand, he raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling and unkind. Then he left her, which might be seen as abandoning her, even if he was frustrated. \n\nBut Jill also had a history of not meeting time expectations. She was the one who wasn't ready despite the warnings. The deadline was set by Will, and he gave her a reasonable timeframe. However, leaving her in that state (naked, clothes not dry) might not be the best choice. \n\nIs Will in the wrong? Well, he did get frustrated and yelled, which is a problem. But the main issue is that he left her. Even if she was at fault, leaving her behind could be seen as inconsiderate. He should have maybe tried to help her get ready faster or communicated better. \n\nBut considering that he was trying to be punctual and had given multiple warnings, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the act of leaving her might be seen as selfish, especially if she was unprepared. \n\nAlso, he said the clothes would be dry, but they were slightly damp. That could be a point against him if the dryer wasn't set right. Maybe he should have checked or adjusted the time. But Jill was responsible for putting her clothes in. \n\nIn AITA debates, people often consider both parties' actions. If he set clear expectations and she didn't meet them, maybe he's not the asshole. But raising his voice and leaving her could be seen as the wrong move. \n\nI think the consensus might be that he's not entirely in the wrong because he was trying to stick to the schedule and had warned her. However, he could have handled it better. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the answer is A or B. \n\nWait, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. So if he left her, even though she was unprepared, is that inconsiderate? Or was he right to prioritize punctuality? \n\nI think the key points are: he warned her, she didn't listen, he got frustrated, left her. He might not be the asshole because he tried to be responsible. But leaving her might be seen as harsh. However, considering the context, B (No) might be the answer. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check similar AITA cases. Usually, if someone leaves a partner because they're late despite warnings, it's seen as not the asshole, especially in a public event where being on time is important. The yelling is a fault, but leaving might be justified if the other person repeatedly fails to meet deadlines. So maybe B is correct. But if he left her in a bad state, maybe A. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that he left her might be seen as the problem. Maybe he should have waited longer or helped her. But given that he had already given her multiple chances and a clear deadline, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Jill is at fault for not managing her time, and the author tried to communicate clearly. The yelling is a negative point, but overall, he's not in the wrong.\n"
