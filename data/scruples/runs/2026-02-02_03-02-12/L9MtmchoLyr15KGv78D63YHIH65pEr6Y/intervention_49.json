Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author, let's call them Will, mentions that their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had planned to leave by 3:45 to be on time for the 4:30 wedding. Jill didn't start getting ready until later, and when 3:45 came, her clothes were still slightly damp, and she wasn't ready. Will waited until 4:00, got frustrated, raised their voice, and then left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, Will had set a clear time to leave, reminded Jill earlier to start getting ready, and was stressed about being late. He tried to be polite by telling her to start two hours before, which is reasonable for a 30-minute drive. When she didn't follow through, he waited an extra 15 minutes, which is generous. The fact that he left her at home might have been a mistake, but was it his fault?\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might have felt that Will was being impatient and wasn't considerate of her situation. He did raise his voice, which could be seen as yelling, which is unkind. Also, he told her the clothes would be dry, but they were slightly damp, which might have been a point of contention. However, Will had given a heads-up about the time, so maybe it's Jill's responsibility to manage her time better. \n\nBut is leaving her at home justified? Maybe Will could have tried to be more understanding and helped her get ready instead of leaving. However, given that they were going to be late, and the wedding was important, maybe he felt he had no choice. Still, leaving her alone could be hurtful. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and conflict resolution. Will did communicate the time constraint, but his reaction (raising his voice and leaving) might have been too harsh. Jill's time management issues are a recurring problem, but instead of addressing it calmly, Will reacted with frustration. So perhaps Will is partly at fault for not handling the situation more patiently, even if Jill's actions led to the problem. \n\nIn terms of accountability, while Jill's behavior contributed to the situation, Will's choice to leave her behind and raise his voice could be seen as the wrong action, especially in a relationship where they need to support each other. So maybe the answer is A (yes, he is in the wrong) because of how he handled the situation, even if the root cause was Jill's time management.\n"
