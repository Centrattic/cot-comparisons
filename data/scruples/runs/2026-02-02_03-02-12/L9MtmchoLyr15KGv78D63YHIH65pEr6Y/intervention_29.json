Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before they had to go to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the author tried to plan ahead. They mentioned that Jill isn't good with time management and they often get stressed because of it. They told her to start the laundry early to get it done by the time they needed to leave. But when 3:45 rolled around, the clothes were only slightly dry, and Jill wasn't ready. The author got frustrated and left by 4:00, arriving at the wedding on time. \n\nJill is upset because she thinks the author was impatient, didn't tell her the clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling. The author feels Jill is in the wrong because she didn't manage her time.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and expectations. The author gave a clear timeline: leave at 3:45. Jill said she'd be okay, but didn't account for the laundry taking longer. The author raised their voice in frustration, which is a problem. Yelling can be hurtful even if the situation is stressful. \n\nAlso, leaving without her could be seen as abandoning her, even if it was to be on time. It might have been better to take her, maybe with an apology and help her get ready faster, as being late would be rude to the wedding guests. \n\nBut the author's intention was to avoid being late, which is understandable. However, the way they handled it\u2014raising their voice and leaving\u2014might have been the wrong approach. \n\nSo, while the situation is caused by Jill's time management, the author's response might have been too harsh. They could have handled the stress differently. Maybe they're both at fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they left Jill behind and yelled, that's probably where they went wrong. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
