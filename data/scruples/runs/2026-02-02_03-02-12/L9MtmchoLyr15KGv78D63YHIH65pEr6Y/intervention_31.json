Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author mentions that Jill isn't good with time management, and they had a previous conversation about leaving by 3:45. She wasn't ready, so he left alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was concerned about being late, which they see as disrespectful. They gave a clear deadline, and when it passed, they left. On the other hand, Jill wasn't ready, maybe because the laundry didn't dry. The author raised their voice, which is a point against them. But the situation is recurring, so maybe frustration is justified.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should analyze the key points: communication, prior warnings, the actual event, and the emotional response.\n\nThe author set a time and reminded Jill. When she didn't meet it, he left. While yelling isn't great, the main issue might be the recurring problem. Leaving without her could be seen as abandoning her, but the author's intention was to make the event on time. However, not taking responsibility for ensuring she was ready, maybe he should have helped her dry the clothes or found another solution. Also, leaving her alone might have been harsh, even if he thought she was at fault. The fact that it's a recurring issue could make his reaction more understandable, but the action of leaving might still be wrong. Alternatively, if the deadline was clear and she knew the consequences, maybe he's justified. It's a bit of a toss-up. Considering the situation, maybe the answer is B (no), but I need to check if there's a cultural or social expectation here. In some views, leaving a partner in that situation is wrong regardless of the reason. But the author's intention was to meet the time commitment. Hmm. I think the key is that he didn't make sure she was ready despite knowing her habits. He set a time but didn't follow up. Maybe he should have given her a second chance or helped her instead of just leaving. So perhaps he's partially at fault. But since he had a valid reason to be on time, maybe it's a mix. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is B, then no. If A, then yes. Given that he left her alone, which could be seen as inconsiderate, but given her history, maybe he's not. I'm leaning towards B, but not entirely sure. The yelling is a negative point. But the main issue is the recurring problem and his decision to leave. Since he did leave, but also gave her prior warnings, maybe it's not his fault. So final answer B.\n"
