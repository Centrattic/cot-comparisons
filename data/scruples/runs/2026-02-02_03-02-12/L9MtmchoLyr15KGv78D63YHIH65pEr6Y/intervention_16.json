Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The story describes a recurring issue where the fianc\u00e9e (Jill) isn't good with time management. The author (Will) planned to leave at 3:45, but when she wasn't ready by then, he left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, Will had a valid concern about being late, which he finds disrespectful. He gave a heads-up about the deadline and warned her to start the laundry earlier. His frustration is understandable, especially since this is a recurring issue. He even waited until 4:00 before leaving. However, he raised his voice, which could be seen as yelling, which is part of the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel hurt that he left her, even if she was the one causing the delay. She might feel disrespected, and the fact that the author admitted to yelling adds to her feeling that he was mean. The key points here are communication and the recurring nature of the problem. Will might be trying to manage their time, but his approach could have been better. Instead of leaving abruptly, maybe he could have communicated more effectively, like suggesting they leave a bit earlier next time or helping her get ready. \n\nThe author's reasoning for leaving is to avoid being late, which is a common social concern. However, leaving his fianc\u00e9e in that state (naked, clothes not dry) might have been harsh. Even if she's at fault for not being ready on time, the way the author handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. Yelling and leaving might not be the best response, even if the underlying issue is valid. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. While Will had a reason to be frustrated, the method he used could have been more considerate. Maybe he could have tried to understand why she was struggling with time management, offer support, or set clearer expectations. His action of leaving might have been a last resort, but it's possible that a more compassionate approach could have resolved the situation without causing hurt feelings. \n\nSo, considering both sides, it's a bit of a grey area. However, since the user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong, but also the action of yelling and leaving abruptly might tip the scales. The author's intention was to be on time, but the execution was problematic. Therefore, he might share some responsibility for not handling the situation more thoughtfully.\n"
