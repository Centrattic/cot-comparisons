Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because they were going to be late.\n\nFirst, the context: They had a wedding to attend 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30. The fianc\u00e9, Will, told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 to be on time. Jill didn't start getting ready until later, and by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she wasn't ready. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 to meet her there.\n\nHe's asking if he's in the wrong. Let's look at the key points here. \n\nJill had been warned multiple times about time management. The fianc\u00e9 reminded her to start early because he wanted to avoid being late. She said she'd be fine, but apparently didn't manage her time properly. The wedding is a time-sensitive event, and being late isn't just about being respectful to others; it's also about not missing important parts like the ceremony. \n\nHowever, Will raised his voice in frustration. That's a point against him. Yelling can be seen as disrespectful, even if he's stressed. But the main action in question is leaving her. He left because he didn't want to walk in during the aisle, which is understandable. He prioritized punctuality over waiting for her, which might be seen as a breach of support or partnership. \n\nOn the other hand, Jill's responsibility was to manage her time. If she knew she needed more time, maybe she should have communicated that better. But Will could have handled the situation differently\u2014maybe waited a bit longer but communicated more calmly. \n\nIs it fair to leave her? If the fianc\u00e9 left, maybe he's prioritizing his own stress over her feelings. But if Jill's inconsiderate time management is a recurring issue, maybe he's justified in setting a boundary. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main actions are raising his voice and leaving. Yelling is a clear fault. Leaving might be seen as a consequence but could be a bit of a boundary. However, walking out might not be the best solution. \n\nIn many similar situations, people advise communication and finding solutions together. Leaving alone could be seen as abandonment. But if Jill's behavior is a pattern, maybe Will is trying to enforce accountability. \n\nSo weighing both sides: Will did yell, which is a problem. He also left Jill alone, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the root issue is Jill's time management. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person who acts out in anger is seen as at fault. Raising his voice is a clear issue. Additionally, leaving her might not be the best approach, but if they had this conversation before, maybe it's a recurring problem. \n\nBut the main action is the author's decision to leave. If he left to avoid being late, which is about respecting others' time, but did so in a way that hurt her feelings, it's a mix. However, in AITA terms, the person who acted in a way that caused harm (raising voice, leaving) might be considered at fault. \n\nSo the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the yelling and the decision to leave without a better plan. However, some might argue he's setting boundaries. But the common thread in AITA is often about considering others' feelings. So the answer is likely A.\n"
