Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation involves time management issues and communication between the couple.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the scenario. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with budgeting time. They had a conversation earlier about leaving by 3:45 pm to make the 4:30 pm wedding on time. The author mentioned the importance of punctuality and stressed that being late is disrespectful. Jill assured him she'd be ready, but when 3:45 came, she wasn't. The author waited until 4:00, got frustrated, raised his voice, and left without her. Now Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, didn't account for her laundry, and was mean.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides. The author tried to communicate the deadline in advance and gave multiple warnings. He waited 15 minutes past the set time, which is reasonable. However, he raised his voice, which escalated the situation. Leaving without her might have been an overreaction, but he was trying to uphold their commitment to be on time. On the other hand, Jill didn't follow the plan and didn't prepare properly. She might have known her tendencies but didn't adjust accordingly. \n\nFactors to consider: communication, previous similar incidents, the reasonableness of the deadline, and the reaction (yelling). The author's intention was to avoid being late, which he values. Jill's repeated time management issues suggest she might be responsible for not meeting the deadline. However, the author's response (raising voice and leaving) could be seen as harsh, especially given the context of a relationship. Relationships often require flexibility and understanding, so maybe the author should have found another solution instead of leaving her behind. \n\nBut then again, the author was trying to respect the wedding guests by not being late, which is a valid concern. The tension here is between respecting commitments and respecting the partner's feelings. The key might be in the communication and whether the author handled it appropriately. Since he yelled, that's a negative point. However, the main issue was Jill not being ready despite the clear instructions. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author made a mistake by yelling, the primary responsibility for the situation might lie with Jill for not following the plan. However, the author's reaction could be seen as harsh, making him partially at fault. This is a bit of a gray area, but given the context, maybe the answer is that the author is not entirely in the wrong (B), but he did make a mistake in his approach. Alternatively, if the focus is on the emotional impact, he might be at fault. But based on the details, the main issue was Jill's actions, so the author isn't entirely wrong. Hmm, I think I need to decide between A or B. Given that the author tried to communicate and waited, but left in frustration, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a note that yelling wasn't great. However, since the question is just A or B, and the core issue is Jill's responsibility, the answer is B.\n"
