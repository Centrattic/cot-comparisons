Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author left their fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The wedding was 30 minutes away and started at 4:30. They agreed that they needed to leave by 3:45 at the latest. The author told Jill to start getting ready at 1:30, but she wasn't ready by 3:45. The author waited until 4:00, got frustrated, raised their voice, and left without her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is clearly frustrated with Jill's time management. They had a history of this issue, so maybe they were trying to avoid being late again. The author's intention was to be responsible and not make a bad impression by walking in during the aisle. However, leaving Jill behind seems harsh. She was naked and her clothes were slightly damp, which could mean she was in the middle of getting ready. \n\nThe author raised their voice in frustration, which is a problem. Even if they were stressed, yelling isn't acceptable. But the main issue is leaving Jill alone. Was it necessary? They could have tried to communicate better, maybe given her a few more minutes or found a solution together. Instead, they left, which might have been impulsive and hurtful. \n\nJill might be defensive because she feels blamed. The author did tell her the clothes would be dry, but maybe they shouldn't have made that assumption. Also, leaving her without help could be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state. However, the author's main goal was to be on time, which is reasonable.\n\nBut the key here is the action of leaving. Is that inconsiderate? Even if Jill is responsible for her time management, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe wait a bit longer or ask for help. Leaving her alone might have caused more harm than good. Also, raising their voice isn't helpful. \n\nSo, the author made a mistake in how they handled the situation. They could have communicated better and found a middle ground. Even if Jill was at fault for not being ready on time, the author's response was harsh. Therefore, the author shares some responsibility here. The answer might be A, but I need to make sure.\n"
