Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at time management. They had a history of being late, so the author is stressed about punctuality. They agreed to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. The author reminded Jill to start getting ready in time. However, when 3:45 hits, her clothes are only slightly dry, and she's not ready. He yells at her in frustration, waits until 4:00, then leaves without her.\n\nThe author argues that Jill is at fault for not managing her time, while Jill feels he was impatient and mean. The key points here are about responsibility, communication, and how they handled the situation.\n\nThe author did warn Jill multiple times about the time constraints. He even set a specific time to leave. However, when he got frustrated, he raised his voice. That's a red flag. Yelling can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the situation is stressful. Leaving without her might be a consequence of his frustration, but was it justified?\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's time management is an issue. If she knew she needed two hours, she should have started earlier. But the author should have considered that maybe her estimate was off and tried to help her instead of getting angry.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author did leave her stranded, which is pretty harsh. Even if she was late, there might be a better way to handle it than yelling and leaving. Maybe he could have waited a bit longer or communicated more calmly. The fact that he raised his voice shows poor handling of the situation. So he's partially at fault. However, Jill also failed to meet the time commitments. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he left her and yelled, that's a bigger issue. So the answer might be A, but I need to check again.\n\nWait, the user's options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no. Given that he did raise his voice and left her, which caused her to be upset, even though she's also responsible for her time, his actions were more directly the issue here. So maybe A is correct. But some might argue that he was trying to be responsible by leaving on time. Hmm. However, leaving her alone isn't a solution. He should have either waited a bit more or discussed with her to avoid her being stuck. So yes, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
