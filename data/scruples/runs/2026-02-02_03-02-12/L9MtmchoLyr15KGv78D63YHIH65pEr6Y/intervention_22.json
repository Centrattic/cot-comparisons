Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that Jill isn't good with time management, and they often have issues being late. He wanted to leave by 3:45 to arrive on time. He gave her a heads-up to start getting ready earlier. She said she'd be fine, but when 3:45 came, she wasn't ready, her clothes were slightly damp, and she was still naked. He got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, saying he'd meet her there.\n\nHe argues that she was in the wrong for not being ready, and he was trying to be punctual. She's upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would be dry, and yelled. \n\nThe key points are: Did he have a right to leave? Was his frustration justified? Did he handle it inconsiderately? \n\nHe did set a clear deadline (3:45) and warned her. She said she could make it, but then didn't. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the deadline. However, he raised his voice, which she found mean. \n\nLeaving might be seen as cutting off support, but he was trying to avoid being late. However, yelling may have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. While Jill's time management is an issue, the author's reaction (yelling) might have been inappropriate. Also, leaving might have been harsh, as he could have tried to problem-solve instead of abandoning her. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, seeing Jill's behavior as the main issue. However, there's a middle ground where both could have handled it better. The author's frustration is valid, but his method of handling it (yelling and leaving) might be problematic. \n\nSo, considering that he left her in an undressed, unready state and yelled, which caused her distress, there's a case to say he's partly in the wrong. But if the main issue is Jill's repeated time management problems, maybe he's not entirely wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because leaving his partner in that situation and yelling were unkind and not the best way to handle it, even if his intentions were to be punctual. A better approach would have been to stay and help her get ready instead of escalating the conflict.\n"
