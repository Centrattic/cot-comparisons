Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. The couple had a conversation earlier about leaving by 3:45 PM to get to the wedding on time. The author reminded her to start getting ready early. Then, when 3:45 comes, Jill isn't ready, clothes are slightly damp, and the author gets frustrated. They raised their voice and left at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding alone.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes were dry, and yelled. The author thinks she's being defensive and knows she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, from the author's perspective, he was trying to be respectful by leaving on time. Jill didn't follow the advice to start early, leading to the delay. He left to avoid being late, which he considers rude. But he raised his voice, which might have been unkind.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill might feel abandoned. Leaving a partner alone, even if they're running late, could be hurtful. Also, the author told her the clothes would be dry, but they weren't, which she's pointing out. Maybe he should have checked if the dryer was set for a longer time or offered to help.\n\nIs leaving the right action? Well, he left to meet people there, so he wasn't completely abandoning her\u2014he planned to meet her later. But the act of leaving her unannounced might be considered harsh. Communication and understanding could have been better. Maybe he should have given her a chance to finish or offered assistance instead of just leaving. Yelling also isn't helpful.\n\nIn relationships, how you handle stress matters. Even if Jill is at fault for being late repeatedly, the author's reaction might be part of the problem. There's a balance between being considerate of others' time and supporting one's partner. So maybe both have some responsibility here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's actions (yelling, leaving) might have been impulsive and hurtful. Jill might feel that he didn't support her, especially in a stressful situation. Even if she's usually the one who's late, the way he handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. So perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his response, while trying to be punctual, was harsh and could have been handled more compassionately.\n"
