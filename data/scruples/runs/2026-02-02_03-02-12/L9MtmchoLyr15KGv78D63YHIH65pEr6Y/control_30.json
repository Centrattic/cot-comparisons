Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The couple, let's say the author is Will and the fianc\u00e9e is Jill. They had a wedding to attend starting at 4:30 PM. Will told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM at the latest to be on time. Jill said she'd be ready, but by 3:45, her clothes were still slightly damp, and she wasn't ready. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and at 4:00 PM, he left without her, planning to meet at the wedding. Now Jill is upset, calling him impatient, and says he told her the clothes would dry, implying he knew they wouldn't be ready on time. She also claims he was mean by yelling. The author thinks Jill is being defensive and he's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author's actions: leaving Jill before the event because she wasn't ready. The key factors to consider are his communication, the timing, his frustration, and how he handled the situation.\n\nFirst, let's look at the communication. Will had warned Jill they needed to leave by 3:45. He also mentioned earlier that the laundry might take time, and told her to start if she needed two hours. Jill said she'd be okay. But then, at 3:45, she's not ready, clothes are still damp. So, maybe Will should have checked in more? Or maybe Jill's time management is an issue. But he did give her a head's up. Did he set clear expectations?\n\nNext, the timing. They have a 30-minute drive. If the wedding starts at 4:30, leaving by 3:45 makes sense. If Will left at 4, he's already 5 minutes late. But maybe the drive could be done in 30 minutes, but depending on traffic, maybe? The problem is that Jill wasn't ready, so he had to leave. But is it okay to leave her at home because she's not ready?\n\nThen, the frustration part. He raised his voice. That's a point against him. Even if he's stressed, yelling isn't great. But maybe he was just frustrated from past experiences where they're always late.\n\nNow, the author left her at home. Is that wrong? Well, he couldn't wait indefinitely, but leaving her behind might be seen as abandoning her. Maybe he should have tried to find another solution, like getting someone else to help, or maybe he could have waited longer but was frustrated. Alternatively, maybe he could have gone with her still-damp clothes, but that's not ideal. But he's also concerned about being late.\n\nJill's perspective: she's upset because he was impatient, didn't account for the drying time (maybe he knew the clothes wouldn't be dry but said they \"probably would be\"), and yelled. She might feel that he didn't support her enough, and that he's blaming her for their usual time issues. She might feel that the problem is his impatience and not her time management. But she also might be at fault for not managing her time better.\n\nThe question is whether Will is in the wrong. The author's actions led to leaving Jill behind, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the motivation was to be punctual, the way he handled it\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014might be problematic. However, leaving her because she wasn't ready could be a reasonable decision if he couldn't wait and didn't want to be late. But perhaps he should have handled it more calmly or found a middle ground.\n\nAlso, considering their past interactions, if this is a recurring issue, maybe the problem isn't just the current event but ongoing time management problems. However, in this specific case, the immediate issue is whether Will's actions were acceptable.\n\nAnother angle: did Will give her enough time? He told her to start at 1:30 if she needed two hours. Two hours from 1:30 would be 3:30, which is 15 minutes before the departure time. But if the laundry takes longer, maybe two hours isn't enough. He told her the clothes might be dry, but he also said it's up to her. So maybe he's not responsible for the drying time. But Jill might expect him to take that into account.\n\nThe key points here are that Will left her behind, which could be seen as inconsiderate, and he raised his voice. On the other hand, he had a valid reason to be on time, and Jill's time management is an issue. It's a bit of a gray area. But typically, in such scenarios, the person who leaves the other behind might be considered in the wrong, especially if they had a prior agreement and the other person was not ready. However, the way he handled it (yelling, not helping) adds to his responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author is partially in the wrong because he could have found a better solution instead of leaving her. But Jill is also at fault for not managing her time. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In some perspectives, leaving someone because they're not ready might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if they're your fianc\u00e9e. There's an expectation of support and partnership. So perhaps the answer is A, he is in the wrong, because he left her despite the circumstances, even if she was late. Alternatively, if the main issue is her time management, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nBut in terms of social expectations, being punctual is respected, but leaving a partner behind might not be. So there's a conflict between being on time and being supportive. In many cases, people might side with the author because he tried to be on time, but others might think he should have waited. However, his yelling and not helping might tip the scales towards him being in the wrong.\n\nHmm. I think the answer is A, he's in the wrong. Because leaving her behind could be seen as abandoning her, and he should have handled it more calmly, maybe waited a bit longer or tried to help her get ready. Also, yelling adds to the problem. So the answer is A.\n"
