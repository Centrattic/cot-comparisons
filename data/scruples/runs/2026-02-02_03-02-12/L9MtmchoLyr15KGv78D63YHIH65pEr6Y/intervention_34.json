Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9 mentions that Jill isn't good with time management and they often end up late. He planned to leave by 3:45 to make it on time. He warned her earlier to start getting ready. She said she'd be fine, but by 3:45, her clothes were only slightly dry, and she was still naked. The fianc\u00e9 got frustrated, raised his voice, and left at 4:00, meeting the wedding start time at 4:30.\n\nNow, the key points here are time management, communication, and conflict resolution. The fianc\u00e9 tried to set expectations early, gave multiple reminders, and gave her a clear deadline. However, she didn't meet that deadline. The fianc\u00e9 felt that being on time is important and that she was responsible for her part. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of his reaction. He raised his voice, which Jill interpreted as yelling. Even if he was frustrated, raising his voice could be seen as disrespectful. However, given the context of repeated issues, maybe he felt it was justified. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 left her to go to the wedding, which might have been a way to avoid causing a scene or to be on time. But leaving someone alone when they're not ready could be seen as abandoning them, especially if she was in the middle of getting dressed. However, the fianc\u00e9 might have thought he was making a responsible choice to be punctual.\n\nJill's anger is directed at his impatience, his assurance about the laundry, and his yelling. The fianc\u00e9 argues she's being defensive. It's possible that both have valid points. The fianc\u00e9 tried to plan ahead and communicate clearly, but his reaction might have been harsh. Jill didn't meet her responsibilities and may have been defensive about it.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the fianc\u00e9 did leave her behind, which could be seen as abandonment. However, he had a valid reason related to time management. The yelling complicates things because even if he was frustrated, raising his voice is a negative action. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the fianc\u00e9's actions were justified given the circumstances. While he did have a reason to be concerned about lateness, his approach of leaving her might not be the best solution. However, given that they had this conversation before and she didn't heed the warnings, his decision might be seen as a last resort. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he tried to communicate and plan, but there's a nuance because of the yelling and leaving her alone. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the focus is on leaving her, maybe he is not in the wrong because he had a reason. But if the focus is on the yelling, maybe he is. However, the user's initial thought was that he's not in the wrong. The final answer would be B.\n"
