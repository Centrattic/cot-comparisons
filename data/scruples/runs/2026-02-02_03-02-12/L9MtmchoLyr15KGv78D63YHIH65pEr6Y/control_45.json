Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author, let's call them Will, left his fianc\u00e9e Jill at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The main issue seems to be about time management and communication.\n\nFirst, the setup: They had agreed to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. Jill's clothes were still damp, and she wasn't ready. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her at 4:00. Now Jill is upset, calling Will impatient and blaming him for not ensuring the clothes were dry. Will thinks Jill is in the wrong.\n\nSo, is Will in the wrong? Well, communication is key here. They had a prior conversation where Will warned Jill to start drying her clothes early. Jill said she'd be fine. Then, when the time came, she wasn't ready. Will's frustration led to raising his voice, which is a problem. Yelling is generally not acceptable, regardless of the situation. Also, leaving her alone might have been a poor choice\u2014maybe he should have waited a bit more or at least made sure she was okay on her own.\n\nBut on the other hand, Jill did not manage her time well, which caused the delay. She might have known she needed more time but didn't communicate that. However, Will's response was to yell and leave, which isn't constructive. Even if Jill was responsible for the delay, Will's method of handling it could have been better. Maybe he could have calmed down, discussed the issue without raising his voice, and made sure they both arrived safely.\n\nAnother angle: Leaving a fianc\u00e9e unprepared might be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (naked, clothes not dry). Safety and respect for each other's dignity are important. Even if she's at fault for the delay, Will's actions might have been too harsh.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties have some responsibility. Jill didn't manage her time, and Will reacted with anger instead of patience. But the question is specifically about whether Will is in the wrong. Since he raised his voice and left her, which can be seen as dismissive and harmful, he might share the blame. However, the initial problem was Jill's time management. So, it's a bit of a 50-50 situation, but the act of leaving her might be the bigger issue here, especially if it's the first time or if there's a pattern of this behavior. If this is a recurring issue, maybe they need to address underlying communication problems. But based on this single incident, the immediate blame might lie more on Will's reaction.\n"
