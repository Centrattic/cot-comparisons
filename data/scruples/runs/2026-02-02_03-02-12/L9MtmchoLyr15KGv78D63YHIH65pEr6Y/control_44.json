Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. \n\nFirst, the context: The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. The author, let's call him Will for simplicity, has a history of them being late. The wedding was 30 minutes away, starting at 4:30 PM. Will told Jill they needed to leave by 3:45 PM. Jill said she'd be fine, but at 3:45 she wasn't ready. Will got frustrated, raised his voice, waited until 4:00, then left without her.\n\nSo, the main points here. Will wanted to be punctual and respectful to the wedding guests. He set a clear deadline. Jill didn't meet it. He left her behind because he didn't want to be late. He acknowledged he raised his voice, which is a negative, but his action was leaving her. \n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Leaving someone behind at home, even if they're late, can be seen as abandonment. But the event is a wedding, which is important, and being late is frowned upon. However, leaving a fianc\u00e9e alone in that situation might cause her embarrassment or safety concerns. \n\nOn one hand, Will was trying to be respectful to the event and others, following through on his commitment. On the other hand, leaving Jill without ensuring she could get there herself or with her being upset might not be considerate. Also, the fact that he raised his voice adds to the tension. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because he was impatient, made a promise about the laundry drying, and yelled. The author thinks she's defensive. But maybe both have faults. Will's actions were extreme, but maybe understandable given the circumstances. Jill's poor time management led to the situation. \n\nIn relationships, communication and understanding are key. Will didn't give Jill a chance to get ready in time, even if she miscalculated. Leaving her behind might have been a harsh reaction, but it's also a matter of priorities. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He did act out of frustration and impatience, but the intention was to be punctual. The wrong here is more on Jill for not managing time, but the author's action of leaving her could be seen as inconsiderate. However, without more context on their past interactions or if this was an isolated incident, it's hard to say. But since the question is about the author's wrongness, the act of leaving her might not be the wrong if he had communicated better, but raising his voice is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because he left her without ensuring her safety or considering her feelings, even if she was responsible for the lateness. The key is whether leaving her was an appropriate response. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the fianc\u00e9e was late, the appropriate action might have been to wait a bit longer, help her get ready, or talk it out instead of leaving her behind. Leaving her in that state (naked, clothes slightly damp) could be seen as unkind and inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. The fact that he raised his voice adds to the emotional harm. So, the author made a poor decision and is at fault.\n"
