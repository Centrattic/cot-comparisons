Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home so they wouldn't be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and Jill were going to a wedding that started at 4:30. The author warned Jill they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be ready, but at 3:45, she wasn't. The author got frustrated, raised their voice, and left her to go to the wedding alone.\n\nSo, the main points here are time management, communication, and how the author handled the situation. Jill has a history of not budgeting time well, leading to lateness. The author values punctuality and sees lateness as disrespectful. But the author also raised their voice, which is a point of contention.\n\nThe author left Jill because they didn't want to arrive late. However, leaving a partner behind might be seen as abandonment or not considering her feelings. Jill is upset because she feels the author was impatient, didn't ensure the laundry was dry, and yelled. The author argues that Jill is defensive because she knows she's wrong.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both perspectives. Did the author have a right to leave to avoid being late? Maybe, but perhaps there was a better way to handle it. Yelling and leaving without a plan to meet later could be problematic. Also, the author assumed the laundry would be dry but didn't confirm, which contributed to the problem.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have been stressed about being late, but walking out might not have been the best solution. However, Jill's repeated time issues might have led the author to take drastic action. It's a balance between respecting commitments and supporting a partner.\n\nI think the author is somewhat at fault for raising their voice and leaving abruptly, but Jill's chronic lateness also plays a role. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they left their fianc\u00e9e unprepared and upset, maybe the answer is A. But some might argue that punctuality is important. It's a bit of a toss-up. The key factors are the yelling and leaving without ensuring Jill could join later. That's probably where the author went wrong.\n"
