Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving his fianc\u00e9e at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good at budgeting time. They often end up late or stressed because of that. The author (let's call him Will) mentions that he thinks punctuality is important and that showing up late is disrespectful. For the wedding, which starts at 4:30, they need to leave by 3:45. Will tells Jill to start getting ready at 1:30 because the laundry might take two hours. She says she's fine, but by 3:45, her clothes are only slightly dry, and she's not ready. Will gets frustrated, raises his voice, and leaves at 4:00, saying he'll meet her there. Now Jill is upset because he was impatient, didn't ensure the clothes would be dry, and yelled.\n\nSo, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Will planned ahead, gave a clear deadline, and when that deadline passed, he acted to avoid being late. He followed through on his commitment to punctuality. On the other hand, he raised his voice, which could be seen as harsh, and maybe didn't account for the fact that the laundry wasn't fully dry, which might have been his oversight. Also, leaving her alone might have been a mistake, especially if she needed help or if there was a way to compromise.\n\nBut then again, Jill had been warned multiple times about time management issues, and this isn't the first time this has happened. Will might feel that he's trying to respect others by being on time, and Jill's repeated lack of time management is causing problems. The author's reasoning is that Jill is being defensive because she knows she's wrong. \n\nSo, is Will in the wrong? If he left her because he didn't want to be late, but perhaps there was a way to handle it without yelling and leaving. Maybe he should have tried to help her get ready instead of just leaving. But the fact that they are engaged and have had these conversations before suggests that Jill has a pattern of being unprepared. However, the way Will responded\u2014raising his voice and leaving\u2014could be seen as a harsh reaction. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe both share some blame. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. Since he left her, which could have caused her to miss the wedding or be embarrassed, and he yelled, that seems like he made things worse. However, his intention was to be punctual, which is understandable. \n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and the approach taken. While Jill's time management is an issue, Will's reaction might have been too abrupt. Instead of leaving, maybe he could have given her another 10 minutes or offered help. But given the situation, he wanted to meet the 3:45 deadline, and when that passed, he acted. \n\nI think the answer might be that Will is partially at fault for yelling and leaving without ensuring she could get to the wedding, but Jill is also at fault for not being ready. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B), I need to decide. \n\nMany people might say that while Jill is responsible for her time management, Will's reaction (yelling and leaving) was harsh. So he's in the wrong. Alternatively, others might say that since he tried to plan and she didn't follow through, he's not at fault. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think in relationship scenarios, communication and empathy are key. Leaving her alone and yelling could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention was to be on time. So maybe the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
