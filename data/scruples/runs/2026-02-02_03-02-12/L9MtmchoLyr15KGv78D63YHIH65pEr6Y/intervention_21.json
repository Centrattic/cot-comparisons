Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 (the author) who left his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author argues that Jill isn't good with time management, and he wanted to avoid being late. But he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left her when she wasn't ready.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author planned to leave at 3:45 for a 4:30 start, but Jill wasn't ready until 4:00. He waited until 4:00, told her he couldn't wait anymore, and left. Jill is upset because he yelled, said the clothes would dry, and called her defensive.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, and I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author tried to set a time, gave multiple warnings, and got to the point where he couldn't wait anymore. But he did raise his voice, which is a form of yelling, and left her without her clothes dry. Maybe he could have handled the situation better. Also, leaving her in such a state might be seen as abandoning her. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, not just if he handled it poorly.\n\nPossible arguments against the author: He raised his voice, which is unkind. He left her in an undressed, damp state, which could be seen as neglect. Also, maybe he should have waited a bit longer if the wedding wasn't that strict about time, or found another solution like calling the couple. \n\nBut arguments for the author: He set the time clearly, warned Jill multiple times. Jill knew the consequences. He was trying to respect punctuality, which is a valid concern. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the planned departure. Maybe he felt he had no choice. \n\nThe AITA forums usually look at intent and fairness. The author's intent was to not be late, which is reasonable, but his method involved yelling and leaving her in an awkward situation. Yelling is a red flag. Also, maybe he should have considered that she might need help or that there's a better way to handle the situation without being mean. \n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9e is in a vulnerable state when he leaves. Even if she's at fault for not being ready, leaving her in that state could be seen as harsh. Also, he said the clothes would be dry, but they were only slightly damp. That might have been a point of contention. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, both parties often share some blame. The author raised his voice, which is unkind, and left her in a difficult situation. Jill's poor time management is her fault, but the author's reaction could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong, not if both are. If the answer is A (yes), then the author is in the wrong. If B (no), then not. Considering that he left her in a state where she couldn't go out, and his yelling, it's possible he's in the wrong. However, the initial setup shows that this is a recurring issue, so maybe the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nIn the AITA community, sometimes leaving someone in a bad situation is frowned upon, even if they caused it. So maybe the answer is A. But some might argue that the author had a right to prioritize punctuality and that Jill's time management is her responsibility. \n\nIt's a bit of a toss-up, but the act of leaving her in that state and yelling might tip the balance towards the author being in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
