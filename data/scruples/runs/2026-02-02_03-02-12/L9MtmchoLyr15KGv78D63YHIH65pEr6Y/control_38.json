Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The situation is described as a typical \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author, let's call him Will, mentions that his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, isn't good with time management. They had a conversation earlier about the wedding starting at 4:30, and Will told her they needed to leave by 3:45. Jill said she'd be fine. When 3:45 hits, she's not ready, clothes are slightly damp, and Will gets frustrated. He raises his voice and leaves at 4:00, telling her he'll meet her there. Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient and mean for yelling.\n\nNow, the question is whether Will is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, Will had a valid reason to be on time, as he finds lateness disrespectful. He had given a heads-up about the time, and Jill didn't manage her time properly. He waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes past the agreed time. He left to make it on time, but raised his voice in frustration. The problem here is that he yelled, which could be seen as unkind, even if frustrated. Also, leaving her unprepared might have put her in an awkward position, even if she was the one who wasn't ready.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill did agree to leave by 3:45 and didn't take that seriously. She might have known she couldn't meet the time, leading to the conflict. However, even if she was at fault for procrastinating, Will's response of yelling and leaving abruptly could be seen as harsh. Relationships require communication and understanding. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe Will could have found another way to handle the situation, like helping her get ready or adjusting their plans if they were running late.\n\nSo, while Jill's time management is an issue, Will's reaction of raising his voice and leaving might be where he's in the wrong. He could have handled it more calmly. The key here is whether his response was proportionate. Yelling and leaving in frustration, even if justified by her actions, might not be the best approach. The question is about who is the asshole, so both might share some blame, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA threads, people often consider the intention and the impact. The author's intention was to be on time, but the impact was making Jill feel disrespected and leaving her in an awkward situation. The fact that he left her to go to the wedding without her, even if she wasn't ready, could be seen as abandoning her, which is harsh. However, if the wedding started at 4:30, leaving at 4:00 to be on time might be reasonable, but the yelling is the main issue here. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong for yelling and leaving abruptly, even if Jill was late.\n"
