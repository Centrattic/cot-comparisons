Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is about the author leaving their fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The wedding starts at 4:30, and they had a conversation around 1:30. The author mentioned they need to leave by 3:45 latest to be on time. The fianc\u00e9e, Jill, said she'd be fine. But when 3:45 hits, she's not ready, clothes are damp, and the author gets upset. He raises his voice and leaves at 4:00, telling her he'll meet her there. Now she's upset, thinking he's impatient and mean for yelling.\n\nSo the key points here are about time management, communication, and conflict resolution. The author is frustrated with Jill's repeated tardiness and wants to be punctual, which he sees as respectful. He left because he couldn't wait anymore, but Jill feels he was inconsiderate and harsh. \n\nI should consider both sides. The author did warn Jill about the time multiple times. Maybe he should have set clearer expectations or helped her prepare earlier. But Jill also knew the time constraints and didn't meet them despite being warned. However, raising his voice is a red flag. Yelling in frustration can be seen as disrespectful, even if the intention was to be on time. \n\nLeaving her might have been a selfish decision because he prioritized his own need to be on time over her feelings. Even if she was at fault for being late, the way he handled it\u2014yelling and leaving\u2014could be hurtful. The author might not have considered the emotional impact of his actions. \n\nAlso, the fact that this is a recurring issue (they have this conversation a lot) suggests that maybe the author didn't address the time management problem earlier or in a better way. Maybe he should have been more proactive in helping her plan or communicated differently instead of escalating the situation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had tried to calmly discuss the problem earlier rather than waiting until the last minute to get frustrated, that might have been better. Leaving her alone in that moment could be seen as abandoning her, even if she was late. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were wrong because he raised his voice and left her, which could be hurtful and disrespectful. Even if Jill was responsible for the lateness, the way the author handled the situation was not the right approach. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
