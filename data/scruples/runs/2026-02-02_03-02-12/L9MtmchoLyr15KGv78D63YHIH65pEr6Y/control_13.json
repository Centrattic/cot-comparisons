Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (let's call him Will) left his fianc\u00e9e, Jill, at home before a wedding because they were going to be late. The key points here are the timeline and their communication.\n\nFirst, Will mentions that Jill isn't good at budgeting time, and they often end up late. For this wedding, they needed to leave by 3:45 PM. He told Jill to start getting ready early because the laundry would take time. At 3:45, she wasn't ready, her clothes were just slightly dry, and she was still naked. Will got upset, raised his voice, and left at 4:00 PM to go to the wedding without her, promising to meet there. Now Jill is upset, feeling he was impatient, didn't ensure her clothes would dry, and was mean by yelling.\n\nSo, to determine if Will is in the wrong, I need to consider a few things. First, did he have a valid reason to be concerned about being on time? Weddings are important events, and being punctual is usually considered respectful. He set a clear deadline (3:45) based on the time needed to get there. Jill, on the other hand, didn't meet that deadline, which led to the conflict.\n\nBut then, Will's actions: he raised his voice, which is unkind. Even if he was frustrated, yelling is a poor way to handle the situation. Also, leaving her at home without resolving the issue might be seen as abandoning her in a vulnerable state (she was still naked and not ready). That's a problem. However, the alternative\u2014waiting longer and being late to the wedding\u2014might also be rude or disrespectful to the hosts and guests.\n\nOn the other hand, Jill's responsibility here is clear. If she knew the timeline and agreed to start early, but didn't manage her time properly, that's on her. However, Will's approach could have been better. Instead of yelling and leaving, maybe he could have tried to calmly explain the urgency again, or even offered help. Leaving her in that state might have been harsh, even if the intention was to be on time.\n\nThe question is whether Will's actions were justified. While his intent was to be respectful by arriving on time, the method he used\u2014raising his voice and leaving her unready\u2014might not be the right approach. Communication and empathy are key in relationships, especially when dealing with stress. So, even if Jill is at fault for not being ready, Will's handling of the situation could be seen as wrong because he escalated the conflict and left her in a difficult position.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because of his raised voice and abandoning her, even though the situation was frustrating. Alternatively, some might argue B (he's not in the wrong) because he was trying to be respectful to the wedding guests. But the key is his method of handling it. Yelling and leaving her in that state is where he crosses a line, so A is more likely the correct answer here.\n"
