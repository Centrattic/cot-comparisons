Let me start with my fianc\u00e9e is an amazing woman and we get along really well. She\u2019s typically very thoughtful and kind, but this event has us at complete opposites. \n\nA little background. My fianc\u00e9e, for sake of the convo will be called Jill, isn\u2019t very good at budgeting her time. We tend to be late or I get stressed when we cut it close to meeting times. I find it rude or disrespectful to tell people you\u2019ll be somewhere at a certain time and show up late. Anyway, we had a wedding to attend about 30 min from our house that started at 4:30. At around 1:30 our convo went like this:\n\nMe: I\u2019m going to throw in some laundry, do you need anything thrown in?\nJill: I\u2019ll throw my clothes for the wedding in, Will they be dry by then?\nMe: Probably but up to you. Also as a heads up, we have to leave at 3:45 at the absolute latest to make it on time. If you need two hours, start now. \nJill: I\u2019ll be fine. \n\nWe have this convo a lot. Anyway, 3:45 hits, she\u2019s still naked, her clothes are slightly damp, and she\u2019s not ready. I get a little upset because this always happens and I don\u2019t want to walk in as they are walking down the aisle. To my wrongdoing, I did raise my voice in frustration. I waited until 4:00 and said, \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer. I\u2019ll meet you there.\u201d And I left. \n\nShe\u2019s mad because I am \u201cimpatient\u201d, told her the clothes would be dry, and was mean by yelling at her. I think she\u2019s being defensive because she knows she\u2019s in the wrong. \n\nWhat do you all think? AITA for leaving my fianc\u00e9e?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about leaving the fianc\u00e9e at home because they were going to be late to a wedding. The author mentions that Jill isn't good at time management and they often end up late, which makes him stressed because he values punctuality. They had agreed to leave by 3:45 for a 4:30 wedding. But at 3:45, Jill wasn't ready, her clothes were damp, and he got frustrated, raised his voice, and left to meet her there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning was that they were going to be late, and he didn't want to miss the ceremony. He left to avoid being late, which he considers disrespectful. On the other hand, Jill was upset because he was impatient, didn't account for her time, and yelled at her. \n\nI should check if the author's actions were reasonable. He had given a heads-up earlier (at 1:30) about the time they needed to leave, so Jill should have started getting ready then. However, perhaps he could have given her more leeway, considering her tendency to take longer. But he did set a clear deadline. Also, he waited until 4:00, which is 15 minutes after the deadline. However, he raised his voice in frustration. That might have been unnecessary, even if he was stressed.\n\nLeaving without her might have been a way to avoid being late, but it's also cutting her off from helping her get ready. Maybe there was a middle ground, like staying to encourage her or helping her get ready instead of just leaving. But if he was worried about being late, maybe he had no choice.\n\nThe key points are: Did he give enough notice? Did he communicate clearly? Was yelling justified? And was leaving the only option? The author might not be in the wrong because he was trying to adhere to a punctual schedule, but the yelling and leaving without her could be seen as harsh. However, the situation is complex. Maybe both parties have some responsibility here. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Jill's time management is an issue, and the author tried to set boundaries. However, yelling and leaving might have been an overreaction. So maybe the answer is A, yes, he is in the wrong because he could have handled it differently without raising his voice and by staying to support her instead of leaving. Alternatively, B could be the case if his actions were justified to avoid being late. \n\nHmm. I think the problem is that he left her alone when she wasn't ready. Even if he was stressed, maybe staying and helping would have been better. Also, yelling wasn't helpful. So perhaps AITA is A, he's in the wrong because he could have handled the situation more supportively.\n"
