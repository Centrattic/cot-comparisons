I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is in a long-distance relationship and wants to pursue other girls. They feel like they're not ready for a serious commitment and want to gain experience before finding their \"one.\" The situation is that they met a girl online, had a connection, met up, and things got serious. Now they're worried about the emotional pressure and don't want to hurt her by breaking up, but they also don't want to commit. They consider themselves not a cheater but are planning to be with other girls while maintaining this relationship.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether being in a relationship and pursuing others is ethical. If the relationship isn't exclusive, maybe it's okay, but the user's account suggests they're in a romantic relationship with this girl. They talk about meeting, staying in his room, having sex, and emotional connections. If they're in a monogamous relationship, pursuing others would be cheating. But if they're not in a formal relationship, maybe it's different.\n\nThe user didn't mention discussing exclusivity. The girl said she loves him, so he didn't confirm that, but he didn't say he's in a relationship either. However, the fact that they were meeting and spending time together might imply some level of exclusivity. If he's not honest about his intentions and continues to pursue others without her knowing, that's a problem. The user is conflicted between not wanting to hurt her and their own desire to explore. They also mention they don't want to cheat but fear they might, which shows internal conflict.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and consent are key. If the user is leading her on without being transparent about his intentions to date others, he's being deceptive. Even if they're not officially in a relationship, the emotional investment and physical intimacy could lead to expectations of exclusivity. The user's actions might be causing emotional harm if the girl believes they're exclusive, even if it's unspoken.\n\nSo, the user's main issue is not being upfront about his intentions. If he's not planning to be exclusive, he should communicate that clearly. Alternatively, if he's in a monogamous relationship (even if not officially set), pursuing others is a breach of trust. The fact that he's considering breaking up later shows he's aware of the potential harm but is delaying a difficult conversation. That could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong for not being honest and for leading the girl on while pursuing others.\n"
