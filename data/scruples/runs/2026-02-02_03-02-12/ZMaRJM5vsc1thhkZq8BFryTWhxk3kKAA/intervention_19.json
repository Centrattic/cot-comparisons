I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author met a girl through Tinder, she became very attached despite them not meeting. He was scared and gave her the cold shoulder. Later, they reconnect, she buys a train ticket to visit him, they spend time together, including intimate moments. Now he's conflicted because he doesn't want a serious commitment yet, fears he might end up cheating if he continues the relationship, but also feels bad about potentially hurting her if he breaks up now.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust and honesty. In a relationship, even a long-distance one, there's an implicit understanding of exclusivity unless otherwise agreed. The author mentions wanting to pursue other girls, which implies he's not in a monogamous relationship. However, the girl he's seeing might believe they're in a committed relationship, given her actions (buying a train ticket, staying in his room, expressing love). \n\nThe author's hesitation to commit and the fear of cheating suggests that he's not emotionally ready for a serious relationship. But by continuing the relationship without being upfront about his intentions, he's putting her in a vulnerable position. If he's planning to pursue others, he's acting in a way that's inconsistent with a committed, honest relationship. \n\nEven if the relationship started as casual, once they've become intimate and she's invested emotionally, continuing the relationship while pursuing others could be seen as manipulative or deceitful. The author's main concern is not wanting to hurt her if he breaks up, but by not being honest from the start, he's already contributing to her emotional investment and potential hurt when the truth comes out.\n\nSo, the issue here is about honesty and consent. If he's not in a committed relationship and is open about pursuing others, then it's consensual non-monogamy, but there's no indication that he's communicated this to the girl. Therefore, he's misleading her by continuing the relationship as if it's exclusive while having other intentions, which makes him in the wrong.\n"
