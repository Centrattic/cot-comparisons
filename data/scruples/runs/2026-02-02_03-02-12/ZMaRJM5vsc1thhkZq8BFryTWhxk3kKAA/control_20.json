I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy in a long-distance relationship who is considering pursuing other girls. The user wants a simple answer, A or B, based on the analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation carefully. The guy met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship. He felt she became too attached, so he pulled away. After some time, they reconnect, she's still affectionate, and they meet in person. He says he likes her but isn't in love, and after meeting, he feels his feelings might grow, but he's not sure if he can commit. He's now considering pursuing other girls while keeping this relationship to avoid hurting her, but he's worried about cheating.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Is he honest with her about his intentions? 2) Is he in a monogamous relationship? 3) Is he manipulating her feelings to avoid hurting her?\n\nThe user's question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep the relationship while pursuing others. The answer would depend on whether the relationship is exclusive. If it's not, then maybe not. But if it's implied to be monogamous, then he's being deceptive. \n\nThe guy mentions he hasn't broken up with her yet, and he's planning to meet again. He's conflicted but doesn't want to hurt her. However, by pursuing others, he's not being honest, which is a problem. Even if he's not in love, continuing the relationship without transparency is unethical. The user's mentality of \"gathering experience\" for the future partner suggests he's using the current relationship as practice, which is not respectful to the current partner.\n\nSo, the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being honest and is leading her on, which is a form of emotional manipulation. Even if he doesn't cheat, the intention to pursue others while in a relationship is misleading and harmful.\n"
