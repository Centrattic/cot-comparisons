I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship, and the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The guy and the girl met online, had a connection, and then there was a period where he distanced himself. Then they reconnected, met up, and things got intimate. He's now worried about his growing feelings and the pressure, so he's thinking about pursuing others to gain experience before committing. But he doesn't want to cheat. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep her while seeing others.\n\nKey points: The relationship's status isn't entirely clear. They met, had a romantic encounter, and he's keeping her in his room. He hasn't explicitly defined the relationship. If it's a committed relationship, then pursuing others would be cheating. But if it's casual or not officially defined, maybe it's different. However, the girl expressed love, which implies some level of commitment. The author didn't reciprocate the love but still continued the relationship. \n\nAnother angle: The author is using the relationship to gain experience for future relationships, which might be using her. Also, by keeping the relationship going while seeking others, he's not being honest, which could be manipulative. Even if he's not physically cheating, emotionally he might be if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive. \n\nThe author mentions he doesn't want to break up with her because it would hurt her, but he's not ready for commitment. That's putting her in a position where she's invested emotionally, and he's not reciprocating fully. It's a form of emotional manipulation. \n\nSo, if the relationship is exclusive (even if not formally agreed), then pursuing others is wrong. If it's not exclusive, maybe not. But given the girl's feelings and actions (expressing love, buying a ticket to visit), it's likely she expects exclusivity. The author hasn't clarified this, so his actions could be deceitful. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for pursuing others is to prepare for a future relationship, which is selfish. It's using her for experience without considering her feelings. The fact that he's keeping her in his room and maintaining the relationship while seeking others shows a lack of honesty and respect. \n\nIn most ethical standards, being in a relationship (even if not officially labeled) and pursuing others without consent is wrong. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
