I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the author is considering pursuing other romantic interests while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The key points here are the existing relationship and the author's intentions. The author mentions that they are in a long-distance relationship, which can be challenging due to the physical separation. The woman in the relationship has expressed love for the author, and he hasn't reciprocated but hasn't ended the relationship either. He's now thinking about pursuing other relationships, which could be considered cheating if the current relationship is monogamous.\n\nI should check the definitions here. Cheating typically involves engaging in romantic or sexual activities with someone else while in a committed relationship without the consent of the partner. The author hasn't explicitly stated whether the current relationship is monogamous. If it's an open relationship, then pursuing others might be acceptable. However, if it's not, then the author is being dishonest by not addressing this with their partner.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author feels pressure from the woman's affection and the fear of hurting her if they break up. They want to enjoy the relationship without committing long-term, which might indicate a lack of commitment. This could be seen as inconsiderate if the woman believes the relationship is exclusive.\n\nThe author's reasoning about gaining experience to find their \"soulmate\" is a common justification but doesn't excuse potential deceit. If the current relationship is exclusive, then pursuing others without disclosure is cheating. The author hasn't communicated their intentions to the woman, which is a problem. Honesty is crucial in relationships, and withholding such intentions can lead to emotional harm.\n\nAdditionally, the author is in a position where they've already formed a close bond with this woman, leading to a physical relationship. Continuing this while seeing others could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if the relationship isn't formal. The fact that they're using the long-distance aspect as a reason to delay decisions doesn't change the ethical implications if they're not upfront with their partner.\n\nIn summary, the key issues are the exclusivity of the current relationship, the author's honesty with their partner, and the potential for emotional harm. If the relationship is monogamous and the author is seeing others without consent, that's in the wrong. If it's open, then it's a different scenario. But since the author hasn't clarified with the woman, they might be assuming an open dynamic that doesn't exist. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they're not being honest about their intentions and are possibly engaging in deceitful behavior.\n"
