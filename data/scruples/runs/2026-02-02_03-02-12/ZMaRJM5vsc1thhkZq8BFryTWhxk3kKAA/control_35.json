I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The situation is that the author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. He's been with her for a year, they met in person, and things were great. But he's now worried about his growing feelings and doesn't want to commit, so he's thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" He's conflicted because he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up but feels he might cheat if he continues the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is in a long-distance relationship, which can be challenging. He's not committed to a monogamous relationship and is considering pursuing others. The question is whether this makes him the asshole (AITA). \n\nLong-distance relationships often require a lot of emotional investment and trust. If the author is in a relationship where both parties expect exclusivity, then pursuing others would be a breach of that trust. However, the original setup of the relationship is unclear. Did he and the girl clarify the terms from the start? If the relationship was casual and non-exclusive, then maybe it's different. But if it was implied to be a serious or monogamous relationship, then pursuing others would be wrong.\n\nThe author mentions that the girl is very affectionate and said she loves him. He didn't reciprocate the love but explained why. She seemed content. However, after meeting in person, their intimacy increased, and he's now considering pursuing others. The problem here is that he's not being honest about his intentions. If he's not willing to be in a committed, monogamous relationship, he's leading her on. She might believe they are in a serious relationship, and he's not upfront about his desire to be with other people. That's a form of emotional manipulation or deceit, which could be considered wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\" This mindset is problematic because it treats the current relationship as a stepping stone rather than valuing the current partner. It's using her for experience, which is disrespectful. The girl is being led to believe that the relationship has potential, but he's holding back and planning to move on, which is unfair to her.\n\nEven if the author plans to break up eventually after some time, the fact that he's already considering other relationships while in this one is a problem. It's not just about the action of pursuing others but also about the dishonesty involved. If the relationship was supposed to be exclusive, he's violating that trust. If it wasn't, then maybe it's a different scenario, but the way he describes it (she bought a ticket, stayed in his room, etc.) suggests a level of commitment that implies exclusivity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he's being dishonest about his intentions and is leading the girl on while planning to pursue others. This is a breach of trust and emotional manipulation. So the answer should be A (Yes).\n"
