I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the author started a relationship with a girl via Tinder, then became distant because he didn't feel the same way she did. But when she came around again, he reconnected, and they ended up meeting and having a good time. Now, he's conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he also wants to keep seeing other people for experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" He's worried about cheating if he doesn't end the relationship but also doesn't want to hurt her if he does.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and commitment. The author and the girl are in a long-distance situation, which can be challenging. However, the author mentions he hasn't committed to a monogamous relationship and is still seeing other people. That's a big red flag because if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others is deceitful. But if it's non-exclusive from the start, then it's a different scenario. The problem is, the author's intentions and the terms of the relationship aren't clear. \n\nAlso, when the girl said she loves him, he didn't reciprocate. That could imply that the relationship was never fully committed, but if he's leading her on under the pretense of exclusivity, that's manipulative. The author might not be in the wrong if both parties are aware and agree to a non-monogamous arrangement. But if he's hiding the fact that he's seeing others, then he's being dishonest, which places him in the wrong. \n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally frowned upon, but the situation's details matter. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then it's his choice, but if it is, then he's violating trust. Since the author hasn't disclosed his intentions of seeing others to the girl, he's being deceptive, making him the asshole.\n"
