I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy and the girl started a relationship through Tinder, had a long-distance setup, met up, had a great time, and she's in love with him. He's not ready to commit fully and is worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to hurt her if he breaks up. He also mentions his belief that he should get experience to prepare for a future relationship, which leads him to consider pursuing other girls without cheating.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship with one person while considering or pursuing others. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. In a typical monogamous relationship, pursuing others would be considered cheating, which is generally frowned upon. However, the author hasn't explicitly stated that the relationship is monogamous. But in most cases, relationships are assumed to be monogamous unless otherwise discussed.\n\nThe author hasn't cheated yet but is planning to pursue others, which could be emotionally harmful if the relationship isn't open. The girl is very attached and in love, while he's not ready to commit. The author is also aware that breaking up would hurt her, which complicates things because he's maintaining a relationship he might not be serious about.\n\nAnother angle is the communication aspect. If he hasn't discussed his intentions to pursue others with her, then he's being dishonest. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe it's not cheating, but the problem arises if there's an unspoken expectation of monogamy.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for a future \"one,\" which is a bit self-serving and could be seen as using the girl. The girl's feelings are valid, and his actions might lead to emotional harm. So, ethically, is it wrong? If he's not being honest about his intentions and the relationship isn't open, then yes, he's in the wrong. However, if he and the girl have discussed non-monogamy and are both okay with it, then maybe not. But since there's no mention of that, it's likely he's in a monogamous relationship without his knowledge or agreement.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because he's considering pursuing others without her knowledge or consent, which breaches trust and can cause emotional harm. The answer should be A (Yes).\n"
