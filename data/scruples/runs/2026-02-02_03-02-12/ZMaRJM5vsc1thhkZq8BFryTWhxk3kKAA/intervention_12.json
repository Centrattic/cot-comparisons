I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 22, in a long-distance relationship that started online. They didn't feel reciprocated the initial affection and then gave her the cold shoulder. Now, after reconnecting, they met in person, had a great time, and she said she loves him. He didn't return the love but explained why. They plan to meet again, but he's worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to commit. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls so he's ready for \"the one,\" but doesn't want to cheat.\n\nSo the main issue is whether he's in the wrong for being in a relationship while considering pursuing others. The key points here are honesty and commitment. In most relationships, exclusivity is expected unless otherwise agreed. If the author is pursuing other girls, that's a breach of trust. Even if he isn't cheating yet, the intention to do so could be problematic. Also, he's concerned about hurting her if he breaks up, but he's not transparent about his intentions. It's important to consider if the relationship was ever exclusive or if there was an understanding about future plans. If not, then he's being deceptive. The author's reasoning is that he's not ready for a serious relationship and wants to gain experience, but that doesn't justify leading someone on. The answer would likely be that he is in the wrong because he's not being honest and is planning to engage in behavior that the relationship doesn't allow.\n"
