I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while staying in the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy and the girl started talking over Tinder, she became very attached early on, which made him uncomfortable. He pulled back, but after some time, they reconnected. She expressed love, he didn't reciprocate but explained why. They met in person, had a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted because he doesn't want to commit fully and is thinking about seeing other people. His main concern is not wanting to hurt her if he breaks up, but he also doesn't want to end the relationship. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep the relationship while pursuing others.\n\nNow, considering ethical and relational standards. In a committed relationship, being with someone else is typically considered cheating or at least dishonest. But here, the relationship seems to be unspoken or not fully defined. The guy hasn't committed to a monogamous relationship, and the girl might not have expected exclusivity. However, he's using the relationship as a way to gain experience before a future \"real\" relationship. \n\nThe key issue is whether both parties are on the same page about exclusivity. If the guy is not in a monogamous relationship and hasn't communicated his intentions of pursuing others, he's being disingenuous. The girl, on the other hand, might be expecting some level of commitment given the emotional and physical intimacy, especially after her declaration of love. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, but he's prolonging the situation, which could lead to more hurt if she's not aware of his intentions. Even if he's not in a formal relationship, the emotional investment from her side suggests that she might see this as a meaningful relationship. His actions could be seen as taking advantage of her feelings while maintaining his own freedom, which is ethically questionable. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of emotional honesty. If he's not willing to be exclusive, he should communicate that clearly from the start. However, he didn't do that, leading her to believe there's a possibility of a future with him. This could be considered misleading. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy's actions, while perhaps not illegal, are morally ambiguous. He's keeping the girl in a state of uncertainty, which isn't fair to her. The answer hinges on whether he's being transparent about his intentions. Since he hasn't communicated his plan to pursue others, he's in the wrong because he's not being honest about the nature of their relationship.\n"
