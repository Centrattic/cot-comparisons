I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they have a long-distance relationship with a girl they met on Tinder. They didn't feel the same level of affection as she did initially, and they started to give her the cold shoulder because they were scared she'd fall in love with them. Now, after reconnecting and spending time together, the author is conflicted because their feelings have grown, but they still want to pursue other girls to gain experience before committing to \"the one.\" They don't want to hurt her by breaking up now and think time might help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance. If they're planning to pursue other girls while still being in a relationship, that's typically considered cheating or at least being in a polyamorous situation without the other person's consent. The key point here is whether the author is being honest and open with the girl about their intentions. The question is if they're in the wrong by keeping the relationship while pursuing others. \n\nThe author mentions they haven't said they love her back and have been hesitant because of fear. But after meeting, their feelings grew, and they still don't want to commit fully. The problem is that if they're not committed and are actively looking for others, that could be leading the girl on. They also mention they don't want to break up because it would hurt her, but they're not sure if they can maintain the relationship long-term. \n\nIn most relationships, especially when there's physical intimacy and time spent together, exclusivity is expected. If the author is not willing to commit and is pursuing others, they're not being truthful, which can be hurtful. Even if they don't cheat, the intent to pursue others while in a relationship is often seen as dishonest and manipulative, whether it's a physical relationship or not. The author's reasoning is that they want experience to avoid messing up a future serious relationship, but that's using the current relationship as a stepping stone, which isn't fair to the girl. \n\nAlso, the girl's affection and the time they've invested into the relationship (buying a train ticket, staying in the author's room) show she's serious. The author's hesitation to commit and their plan to explore other relationships might be leading her on without her knowledge. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're not being honest about their intentions, even if they don't act on them immediately. The relationship might not be exclusive, but the author's actions suggest they're not committed to a monogamous or even a serious relationship. That's not fair to the girl who has invested emotionally and physically into the relationship.\n"
