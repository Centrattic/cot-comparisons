I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They never met until recently when she visited him. Now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's afraid of getting too attached. He also mentions wanting to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future relationship. The question is whether he's being dishonest or unfair by keeping her while seeing others.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the author hasn't explicitly defined the relationship's boundaries. The girl said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate but explained why. They're planning meetups, and he's considering breaking up to avoid future hurt. However, he's also thinking about pursuing other girls. \n\nWait, the problem is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep her while seeing others. If the relationship is monogamous but not officially defined, and he's not honest about his intentions, that's an issue. The girl might think it's exclusive, especially after saying \"I love you,\" which implies a deeper commitment. The author's plan to pursue others while maintaining the relationship could be seen as deceptive because it's not transparent. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's not sure if she's his future partner but wants to keep her for now. That sounds like he's leading her on without clear communication. If he's not committed and is planning to be with others, he's not being honest with her. Even if he hasn't cheated yet, the intent to pursue others while in a relationship where she's emotionally invested would make him unethical in this scenario.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using the relationship as a way to gain experience without committing, which can be harmful. He's aware of the potential for cheating but is avoiding that by not committing. However, by not being upfront, he's creating a situation where the girl is put in a vulnerable position. \n\nSo, based on standard ethical relationship norms, being in a relationship where one person isn't committed and is pursuing others without disclosure is typically considered wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
