I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl online, and she became very attached. He felt scared and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, she reached out again, they reconnected, she fell in love, but he didn't reciprocate. They met up, had a good time, and now he's feeling conflicted. He's enjoying the relationship but fears he might want to pursue others if he doesn't break up with her. He doesn't want to hurt her, but he's also not sure if he can commit.\n\nSo, the core issue here is whether keeping the relationship while seeking others is unethical. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe it's okay. But if it's implied or expected to be monogamous, then pursuing others would be a problem. The author hasn't mentioned discussing exclusivity with the girl. She bought a train ticket to visit him, which suggests she's invested. He's also not sure if he's in love and wants to gain experience before settling down. \n\nThe key points are consent and communication. If the girl believes the relationship is exclusive and he's pursuing others without her knowledge, that's definitely wrong. The author hasn't clarified the relationship's boundaries, so he might be leading her on. Even if he doesn't cheat, his intention to pursue others while maintaining the relationship could be emotionally manipulative. He's also aware that breaking up might hurt her, but keeping her in a state of uncertainty is also harmful. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. If he's not ready for commitment and isn't upfront about it, he's in the wrong. The fact that he's planning to pursue other girls while being in a relationship with her suggests he's not being transparent. Even if he doesn't physically cheat, emotionally cheating by maintaining a relationship with the intent to be with others is unethical. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is likely leading her on without clear communication about exclusivity.\n"
