I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author met a girl on Tinder, she became very attached, but he wasn't into it at first. Then, after some time, they reconnected, she fell in love, and he went to see her. Now he's feeling conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he also doesn't want a long-term commitment. He's considering breaking up but doesn't want to hurt her, and he's also thinking about pursuing other girls without cheating.\n\nThe main ethical points here are about honesty and emotional responsibility. The author is in a long-distance relationship where the other person has expressed love. If he continues to maintain that relationship while also being interested in others, that could be considered emotionally manipulative or deceitful. The key issue is whether he's being transparent with her about his intentions.\n\nHe mentions not wanting to commit but still engaging in a relationship where she's emotionally invested. That's a classic scenario where one person is leading the other on. Even if he doesn't cheat, keeping her in a state of uncertainty without commitment can be harmful. The idea of \"pursuing other girls\" while in a relationship might imply that he's not being exclusive, which is cheating. If he's in a relationship, even a long-distance one, he's supposed to be faithful. If he's not, then he's in the wrong.\n\nAdditionally, he's using her affection as a way to avoid commitment, which isn't fair to her. The fact that he's thinking about how to break up without hurting her suggests he knows it's not right but is hesitating because of his own convenience. The ethical responsibility here is to be honest about his intentions from the start. If he can't commit and doesn't want to be exclusive, he should have communicated that earlier to avoid leading her on.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's maintaining a relationship under false pretenses and planning to pursue others without committing to her. That's not fair and can cause emotional harm. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
