I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this long post is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship and is also considering pursuing other girls. He's worried about his feelings growing and not wanting to commit, but he doesn't want to hurt his current partner either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The author and his partner have been in a long-distance relationship for a while. They met in person, had a great time, and she's very affectionate. He's feeling pressured because he doesn't see her as a long-term partner but still wants to keep things going. He also wants to date others to gain experience for his \"future soulmate,\" but he's afraid of cheating if he continues with this current relationship. \n\nNow, the main issue is whether he's being dishonest or manipulative. If he's in a relationship, even a long-distance one, and is considering or already pursuing others, that's typically considered cheating unless both parties are aware and okay with it. The author mentions he hasn't told her about his plans to pursue others. He's also not sure if he can commit and is using the relationship as a way to gain experience for a future partner. \n\nThe question is about whether he's the asshole. If he's not being honest with her about his intentions to be with other people, then that's a problem. Even if they're in a long-distance and not exclusive, the assumption might be that they are monogamous. By pursuing others without her knowledge, he's violating trust and potentially leading her on if he's not going to commit. \n\nHe also mentions that he doesn't want to break up with her because it would hurt her, but he's not being upfront about his own needs and desires. That lack of communication could be seen as selfish, as he's prioritizing his own experience over her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and mutual expectations are crucial. If he's not going to be monogamous, he should have that conversation with her. Since he hasn't and is planning to pursue others while in a relationship, that seems like a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
