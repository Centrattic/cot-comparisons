I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author met a girl online, and she became very attached. He was scared and gave her the cold shoulder. Later, after some time, they reconnect, and she ends up staying with him. They have a good time, and she's affectionate. He's now worried about his feelings growing and the pressure it's causing. He wants to keep her around but also wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for his \"future soulmate.\"\n\nThe key points here are: the author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance, and he's considering seeing other people. In most relationships, even if they're not exclusive, being in a committed relationship and pursuing others can be seen as a betrayal. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that he never said he's in a committed relationship. He said he didn't say he loves her back and they were planning to meet. However, the fact that they had a long-distance relationship, met up, shared intimate moments, and she's very attached might imply some level of exclusivity even if it's not formally stated.\n\nIf the author isn't in a committed monogamous relationship, then pursuing others might not be wrong. But if there's an understanding of exclusivity, then he is in the wrong. The user says she bought a train ticket and stayed in his room. That sounds like a significant level of commitment and trust. If he's going to pursue others while in that situation, even if it's not explicitly a monogamous relationship, it's likely that she expects some level of exclusivity. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he wants experience for his future soulmate. That's a bit of a selfish motive. If he's leading her on knowing that he's not fully committed and is going to look elsewhere, that's hurtful. Even if he doesn't cheat currently, the intention to pursue others while in a close relationship is problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's emotionally involved with someone, leading them to believe there's a level of exclusivity, while planning to pursue others. Even if the relationship isn't explicitly defined, the actions suggest a level of commitment that he's not honoring. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
