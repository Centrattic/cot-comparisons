I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy met a girl online, they developed a relationship over time, had a meet-up, and she's very attached. He feels she's not his future partner and is worried about getting too deep. He's considering breaking up but doesn't want to hurt her. Meanwhile, he's thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience before his \"one.\"\n\nSo, key points: The relationship is long-distance, he's not committed to a future with her, and he's considering seeing others. The main ethical issue here is whether he's being honest and respectful to the current partner. \n\nHe hasn't explicitly mentioned being in a monogamous relationship. But if he's in a relationship with her and also pursuing others, that's typically considered cheating. However, if they're not exclusive or monogamous, maybe it's okay. The post doesn't clarify if they've set boundaries. \n\nHe mentions she's staying in his room, they had sex, and she loves him. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be wrong. But if it's open, then maybe not. But the default assumption in relationships is usually monogamy unless stated otherwise. \n\nHe's also in a situation where he's leading her on, making her feel loved but not committing. That could be emotionally manipulative. The problem is his fear of commitment and not being honest about his intentions. If he's not ready for a future with her but is keeping her in a relationship, that's a red flag.\n\nThe user's answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). Based on the analysis, if the relationship is monogamous, he's being unfaithful. If it's not, maybe not. But the key issue is his lack of honesty and potential emotional harm to her by not clarifying boundaries. So, he's likely in the wrong for not being upfront and possibly leading her on while pursuing others.\n"
