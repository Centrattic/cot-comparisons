I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy who had a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They never met in person for the first two months, and she became very attached, which made him scared. He then gave her the cold shoulder. After some time, she still reached out, and they reconnected. She told him she loves him, he didn't say it back, but they met in person. They had a good time, including intimacy, and now he's concerned about his growing feelings and the pressure to not want to break up with her. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls to prepare for his future relationship, so he's considering pursuing others while keeping this one. The key question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, let's consider the basics of relationships. If the author is in a committed relationship, even if it's long-distance, then pursuing other people would be considered cheating, which is wrong. But in this case, the relationship isn't entirely clear. The initial interaction was over Tinder, they never met until later, and the author didn't commit to a monogamous relationship. However, after meeting and spending time together, especially in his home, it's possible that the relationship was considered exclusive. The author didn't clarify boundaries, which is a problem.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not ready for a serious commitment and wants to prepare for his future by gaining experience. But this is a common way people justify their actions without taking responsibility. The issue here is whether both parties agreed to a non-exclusive relationship. If the girl believed they were in a monogamous relationship, then the author is in the wrong by pursuing others. Since he's planning to break up with her later because he doesn't see a future, but doesn't want to hurt her now, he's keeping her in a situation where he's not emotionally committed. That's manipulative and unfair to her. She expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate, yet he continued the relationship. That shows a lack of honesty and respect for her feelings.\n\nAdditionally, after meeting and sharing intimate moments, it's reasonable for her to expect exclusivity. If the author is going to pursue other people, he should have communicated that from the start. His actions now are misleading her. Even if he doesn't want to break up, he's not being truthful about his intentions, which is a form of emotional manipulation. So, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest and is leading her on without clear boundaries.\n"
