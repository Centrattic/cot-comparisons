I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl on Tinder, and she became very attached even though they hadn't met. He backed off because he was scared. Then, after some time, they reconnected, met in person, and things were great. Now he's worried about his growing feelings and not wanting to commit fully. He mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls for his future \"real\" relationship. \n\nThe key points here are: Is he in a committed relationship? The original post says she bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, had sex, and he's planning to see her again. But does he have a label on their relationship? The author says he didn't say he loves her, but they were planning to meet again. The question is about whether it's wrong to pursue others while in a long-distance relationship. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing others would be cheating. But if it's not exclusive, maybe it's not. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not ready for commitment and wants to explore, but he doesn't want to hurt her. However, by continuing the relationship while also seeing others, he might be leading her on. The problem is that if he's not clear about exclusivity, she might think it's a committed relationship, and he's being dishonest. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the relationship is exclusive. If it's not, then maybe he's not wrong. But if he's led her to believe it's exclusive, then pursuing others would be wrong. The author didn't mention discussing the relationship's status. He also didn't break up with her, so she might think they're still together. Therefore, by continuing to be with her while seeing others, he's being deceptive. \n\nIn most relationships, even long-distance, exclusivity is implied unless stated otherwise. So, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is likely leading her on. The answer should be A.\n"
