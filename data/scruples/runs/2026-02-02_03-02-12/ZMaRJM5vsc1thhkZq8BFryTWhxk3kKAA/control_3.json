I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the relationship. \n\nFirst, the guy met a girl on Tinder, they talked for two months, she became attached, but he was scared and pulled back. Then after some time, they reconnected, had a meet-up, and now he's feeling conflicted. He's worried about his growing feelings but also wants to keep her for fun while pursuing others. His reasoning is that he wants experience before finding his \"one.\"\n\nSo, the key points here: Is it okay to be in a relationship with someone while pursuing others? The author hasn't explicitly defined the relationship's boundaries. The girl said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate, but they've been intimate and made plans. If the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. But if it's open or casual, maybe not. However, the author hasn't communicated this clearly. \n\nThe author's intention to not want to hurt her by breaking up now suggests he's aware of the potential harm. By continuing the relationship while seeking others, he might be leading her on. The girl's affection and the fact that she's fun don't negate the ethical issue here. If the author is considering pursuing others, that's a red flag for the girl if she expects exclusivity. \n\nThe author's mindset about needing experience before the \"one\" is a bit of an excuse. It's not a valid reason to be in a relationship while dating others unless both parties agree. Without clear communication, this is likely cheating or at least emotionally dishonest. So, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being transparent and is using the girl without considering her feelings or the relationship's boundaries."
