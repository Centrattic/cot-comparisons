I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 22, met a girl on Tinder, they had a long-distance relationship. He felt scared of her attachment, gave her the cold shoulder, then after some time, they reconnected. She confessed her love, he didn't reciprocate but explained why. They met up, had a good time, and now he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls so he doesn't \"mess it up\" with his future partner.\n\nNow, the key points here are about emotional honesty and commitment. The author is in a relationship with this girl, even if it's long-distance. If he's also pursuing other girls, that's a problem if the relationship is exclusive. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe user says \"pursue other girls,\" which could mean he's actively dating others or just looking. If the relationship isn't exclusive, maybe it's not wrong. But typically, a long-distance relationship assumes some level of exclusivity. The author didn't mention discussing boundaries with the girl. So, if he's pursuing others without her knowledge, that's deceitful. Also, he's worried about his feelings growing, but his actions might already be causing emotional harm. \n\nAnother angle: the author is using the girl for experience, not considering her feelings, which is selfish. The girl is into him and might believe they're in a committed relationship. The author's plan to \"gain experience\" implies he's not fully committed, yet he's maintaining a close relationship. That could be seen as emotionally manipulative. \n\nHe's also conflicted about breaking up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her. But by not being honest about his intentions, he's already setting her up for potential heartbreak. The author's fear of cheating later might not justify his current behavior. It's better to be honest from the start. \n\nSo, putting it all together: If the author is in a relationship with this girl (even long-distance) and is pursuing others without her knowledge, that's a breach of trust and emotional integrity. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
