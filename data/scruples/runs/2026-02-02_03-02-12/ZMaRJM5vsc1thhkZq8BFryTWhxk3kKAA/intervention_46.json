I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The key points here are the relationship status, communication, and intentions.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl on Tinder, they had a long-distance relationship, met in person, had intimate moments, and now he's conflicted about his feelings and the possibility of being with other women. He mentions he doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he continues this relationship. The main issue here is whether he's being honest with his partner and if his actions are respectful.\n\nLooking at the details: He initially gave her a cold shoulder because he feared her attachment. Then, after reconnecting, she expressed love, but he couldn't reciprocate. They planned a visit, shared time, and now he's feeling conflicted. The problem arises from him wanting to pursue others while in a relationship. Even if it's not physically cheating, emotionally pursuing others while in a committed (or even casual) relationship can be considered a breach of trust. The author hasn't explicitly mentioned discussing boundaries with his partner. If he's pursuing other women without her knowledge, that's a problem. However, if their relationship is open or non-monogamous, that's different. The post doesn't indicate that they've discussed such terms. \n\nThe author's justification is that he's trying to gain experience for a future relationship. However, this doesn't excuse potentially leading someone on or not being upfront. The girl expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate but continued the relationship. That could be seen as emotionally manipulative. The fact that he feels pressured by her affection and is considering ending things might be necessary, but the act of pursuing others during this time without clear communication is where the issue lies.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's in a relationship where exclusivity is expected and he's pursuing others without discussing it, then yes. The answer would be A. But if there's no exclusivity, maybe not. However, given the context\u2014she bought a train ticket, stayed in his room, and he's the one who's unsure about his feelings\u2014it's likely an implicit expectation of monogamy. Therefore, pursuing others would be wrong. So, Answer A.\n"
