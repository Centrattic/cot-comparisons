I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is 22, and the situation involves a girl he met on Tinder. They had a long-distance relationship, met up, and had a good time. Now he's feeling conflicted because he's developed feelings but doesn't want a long-term commitment. He also wants to date other girls to gain experience for his future \"one.\"\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and consent. The author hasn't explicitly stated whether the relationship is exclusive. If it's not, then pursuing others might be okay. But if it's an exclusive relationship, then pursuing others without consent would be a problem. The story mentions they were planning to meet, and he's using the house and room during her visit. However, he hasn't clarified expectations with her. \n\nThe author feels pressure because she's very affectionate and now loves him, but he's not ready to reciprocate the feelings. He's worried about hurting her if he breaks up now but doesn't want a long-term commitment. His reasoning is that he's trying to gain experience for a future relationship. \n\nThe ethical issue here is about honesty and boundaries. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous, then his intention to pursue others is a breach of trust. However, if there's no explicit agreement on exclusivity, then maybe it's not wrong. But the problem arises when one party is more invested than the other. The author might be leading her on, making her believe in a future that he isn't committed to. \n\nAlso, the fact that she bought a train ticket to visit him and he let her stay in his room could imply a level of commitment. His actions might be seen as manipulative, using her affection while planning to pursue others. Even if he doesn't intend to cheat, the intent to keep her while dating others could be deceitful. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is being honest about his intentions. If he's not upfront and is keeping her in a situation where she's investing emotionally while he's not, that's where the problem lies. The answer hinges on whether a mutual understanding of exclusivity exists. If not, then the author is in the wrong for not being transparent and potentially misleading her.\n"
