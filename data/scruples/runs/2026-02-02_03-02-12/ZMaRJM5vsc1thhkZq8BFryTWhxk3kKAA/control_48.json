I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the man is feeling conflicted about his feelings and considering pursuing other relationships while maintaining the current one.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man met a woman online, they had a long-distance relationship, met up, and she expressed love for him. He hasn't reciprocated and is worried about his feelings growing further. He also mentions wanting to gain experience with other women to prepare for a future \"soulmate\" but doesn't want to cheat. The central issue is whether he's being dishonest or manipulative by not being upfront about his intentions and possibly leading her on.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, honesty and mutual expectations are crucial. If the woman believes they are in a monogamous relationship and the man is considering pursuing others, that's a breach of trust. Even if they aren't formally in a relationship, his actions and the intimacy they've shared might imply certain boundaries. The fact that he hasn't communicated his intention to pursue others suggests he's keeping this a secret, which is a red flag. \n\nAlso, the man is using the woman's affection and investment in the relationship while hesitating to commit, which can be seen as emotionally manipulative. The woman's well-being is a concern here; if he continues without clear communication, it could lead to her heartbreak. The idea of \"gaining experience\" for a future relationship also implies that he's not treating this relationship with the seriousness it might deserve.\n\nHowever, some might argue that they aren't in an official relationship, so his actions aren't necessarily cheating. But given the level of intimacy and his own feelings, it's reasonable to expect that he should be transparent about his intentions. The fact that he's planning to break up later without addressing the issue upfront could hurt her more in the long run.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the man is being dishonest about his intentions and is leading her on, which makes him the asshole. The answer is A.\n"
