I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship and also pursue other girls. The situation is that he's been in a long-distance relationship where they have met, had intimate moments, and she's very attached. He feels his feelings are growing, but he's also hesitant about committing and wants to get more experience with other girls before finding \"the one.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of relationships. If he's in a committed relationship, then pursuing others would typically be considered cheating or at least unethical, depending on what was agreed upon. However, the key here is whether the relationship was exclusive. The author didn't mention discussing exclusivity. The woman he's with seems to be very affectionate and has bought a train ticket to visit him, which suggests a level of commitment. But since they haven't met before, maybe there's ambiguity.\n\nHe mentions that he hasn't said he loves her back, but they have a planned meeting and are spending time together. The problem arises from his intention to pursue other girls while maintaining this relationship. If they're in a monogamous relationship, then he's in the wrong. But if it's an open or non-exclusive arrangement, maybe not. However, the user didn't specify that. Typically, unless stated otherwise, a relationship is assumed to be exclusive. \n\nHe's also concerned about hurting her if he breaks up, but he doesn't want to. The fact that he's planning to break up later but not now might mean he's in a situation where he's leading her on. If he's not committed to being exclusive, but is acting as if he is, that's deceitful. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants experience before settling down. While that's his personal choice, if he's engaging in a relationship without being honest about his intentions, that's where the problem lies. The woman might believe she's in an exclusive, committed relationship, while he's planning to see others. That's a breach of trust and would generally be considered unethical. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's maintaining a relationship with the knowledge that he's not being exclusive, which can lead to emotional harm. Even if there's no explicit commitment, the actions and plans made (like meeting, intimate moments) suggest a level of exclusivity he's not honoring.\n"
