I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while staying with his current partner. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The guy started a relationship through Tinder, they had a lot of communication, then he pulled back because he was scared. Later, they reconnect, she moves to visit him, they become closer, and now he's conflicted about his growing feelings and his desire to explore other relationships. He doesn't want to cheat but fears he might if he continues this way.\n\nThe main issue here is honesty and commitment. If they're in a relationship, even a long-distance one, pursuing others without disclosure is typically considered cheating. The guy mentions wanting to \"get as much experience as possible\" before finding his \"one,\" which implies he's not fully committed to this relationship. That could be seen as a lack of honesty and potentially leading the girl on if he's not clear about his intentions.\n\nAlso, the girl expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate but said he was content. Now, if he's considering moving on or seeing others without a clear conversation about his feelings, that's unfair to her. She might be invested more than he is, and that's where the hurt could come from. The fact that he's keeping her in his life but not being transparent about his plans to pursue others could be seen as misleading.\n\nOn the other hand, he's young, exploring, and not wanting to commit yet. But in most relationships, exclusivity is expected if it's mutual. If there was no prior agreement about exclusivity, maybe it's not cheating, but ethically, it's still questionable because he's leading her on. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, but that's not a valid excuse for not being honest. The right thing would be to communicate his intentions clearly, even if it's painful.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because he's being dishonest and leading the girl on without clear boundaries. Even if there's no formal commitment, the way he's handling the situation is misleading and could hurt her. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
