I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the author met a girl online, they talked a lot, she became attached. He pulled away because he didn't feel the same. Then months later, they reconnect, she says she loves him, they meet, spend time together, have a good time. Now he's conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he doesn't want a long-term commitment. He also wants to date other girls to gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep the relationship while pursuing others.\n\nSo, key points: The author and the girl are in a LDR. The author hasn't set clear boundaries. He's considering pursuing other relationships, which could be cheating if the LDR is monogamous. The girl is very attached and might not be aware of his intentions. The author feels pressure to not break up because he doesn't want to hurt her, but he's not sure if the relationship is right for him long-term. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, if the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others is cheating, which is wrong. But the problem is, the author hasn't communicated his intentions. The initial relationship might not have been clearly defined. He mentioned she bought a train ticket, stayed in his room, had sex. So it's a serious relationship. If he's not committed to exclusivity, he should have said so from the start. Now, he's in a position where he's leading her on, which is unethical. Even if he plans to break up later, keeping her in the dark about his intentions is wrong. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
