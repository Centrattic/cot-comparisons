I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author met a girl on Tinder, they talked a lot online. She became attached, and he felt uncomfortable. He pushed her away but later reconnected when she was single again. They met, had a good time, and she expressed love, but he didn't reciprocate. Now, he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure, so he's thinking about pursuing other relationships to gain experience before settling down. However, he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamics of their relationship. The author didn't initially reciprocate her feelings, then reconnected after she was single. They had a physical and emotional connection, but he's not ready to commit. Now, he's considering other girls, which implies seeking multiple relationships. \n\nThe question is whether this is wrong. If the relationship is not exclusive, then maybe it's okay. But if he's leading her on by not being honest about his intentions, that's a problem. The author mentions he's not in love but enjoys her company. If he's not committed to exclusivity, he might be in the wrong for not being upfront. Also, pursuing other girls while in a relationship, even if it's not a formal one, could be seen as dishonest or manipulative. \n\nThe problem is the lack of clarity. If he's not in a committed relationship and is honest with her about his intentions to pursue others, then maybe it's his choice. But if he's giving her signals that he's exclusively interested in her while planning to pursue others, that's deceitful. The author's main issue is his own indecision and fear of commitment, leading him to consider non-exclusive behavior. \n\nSince he's in a long-distance situation and hasn't clearly defined the relationship's boundaries, he might be the asshole for not being transparent. The fact that he's trying to avoid hurting her by not breaking up now but still plans to pursue others suggests he's using her for emotional support and experience, which isn't fair. So, the answer would be yes, he's in the wrong (A).\n"
