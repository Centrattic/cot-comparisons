I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The original post is a classic AITA question where the person is trying to balance their feelings and intentions.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl online, their relationship started long-distance, and there was a lot of emotional connection. He felt pressured when she expressed love and didn't reciprocate. They met up, had a good time, and now he's worried about growing feelings and possibly cheating by pursuing others.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship and also try to pursue others. In many relationships, exclusivity is a key component. If the author hasn't established that this is non-exclusive, then pursuing other girls would be considered cheating. The problem here is that the author hasn't explicitly talked about the relationship's boundaries. The girl he's with has shown strong attachment and even bought a train ticket to visit him. If he's not committed to exclusivity, that could be a problem.\n\nHe mentions he wants to get experience with different girls for his future. That's his reasoning, but in relationships, honesty and clear communication are important. If he's not upfront about his intentions to pursue others, then he's not being transparent, which can lead to hurt feelings. The girl put effort into the relationship, so if he's not committed to being monogamous, that's a betrayal of trust.\n\nAlso, the author hasn't broken up with her yet, even though he's aware it might not be a long-term future. By continuing the relationship without being honest about his intentions, he's keeping her in a potentially misleading situation. That's a classic AITA scenario where the person is unsure if they're causing harm.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is keeping the girl in a relationship where she's emotionally invested, while he's planning to pursue others. The right thing would be to have an open conversation about expectations or to end the relationship if exclusivity isn't possible.\n"
