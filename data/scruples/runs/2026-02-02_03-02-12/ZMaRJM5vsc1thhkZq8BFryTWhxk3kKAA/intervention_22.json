I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They never met for two months, and she became very attached. He felt uncomfortable and gave her the cold shoulder, then later reconnected. They met in person, had a good time, and she expressed love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They plan to meet again, but now he's worried about growing feelings and possibly wanting to pursue others.\n\nThe key points here are communication and honesty. The author mentions he's not in a committed relationship but is maintaining a LDR while seeing others. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe it's not cheating. But if there were unspoken expectations, that's where the problem lies. The author also says he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, but he's worried about future feelings. He's trying to gain experience for his future \"one.\" \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if the author's actions are manipulative or deceitful. If he's upfront with both parties and isn't leading anyone on, then it's not his fault. But if he's giving false impressions of exclusivity, that's where the issue is. The author hasn't explicitly stated whether he's told the girl he's seeing others. If he hasn't, then he's being dishonest. Also, pursuing other girls while in a relationship, even if not exclusive, can be seen as emotionally unavailable. \n\nBut since he's not in an official committed relationship, maybe it's his choice. However, the girl expressed love, and the author hasn't reciprocated. That could mean he's not fully committed either. The question is whether keeping her while pursuing others is wrong. If both parties are aware and okay with it, then no. But if the girl believes it's a monogamous relationship, the author is in the wrong. The description suggests he's not clear about terms, leading to potential emotional harm. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author might be in the wrong because he's not being transparent about his intentions and might be leading her on. He's using her for experience while expecting her to be emotionally invested. That's manipulative and not fair. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
