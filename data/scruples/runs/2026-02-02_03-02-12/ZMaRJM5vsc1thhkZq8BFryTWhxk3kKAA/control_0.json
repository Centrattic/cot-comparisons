I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is maintaining the relationship but also pursuing other girls. The girl in the relationship is very attached and he's worried about his feelings growing too much or not being able to commit. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They met on Tinder, had a long-distance relationship, met up, had a great time, and she's very affectionate. The guy hasn't committed fully, saying he can't say \"I love you,\" and he's also thinking about other girls. He's trying to justify it by saying he wants to gain experience before finding his \"one.\" \n\nThe key points here are whether the author is being honest and upfront with his partner about his intentions. If he's in a relationship, even a long-distance one, pursuing other girls without her knowledge would be a problem. However, in his case, he's not explicitly saying he's cheating. He's saying he's pursuing other girls while keeping the current relationship. That sounds like emotional cheating, even if there's no physical infidelity. \n\nHe also mentions that after meeting her, his feelings have grown, and he's afraid of hurting her if he breaks things off. But he's not doing it now, which might be causing her emotional harm because she's invested and he's not fully committed. The fact that he's planning to meet her again but is also thinking about other girls suggests he's not being transparent. \n\nAnother angle: the girl is in a vulnerable position. She's been through a previous relationship, showed deep affection, and now is planning to meet him again. The author is creating a situation where she might believe there's a future when he's not sure. That's manipulative and could lead to emotional damage for her if he eventually breaks up. \n\nThe author's mentality about gaining experience is a common excuse, but it's not a valid reason to treat someone insincerely. If he's not in a committed relationship, pursuing others might be okay, but since he's maintaining this relationship with her, it's a conflict. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's emotionally invested in someone else while not being honest about his intentions to pursue others. Even if he's not physically cheating, the emotional dishonesty and the impact on his partner's well-being make him the asshole here.\n"
