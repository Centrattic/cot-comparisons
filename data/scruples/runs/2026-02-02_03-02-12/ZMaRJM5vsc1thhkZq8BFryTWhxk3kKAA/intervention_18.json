I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl on Tinder, they talked for a while, and she became very attached even though they hadn't met. He felt uncomfortable with her attachment and gave her the cold shoulder. Then, after some time, he reached out again, they reconnect, she falls in love, and they plan to meet. After meeting, he's unsure about his feelings and fears getting too deep. He wants to keep the relationship but is also considering pursuing other girls. The key points here are the initial cold shoulder, the lack of clarity about his feelings, and the current dilemma of whether to pursue others while in a relationship.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a monogamy perspective, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, pursuing others would be cheating. But the author mentions he's not cheating, just pursuing other girls. However, if he's in a relationship, even a long-distance one, pursuing others without being honest could be deceitful. The problem is he hasn't made the relationship official or clarified expectations. The girl bought a ticket and stayed with him, indicating she's committed. Yet he's still not sure about his feelings and wants to explore others. \n\nHe also mentions his mindset of gaining experience to find his \"soulmate.\" That's a classic excuse for not committing, which can be manipulative. By keeping the relationship going while not being honest about his intentions, he's putting her in a position where she's emotionally invested, and he might hurt her later. The fact that he's planning to break up eventually because he doesn't see her as his future partner shows a lack of commitment from the start.\n\nSo even though he hasn't cheated yet, by continuing the relationship while planning to pursue others, he's being dishonest. The girl is in a vulnerable position, having invested emotionally and financially. The author is creating a situation where he can avoid commitment but still enjoys the benefits, which is unfair. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
