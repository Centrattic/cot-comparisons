I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for a year, met up, had a good time, and she's into him. But he's feeling conflicted because he doesn't think she's his future soulmate. He also wants to keep gaining experience with other girls to avoid messing up with the \"right\" one. He's worried about cheating if he doesn't break up with her, but he doesn't want to hurt her feelings by ending things now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of cheating. The author says he doesn't want to cheat but wants to pursue other girls. If he's in a relationship with her, even if it's long-distance and not exclusive, pursuing others could be considered cheating depending on the terms they agreed upon. However, the user mentions that he hasn't set any clear boundaries about exclusivity. In the beginning, he was giving her the cold shoulder because he was scared she'd fall in love with him. Now, he's conflicted again. \n\nAnother point is communication. The author didn't confirm whether the relationship is exclusive. If she believes they're dating exclusively and he's pursuing others, that's a betrayal. But if the relationship was always casual or non-exclusive, then maybe it's different. The user didn't mention discussing the relationship's status. The girl said she loves him, and he hasn't reciprocated, but they're planning to meet again. That might imply a level of commitment even if it's not verbalized.\n\nAlso, the author is using her for experience while not wanting to hurt her. He's aware that breaking up would hurt her, so he's trying to wait. But by continuing to pursue others, he's leading her on. That could be emotionally manipulative. Even if he doesn't have romantic feelings, he's keeping her in a situation where she's emotionally invested, and he's not being honest about his intentions. That seems unfair to her.\n\nSo the key factors are: exclusivity expectations, communication, and emotional honesty. Since the author hasn't clarified the relationship's boundaries and is actively pursuing others while being with her, he's likely acting inconsiderately. Even if he's not in a formal relationship, the way he's handling things could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly damaging to her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
