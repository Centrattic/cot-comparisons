I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The key points here are the nature of the relationship and the intentions of the author.\n\nFirst, the relationship started via Tinder, and the girl became attached quickly, though they hadn't met yet. The author initially gave her the cold shoulder because he was scared of her falling in love, which might indicate he wasn't fully committed from the start. Then, after some time, they reconnected, had a romantic encounter, and she told him she loves him. The author didn't reciprocate but explained why. They planned to meet again, had a good time, and now he's considering pursuing other relationships because he's unsure about his feelings and wants to gain experience for a future \"soulmate.\"\n\nThe author mentions he doesn't want to cheat but feels he might if he continues this relationship. He's also concerned about breaking up with her because it might hurt her. The main issue here is whether the author is being honest and respectful in his current relationship while considering other options. \n\nSince the author hasn't explicitly mentioned being in a monogamous relationship with the girl, but the context implies they're in a romantic relationship (they met, had sex, she loves him), it's possible that the author is leading her on. If he's not committed to a monogamous relationship and is planning to pursue others, that could be deceitful if the girl assumes exclusivity. The author's intentions to \"get as much experience as I can\" for a future partner suggest a lack of commitment to the current relationship, which could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong if he's not truthful about his intentions and is using the relationship for experience while expecting her to be exclusive. The key factor here is transparency. If he's not upfront about his plans to pursue other relationships, he's being dishonest, which would make him the asshole. However, if the relationship was casual from the start and both parties agreed to non-monogamy, then it's different. But based on the information given, there's no indication that mutual understanding exists. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
