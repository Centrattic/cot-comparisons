I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met online. They have a history of on-and-off communication. She had a boyfriend at some point, but they reconnected and planned a visit. The author enjoyed their time together but now feels conflicted because he's growing too attached and fears the relationship might not be sustainable. He also mentions a mindset of wanting to gain experience with other girls before finding \"the one,\" but not wanting to cheat. His dilemma is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep this relationship while also pursuing others.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is in a committed (though long-distance) relationship. Is he in an exclusive relationship with her? The original post doesn't mention if they've discussed exclusivity. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. But if it's open or non-exclusive, maybe not. However, the user's question is about whether the author is wrong for doing both. \n\nAlso, the author hasn't committed to the relationship. He's planning to meet her again but is unsure about the future. He's not ready to commit emotionally and is worried about hurting her if he breaks up. But he's also not honest about his intentions with other girls. If he hasn't been clear about exclusivity, then pursuing others might be okay, but if the relationship was supposed to be exclusive and he's not being honest, that's a problem.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not ready for a long-term commitment and wants to explore other relationships. But if the other person isn't aware of that, he's being deceptive. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, the emotional attachment is real for her. If he's leading her on without being honest, that's manipulative. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to consider ethical aspects. The author is in a relationship and planning to meet her again, which suggests some level of commitment. Pursuing others without her knowledge would be a breach of trust. Even if it's a long-distance, casual setup, if there's a mutual understanding of exclusivity, then the author is in the wrong. If not, it's less clear. However, the fact that she expressed love and he didn't reciprocate but didn't end the relationship might imply he's in a situation where he's not honest about his intentions. \n\nSo, if the author is in an exclusive relationship and is pursuing others without her knowledge, that's definitely wrong. If the relationship is non-exclusive, maybe not. But the scenario doesn't clarify the exclusivity. The author's actions might be leading her on, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is maintaining a relationship while pursuing others, which could be deceitful if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive.\n"
