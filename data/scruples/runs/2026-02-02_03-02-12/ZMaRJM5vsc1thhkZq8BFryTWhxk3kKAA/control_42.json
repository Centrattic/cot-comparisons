I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other women. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met in person until recently when she visited him. He's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to commit, but also doesn't want to commit because he doesn't see her as his future partner. At the same time, he wants to date other women to gain experience for his future \"one.\"\n\nThe key points here are: he's in a committed relationship (or at least a romantic one) with this woman, and he's considering pursuing others. The question is whether that makes him the asshole. \n\nIn most relationships, especially ones where there's physical intimacy involved, exclusivity is expected. The author mentions they had sex during her visit, so it's reasonable to assume he's in a monogamous relationship unless otherwise stated. If he's pursuing other women without her knowledge or consent, that would be cheating, which is generally considered wrong. \n\nHe also hasn't addressed his intentions with her. By not being honest about his plans to date others, he might be leading her on. The fact that he's planning to break up later because he doesn't see her as his future partner shows he's not fully committed. But instead of being upfront, he's trying to delay the breakup while also pursuing others. That's being dishonest and manipulative.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for his future relationship. However, using someone else for practice without their knowledge isn't fair. Relationships require honesty and mutual respect. If he's not willing to commit and is planning to end things eventually, he should have done so earlier rather than involving her in a physical relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: he's in a relationship where he's not being honest about his intentions, planning to break up, and possibly cheating. That's definitely on the wrong side. The answer should be A.\n"
