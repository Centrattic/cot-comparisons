I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other relationships. The key points here are honesty and consent. The article mentions that the girl in the relationship is very affectionate and has expressed love, but the author hasn't reciprocated. Now, after spending time together, the author is feeling conflicted about their growing feelings and the possibility of not being able to commit. They also mention wanting to gain experience with other girls for future readiness.\n\nFirst, the author hasn't been entirely honest about their intentions. The girl is invested, and if the author is planning to pursue others, that's a significant issue. In a relationship, even if it's long-distance, exclusivity is typically implied unless otherwise discussed. The author's plan to \"pursue other girls\" without informing the girl could be seen as deceptive. \n\nThe girl is in a vulnerable position, having invested emotionally and even financially (buying a train ticket). The author's hesitation to commit and their intention to explore other relationships might lead to emotional harm when she eventually finds out. The author also mentions not wanting to break up now, which could be prolonging the inevitable and causing more pain.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that they want to avoid getting too deep into a relationship they can't sustain long-term. They acknowledge that they might not be the right partner for the girl and want to avoid hurting her. But the problem lies in the lack of communication and the author's decision to continue the relationship while planning to be unfaithful. \n\nIn relationships, consent and transparency are crucial. If the author is not ready to commit and is considering seeing others, they should have had an honest conversation about the relationship's boundaries. Without that, it's not just about cheating but about building trust and mutual understanding. The author's current approach could be seen as using the girl, which is unethical. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because they're engaging in a relationship without full honesty about their intentions, which can lead to emotional harm.\n"
