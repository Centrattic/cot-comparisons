I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other girls. The key points here are honesty and consent. \n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with a girl they met online. They had a connection, met up, and things were going well. But the author is afraid of developing deeper feelings and is thinking about pursuing others to gain experience for their future \"soulmate.\" They also mention not wanting to cheat but feeling they might if they continue with this current relationship.\n\nNow, the ethical issue here hinges on whether the author is being honest with their current partner. If the author hasn't told the girl that they're open to other relationships or that they're using her for experience, then they're being deceptive. Even if they don't want to break up with her right now because they don't want to hurt her, the fact that they're considering pursuing others without her knowledge is a problem. \n\nIn any relationship, whether it's exclusive or not, honesty is crucial. If the author is in an exclusive relationship (which it sounds like they are since they mention meeting in person and having a three-day visit), then pursuing others without informing their partner would be a breach of trust. The author's justification is that they don't want to \"fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me,\" implying they're using this relationship as practice. That's ethically questionable because it treats the current partner as a means to an end rather than valuing the relationship on its own terms.\n\nAdditionally, the author is aware that the girl is affectionate and has feelings for them, yet they're considering moving on without being honest. This could lead to emotional harm for the girl if she's invested and the author decides to leave later. The author's intention to maintain the relationship while pursuing others simultaneously without the partner's knowledge makes this a non-consensual arrangement, which is a key factor in determining if they're in the wrong.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the author is being honest with the girl about their intentions from the start, it's different. But in this case, there's no indication that the author discussed their plan to pursue others with the girl. Therefore, the author is being dishonest, which makes them at fault. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
