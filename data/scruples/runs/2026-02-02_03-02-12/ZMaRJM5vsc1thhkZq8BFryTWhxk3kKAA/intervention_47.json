I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship where they've met in person, had intimate moments, and the other girl has expressed love. They're considering continuing the relationship but also wanting to \"pursue other girls\" to gain experience for their future \"soulmate.\" The key here is whether the author is being honest with their current partner.\n\nThe author mentions they didn't reciprocate the love initially but continued the relationship. After meeting, their feelings grew, but they're still hesitant about committing long-term. Now they're considering pursuing others while staying in the relationship. That sounds like emotional infidelity or at least a breach of trust if the relationship isn't exclusive. \n\nThe author claims they don't want to break up because it would hurt the girl, but their actions (pursuing others) could lead to cheating. The problem here is consent and boundaries. If the relationship is monogamous, the author is in the wrong for planning to pursue others without the partner's knowledge. If it's non-monogamous and both parties are aware, it's different. But from the description, there's no indication that the girl is okay with this. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to \"mess it up\" with their future soulmate by gaining experience. However, they're already in a relationship, so pursuing others without consent is unethical. The pressure they feel might be their own fear of commitment, but that doesn't justify dishonesty or emotional harm. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're considering acting in a way that could deceive or harm their partner, which is not ethical in a committed relationship.\n"
