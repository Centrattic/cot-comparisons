I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship but is considering pursuing other girls. The relationship started online, and there was a period where the girl had a boyfriend. The author felt pressured because the girl became very attached, then they reconnected, had a meet-up, and things went well. Now, the author is conflicted because they don't want to commit fully but also don't want to end the relationship. They mention wanting to gain experience with other girls before finding their \"one,\" which makes me think they're considering being with multiple people at once.\n\nSo, the key points here: Is the author being dishonest or deceptive? Are they leading the girl on without intending to commit? The author hasn't explicitly said they're in a relationship, but they've been talking for a long time, met in person, had a sexual relationship, and there's been mutual affection. If the author is planning to pursue others while maintaining this relationship, that's a problem because it's likely not consensual. The author is using the excuse that they don't want to hurt the girl by breaking up, but that's not a valid reason to stay in a relationship if they aren't committed. They're also scared of the girl's feelings, which is more about their own fear than respecting her.\n\nAlso, the author's mentality of needing to \"gain experience\" suggests they're not treating this relationship seriously. The fact that they're worried about cheating if they keep it up implies they might be planning to be with others, which is a breach of trust. Even if it's not a formal monogamous relationship, when someone is in a romantic and sexual relationship with another person, pursuing others without consent is generally considered wrong. The author hasn't clarified boundaries with the girl, so proceeding could be seen as deceitful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
