I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the current one. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The guy met a girl on Tinder, they had a connection but he wasn't sure about her feelings. She became attached, then things cooled down because he pulled away. Later, they reconnect, she expresses love, but he doesn't reciprocate. They meet up, have a good time, and he's now worried about growing more attached while also wanting to explore other relationships. He feels pressure to not commit fully and wants to keep things open.\n\nThe key points here are whether the relationship is exclusive. The author hasn't mentioned if they're in a committed, exclusive relationship. If it's not exclusive, then pursuing others might be okay. But if it is exclusive, then he's being dishonest by seeking others. The problem is that the girl might believe they're in a monogamous relationship, and the author isn't clear about his intentions. \n\nHe also mentions not wanting to break up with her because it would hurt her, but he's not honest about his desire to pursue others. That's a red flag. Even if the relationship isn't explicitly exclusive, if the other girl believes it is, then the author is misleading her. The author is using her for companionship while planning to see others, which is unfair. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's trying to gain experience for the future, but that doesn't justify being in a relationship with someone else under false pretenses. It's not about his future; it's about respecting the current partner's feelings. The fact that he's afraid of commitment and wants to avoid a monogamous relationship now is his issue, but he's not being truthful with her. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading the other girl on without considering her feelings. Even if the relationship isn't exclusive, if there's an assumption of exclusivity, he's not upfront about his actions. That's where the mistake lies.\n"
