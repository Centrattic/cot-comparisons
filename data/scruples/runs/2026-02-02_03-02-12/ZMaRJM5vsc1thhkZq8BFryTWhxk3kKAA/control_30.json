I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is 22, and after a year of a long-distance relationship with this girl, they've met in person, and feelings have grown. The author is conflicted because they don't want to commit fully but also don't want to hurt the girl by ending things. They also mention wanting to gain experience with other girls before settling down.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girl they're in a relationship with has a history of being very affectionate and even said she loves them. They met in person, had an intimate encounter, and the author now feels pressured. The main issue is whether it's ethical to stay in a relationship while also pursuing others. \n\nThe author says they don't want to cheat but feel like they might if they continue. That's a red flag. If they're considering being with other people while in a relationship, that's typically considered cheating, unless the relationship is open and both parties agree. The post doesn't mention that the relationship is open, so it's implied it's monogamous. \n\nThe girl in question is clearly invested, as she bought a train ticket and stayed in the author's room. The author is keeping her at a distance emotionally, not reciprocating love, but still maintaining the relationship. This could be emotionally manipulative. The author is using the girl's affection and the time they've spent together, but not committing to a future with her. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to gain experience before finding a long-term partner. However, this is using the girl as a stepping stone, which isn't fair. The girl is being led on, and the author is causing her emotional distress by not being clear about their intentions. Even if the author doesn't want to break up with her, the fact that they're pursuing others while in a relationship is a breach of trust.\n\nThe key ethical issue here is honesty and commitment. If the author isn't willing to commit or be monogamous, they shouldn't be in a relationship where the other partner expects that. The author is putting the girl in a position where she's emotionally invested without the assurance of commitment. It's also important to consider that the girl might have a boyfriend again, as mentioned in the post. Wait, the author thought she had a boyfriend before, but they later started talking again. That adds another layer\u2014if the girl was with someone else during the time they were in contact, that might complicate things further, but the main issue is the current situation with the author's behavior.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not being honest about their intentions, is emotionally leading the girl on, and is considering being unfaithful. That makes them the asshole because they're not respecting the girl's feelings and are using the relationship for their own gain without commitment. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
