I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where they met through Tinder, talked for two months before she became attached. The author felt scared of her attachment, started giving her the cold shoulder because he feared she might fall in love. Then, after ten months, she wanted to catch up again, and they ended up meeting in person, had a good time, including sex. Now, the author is worried that his feelings are growing, but he doesn't want a long-term commitment yet. He's thinking of pursuing other girls while keeping this relationship, but he's afraid of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is whether the author is being deceptive or not. If he's in a committed relationship, then pursuing others would be wrong. But the user says the author hasn't technically confirmed the relationship status. The original post mentions that the girl had a boyfriend at some point during the ten months, but now she's visiting him. When she said she loves him, he didn't reciprocate and explained why. However, they were planning to meet and had an intimate encounter. The author is now conflicted because he's developing feelings but wants to explore other relationships to gain experience before committing. \n\nBut wait, the girl's actions might indicate she's in a committed LDR. If she's visiting him, staying in his room, and they had sex, that could be seen as a significant step in a relationship. The author's hesitation to say \"I love you\" and his plan to pursue others while maintaining this could be problematic. If the relationship isn't monogamous, then maybe it's okay. But the author didn't mention that they discussed boundaries. He's assuming he can pursue others without cheating, which might not be the case. Also, the girl might have expectations of exclusivity, especially after such a close interaction. The author's fear of hurting her by breaking up now suggests he's aware of the emotional impact. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being honest. If he's in a relationship where both parties expect exclusivity, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. But if the relationship isn't exclusive, then perhaps it's not. The problem is the author hasn't clarified this. He might be leading her on by maintaining the relationship without setting clear boundaries. Even if he doesn't consider it cheating, if the girl believes they're in a committed LDR, his actions could be seen as deceptive. The author should have had a conversation about his intentions and whether they're both okay with non-exclusive arrangements. Since he hasn't, and he's now considering pursuing others while keeping her, it's likely he's in the wrong because he's not being transparent, which could lead to emotional harm. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not communicating his intentions and might be in a situation where he's expected exclusivity without having discussed it.\n"
