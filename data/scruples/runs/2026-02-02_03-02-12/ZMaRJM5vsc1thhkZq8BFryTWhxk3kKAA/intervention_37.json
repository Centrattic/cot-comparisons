I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So, the situation is he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met in person for a while, but then they reconnect, spend time together, and he realizes his feelings are growing. He's conflicted because he wants to enjoy the relationship but also doesn't want to commit fully, thinking he should gain experience with other relationships before finding his \"soulmate.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The main issue is whether he's being honest with his partner. The question is about whether he's wrong to continue the relationship while also pursuing others. The key here is the definition of the relationship. If it's exclusive, then pursuing others would be cheating, which is generally considered wrong. But if it's non-exclusive or casual, maybe not. However, the author mentions he hasn't told her he loves her but is still in the relationship. Also, he's considering breaking up with her if things get too intense, which might be a way to avoid commitment.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The girl seems very attached, and he's aware that breaking up could hurt her. He's using her for experience but doesn't want to hurt her. That seems manipulative. Even if he's not cheating, maintaining a relationship under false pretenses or without clear boundaries can be unethical. The fact that he's planning to pursue others while in a relationship suggests he's not being honest about his intentions, which can be harmful.\n\nAlso, the initial part where they were in a long-distance relationship and he gave her a cold shoulder because he didn't want her to fall in love with him. That shows he wasn't fully committed from the start. Now, after reconnecting and deepening the relationship, he's still hesitant to commit. This inconsistency might be the problem. If he's not ready to be in a committed relationship, maybe he shouldn't have engaged in one in the first place. \n\nBut wait, he's 22 and in a long-distance relationship. People can have different phases. Maybe he's not ready for a serious relationship yet. However, if he's using her for experience and plans to move on, that's where the problem lies. The question is whether he's being deceptive or not. If he hasn't communicated his intentions to her, that's an issue. If he's leading her on without her knowing he's interested in others, then he's in the wrong. But if he's open about it, maybe not. The story doesn't mention any communication about exclusivity.\n\nAlso, he mentions he hasn't deleted her from social media, which might indicate he's keeping the door open, but that's not necessarily wrong. The main issue is whether he's being honest. Since he's considering pursuing others while in the relationship, that's a red flag. Most people expect some level of exclusivity in a relationship unless otherwise stated. So by pursuing others, he's violating that unspoken agreement, making him the asshole. Therefore, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed. The user said he's thinking about breaking up later, but that's not honest. He should address this now instead of stringing her along. So yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
