I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this long post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship who's considering pursuing other relationships. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy met a girl online, they had a connection, but he was scared of getting too attached. He gave her the cold shoulder, but after some time, they reconnected and eventually met in person. Now, after spending time together, he's realized he's growing feelings but also wants to explore other relationships. He's worried about cheating but doesn't want to break up with her because he thinks it would hurt her.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong to maintain a relationship while pursuing others. The author is honest about his feelings and intentions. He's not in a monogamous relationship, and from what's described, both parties haven't discussed exclusivity. The girl's boyfriend status isn't clear anymore because she had one before but maybe doesn't now. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's young and wants to gain experience before settling down. However, the problem arises if he's being non-monogamous without the other person's consent. Since the girl expressed love for him and he's keeping her in the loop, if he's considering pursuing others, he needs to be transparent. But the post doesn't mention if he's discussed this with her. \n\nIf he proceeds without her knowing, that would be deceptive and unethical. But if he's open about his intentions, then it's their decision. However, the author is conflicted because he doesn't want to hurt her but also doesn't see her as a long-term partner. This could lead to emotional harm regardless. The key question is whether he's being honest with the girl. If he's not and is leading her on, then he's in the wrong. If he's upfront, maybe it's a mutual arrangement. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to assess based on the situation. Since the author hasn't mentioned discussing non-monogamy with the girl and is considering pursuing others while in a relationship, that's a problem. So the answer might be A (wrong), but I need to be sure. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe not. But typically, unless specified, relationships are expected to be monogamous. So without that discussion, pursuing others is a breach of trust.\n"
