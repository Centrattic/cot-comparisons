I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met until recently, and after meeting, they had a nice three-day visit. Now he's feeling conflicted because he's grown more attached but doesn't want a serious commitment. He also mentions wanting to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future \"soulmate\" but doesn't want to cheat.\n\nFirst, the key points: The relationship is long-distance, and the guy isn't sure about his feelings. He hasn't committed to her, and he's considering pursuing others. The girl is very affectionate, even after he gave her the cold shoulder before. After the visit, he's worried about hurting her if he breaks up with her now but also fears getting too deep into a relationship that he doesn't want to be in long-term.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether keeping a relationship while intending to pursue others is wrong. In many relationships, fidelity is expected, but if this is casual or not defined, maybe it's different. The author mentions not wanting to cheat, which implies he's in a monogamous arrangement with her. If he's not honest about his intentions and continues to lead her on while seeing others, that could be deceitful. However, if he's upfront about his desire to explore other relationships and she's okay with it, then it's consensual. \n\nThe problem is that the author hasn't broken up with her yet and might be giving her false hope. The girl has invested a lot emotionally, and he's not sure about his commitment. By continuing the relationship while planning to pursue others, he's likely not being truthful to her. That can be seen as manipulative or emotionally abusive, even if his intent isn't malicious. The fact that he's considering breaking up later but not now suggests he's using her to avoid hurting her feelings immediately, which is a red flag.\n\nAlso, his mentality about needing experience for his future partner is a bit problematic. It implies that current relationships are just stepping stones, which can be disrespectful to the partner involved. The girl might believe they have a future together if he doesn't make it clear that he's not looking for a serious commitment.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author is in the wrong because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading the girl on while planning to pursue others. This lack of transparency and commitment can hurt her emotionally. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
