I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 22, met a girl on Tinder, they talked for two months without meeting. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He started giving her the cold shoulder out of fear she'd fall in love. After ten months, he reconnects with her, they talk a lot, she says she loves him, he doesn't reciprocate but explains why. They plan a meet-up, she visits him, and they have a great time. After she leaves, he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure. He mentions wanting to gain experience with other girls to avoid messing up with his future partner but doesn't want to cheat. He's torn between continuing the relationship and pursuing others, not wanting to break her heart.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is in a committed long-distance relationship but is considering pursuing other girls. The question is whether that makes him the asshole. \n\nFirst, the author hasn't explicitly stated that the relationship is exclusive. However, in most long-distance relationships, especially after meeting and having a sexual relationship, exclusivity is often implied. The author is keeping her in his life while also looking to other options, which could be seen as deceptive or unfair. \n\nHe mentions she said she loves him, and he didn't reciprocate but explained why. However, after meeting and deepening the relationship, he's now worried about his own feelings. The fact that he's planning to continue the relationship while also pursuing others could lead to emotional harm for her if she believes the relationship is exclusive. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience for his future relationship, but this is a manipulative mindset. It's using the current relationship as a stepping stone rather than being honest about his intentions. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then perhaps it's a matter of communication. But if it is exclusive, then he's being dishonest and leading her on, which is unethical. \n\nHe also expresses fear of hurting her if he breaks up, but that doesn't justify his actions. Honesty is often better, even if it's painful. By not being upfront about his intentions to pursue others, he's setting her up for potential heartbreak if she isn't aware of his plans. \n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong because he's maintaining a relationship where exclusivity is implied, while simultaneously planning to pursue others without her knowledge. This lack of transparency is deceitful and could cause emotional harm.\n"
