I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl they met on Tinder. They had a connection, but the author was initially scared of her attachment. Then, after some time, they reconnect, and she ends up loving him. They meet, have a good time, and now the author is feeling conflicted because their feelings might grow too strong, or they might want to pursue other relationships. The key point is that the author is considering pursuing other girls while staying in this relationship. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the relationship dynamics. If the relationship isn't exclusive, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the story doesn't mention any discussion about exclusivity. The author mentions they haven't deleted her from social media, which might indicate they're still together. Also, they plan to meet again, which suggests they're in a committed phase. \n\nThe problem is that the author is thinking about pursuing other girls. If the relationship is monogamous, then pursuing others would be a problem. However, if it's open or non-exclusive, maybe not. But since the author hasn't mentioned discussing this with the girl, it's likely she expects exclusivity. The author also feels pressured because of her affection and doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up. \n\nAnother angle is the author's reasoning. They want to gain experience for future relationships. While that's a personal goal, acting on it by pursuing others without being honest could be deceitful. The author is in a position where they're leading the girl on, possibly giving her false hope, especially since they didn't reciprocate her love initially but then became closer. \n\nThe key ethical issue here is whether the author is being honest and respectful to the girl. If they're in a de facto relationship with expectations of exclusivity, then pursuing others is a breach of trust. The author is aware of the potential harm but is choosing not to act on it now, which might not be ethical. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in a committed, affectionate relationship and is considering non-exclusive behavior without the other person's knowledge. That would be considered wrong because it's dishonest and could lead to emotional harm. Therefore, the answer leans towards A.\n"
