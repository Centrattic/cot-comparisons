I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 22-year-old guy in a long-distance relationship who is considering pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. He met a girl on Tinder, they had a connection but he wasn't sure about the attachment she showed. He pulled back, then later reconnected when she reached out. They met, had a good time, and she confessed her love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They continued the relationship with plans to meet again, but he's now conflicted because he doesn't see her as a future partner and wants to gain experience with others before \"the one.\" He doesn't want to cheat, but feels he might if he continues this. The question is whether he's the asshole (A) for wanting to keep her while pursuing others, or not (B).\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, relationships typically require honesty and mutual understanding. If he's in a committed relationship, pursuing others would be cheating. However, the user mentioned that the relationship is long-distance and hasn't been defined as exclusive. The girl bought a train ticket to visit him, and they had intimate moments. The key here is whether both parties are aware of the non-exclusive nature of the relationship. If the girl believes it's exclusive and the author isn't, then he might be in the wrong by not being honest. But the author hasn't explicitly stated that it's exclusive, so maybe the girl isn't aware of his intentions. \n\nThe author's main dilemma is that he's using her for experience while not reciprocating her feelings. Even if the relationship isn't defined as exclusive, there's an emotional component here. The girl is clearly invested, and the author might be leading her on, which can be considered inconsiderate. However, if he's upfront about his intentions from the start, it's different. Since the author hasn't mentioned being honest about his plans to pursue others, it's possible he's not transparent, which could make him the asshole. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is scared of commitment and is using the \"experience\" as a reason to delay a real commitment. But if the girl is okay with the arrangement and knows he's not looking for a long-term relationship, then maybe it's not his fault. The problem arises if he's not honest and is giving false hope. Since he hasn't broken up with her and is planning to continue the relationship, but also wants to date others, this could be seen as emotionally manipulative if the girl isn't aware.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions depend on his honesty with the girl. If he's not clear about his intentions and is leading her on without her knowledge, then he's in the wrong. If both parties understand it's non-exclusive, maybe not. But since the girl has expressed love and he's not reciprocating, keeping her in the dark could be unethical. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is potentially exploiting her feelings without clarity.\n"
