I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They've been talking for a year, even though he wasn't sure about her feelings initially. Then he started giving her the cold shoulder because he felt she was too attached. They reconnected later, she bought a train ticket to visit him, they spent three days together, had sex, and he's now conflicted because his feelings have grown, but he's also afraid of getting too attached. He wants to keep the relationship going but also pursue other girls to gain experience for his future \"soulmate.\" He doesn't want to cheat but feels like he might if he continues this.\n\nFirst, the key issue is whether he's being honest with her. Since they're in a relationship, even if it's long-distance, he's considering pursuing other girls. That sounds like cheating, even if he's not currently doing it. The problem is that maintaining a relationship while actively looking to pursue others is generally considered unethical. It's important to consider the expectations in the relationship. If it's not explicitly an open relationship, then pursuing others would be a betrayal of trust.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that she bought a train ticket to visit him, stayed in his room, and there was intimacy. That seems like a committed situation. If he's planning to pursue other girls, that's a big red flag. The fact that he's not ready to commit because he wants to find his \"soulmate\" later doesn't justify his actions. He's leading her on, which could hurt her when she finds out. \n\nHe also says he's scared of breaking up with her because she might get hurt, but he's not breaking up with her. Instead, he's keeping her in the loop while entertaining other options. That's not fair. The girl is showing strong feelings (even declaring love), and he's not reciprocating, yet he's not being honest about his intentions to explore other relationships. \n\nAnother point is that he's using the excuse of \"gaining experience\" to justify his behavior. However, that's a common excuse for not committing and potentially being dishonest. The ethical thing would be to either be upfront about his intentions or to step back if he's not ready for a serious relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not being honest with his partner and is considering actions that would likely hurt her. Even if he hasn't acted on pursuing other girls yet, the intention to do so while maintaining the current relationship is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
