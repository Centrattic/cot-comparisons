I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is a 22-year-old guy who got into a situation where he's in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They had an emotional connection, met up, and she loves him, but he's not ready to commit fully. He's also considering pursuing other relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are the nature of the relationship and the expectations of both parties. The author hasn't explicitly mentioned if the relationship is monogamous or if there's an understanding about exclusivity. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. However, the author hasn't confirmed whether the girl knows about his intentions to pursue others. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience before a long-term commitment. That's a common perspective, but it's important to consider the other person's feelings and whether they're aware of his intentions. The girl seems to have strong feelings for him, and he might be leading her on if he's not honest about his plans to be with others. Even if he doesn't cheat, his approach could be emotionally manipulative or deceitful if he's not upfront.\n\nAnother angle is the communication between both parties. The author didn't set clear boundaries from the start. If the girl believed it was a serious relationship and the author isn't committed to exclusivity, that's a problem. The author's hesitation to break up for fear of hurting her might be selfish, as it's unfair to keep someone in a situation where they're not fully committed.\n\nLong-distance relationships already require more effort and trust. Adding the element of pursuing others could exacerbate issues of trust and emotional harm. Even if the author isn't cheating, the emotional investment from the girl might not be reciprocated in the same way, leading to potential heartbreak for her when he eventually moves on.\n\nHowever, the author's age and life stage might be a factor. At 22, people might be more open to casual or non-exclusive relationships. But in this case, the girl expressed love, and the author didn't reciprocate. That could indicate a mismatch in relationship goals. The author needs to be honest about his intentions to avoid leading her on.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as unethical if he's not transparent about his intentions. Keeping the relationship while pursuing others without the girl's knowledge or consent is problematic. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the potential for emotional harm and lack of clear communication about exclusivity.\n"
