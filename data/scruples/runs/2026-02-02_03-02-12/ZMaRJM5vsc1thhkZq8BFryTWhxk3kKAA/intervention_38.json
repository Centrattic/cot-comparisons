I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. Initially, she became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He then gave her the cold shoulder because he feared she might fall in love with him. Later, after reconnecting, they planned a visit, had a good time, and she confessed her love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They're planning to meet again, and he now feels his feelings have grown, but he's worried about commitment. He wants to keep her while also pursuing other girls to gain experience, without cheating.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the long-distance nature, the lack of a formal commitment, and the author's intention to pursue others. In a long-distance relationship, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. The author hasn't explicitly labeled the relationship as exclusive. Since they've never met before the recent visit and he hasn't committed to being in a monogamous relationship, he might not be in the wrong. However, after the visit, they had intimate moments. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. But since the author hasn't confirmed exclusivity, he might still have the freedom to explore other connections. \n\nThe author mentions he doesn't want to \"cheat,\" which implies he values honesty. But the issue here is whether he's being honest with his current partner. If he's leading her on by keeping the relationship open without clear boundaries, that could be unethical. However, if their arrangement is non-exclusive from the start, then maybe not. The problem lies in the communication and mutual expectations. The author is using the girl to practice for a future \"real\" relationship, which might be manipulative. He's also causing potential emotional harm by making her believe there's a chance for a future when he's not ready to commit. \n\nSo, even if they aren't in a formal relationship, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. He's enjoying benefits (her affection, the visit) without being fully committed, and now plans to pursue others. That might be the asshole move because he's not being transparent about his intentions. The girl might feel misled if she thought the relationship was progressing beyond casual interactions. The author's fear of commitment and desire to gain experience is his own issue, but using someone else in the process without clear communication about his lack of exclusivity is where he could be at fault. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is using the relationship to gain experience rather than being upfront and respectful of her feelings.\n"
