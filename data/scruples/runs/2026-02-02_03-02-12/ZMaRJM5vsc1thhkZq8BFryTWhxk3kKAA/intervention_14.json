I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The key points here are the dynamics of the relationship and the intentions of both parties.\n\nFirst, the author started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He gave her the cold shoulder, fearing her growing affection. Then, after some time, they reconnected, and she expressed love. He didn't reciprocate but explained his feelings. They planned a meet-up, had a good time, and now he's conflicted about his feelings and wants to pursue other relationships without cheating. His reasoning is that he wants experience for future relationships.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is being honest and respectful. If the relationship was exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. However, the author didn't clarify if they had an exclusive arrangement. If he hasn't committed to exclusivity, he might not be in the wrong. But if the relationship was implied to be exclusive and he's now pursuing others without her knowledge, that's where the issue lies. \n\nAlso, the author is concerned about hurting her if he breaks up, but he doesn't want to end it. This suggests he's keeping her in a situation where he's not fully committed, which could be emotionally manipulative. Even if he's not cheating now, planning to pursue others while in a relationship, regardless of distance, is a red flag. The author's approach might lead to her being used as a backup while he explores other options. \n\nIn many relationships, exclusivity is expected unless otherwise stated. Since the author hasn't addressed this with her, he's not being transparent. His mindset of \"getting experience\" implies he's treating this as a non-serious relationship, which might not align with her feelings. If she's in love and he's not, continuing the relationship while pursuing others could be seen as dishonest and selfish. \n\nSo, even if there's no explicit cheating, the core of the issue is about honesty and mutual expectations. If the author isn't upfront about his intentions, he's in the wrong. The answer here would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being transparent and is keeping someone in an uncertain situation while planning to pursue others, which can be considered emotionally harmful.\n"
