I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The author is 22, met a girl on Tinder, had a long-distance relationship, met her, and now feels conflicted because he's developing stronger feelings but also wants to keep seeing other girls. He doesn't want to cheat but is afraid he might if he continues.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is being dishonest or misleading. The key points are whether the relationship is exclusive and if he's transparent with the girl. The original situation mentions that they were planning to meet, had an intimate encounter, and the girl expressed love, but the author didn't reciprocate. However, he's now considering pursuing other girls while keeping the relationship going. If the girl believes they're exclusive or in a committed relationship, then the author is being deceptive by not clarifying the terms. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wants to gain experience before committing to a long-term relationship. However, if he's not honest about his intentions and the relationship isn't clearly defined as non-exclusive, then he's in the wrong because he's leading her on. The fact that she's fun but not his \"future soulmate\" suggests he's treating her as a temporary partner, which could be emotionally manipulative if she's not aware. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he hasn't set boundaries. If he's not upfront about his desire to pursue others, that's a problem. The girl might think they're in a monogamous relationship, which would make his actions deceitful. Even if he doesn't plan to cheat, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship (even long-distance) without consent is typically considered a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being transparent about his intentions and is potentially misleading the girl about the relationship's exclusivity. The key issue is honesty and consent in the relationship's terms.\n"
