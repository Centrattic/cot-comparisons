I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author is in a long-distance relationship and considering pursuing other relationships. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the relationship started over Tinder, and there was a lot of online interaction. The guy was afraid the girl was too attached, so he pulled back. Then, after some time, they reconnect, she moves to be with him, and things are great. Now, after meeting, he's feeling conflicted because he doesn't want to commit fully and is thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience for a future \"soulmate.\"\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's ethical to maintain a relationship while pursuing others. The question is about fidelity and honesty. If the author is in a relationship, even a long-distance one, then pursuing others without the partner's knowledge or consent would be cheating. But in this case, the author hasn't explicitly defined the relationship's status. He mentions they met, had a good time, and she's visiting again, but he's unsure about his feelings. However, he's considering being with other girls, which could be seen as deceitful if the current relationship is monogamous.\n\nAnother angle is the girl's feelings. She expressed love, and he didn't reciprocate but didn't break up with her either. He's now considering continuing the relationship but also wanting to explore others. This could lead to emotional harm to her if she's not aware of his intentions. The author's reasoning is that he wants to \"gain experience\" for a future relationship, which suggests he's not committed to this one, potentially making it a casual or non-exclusive arrangement. However, if the girl believes it's a serious relationship, then the author is being dishonest by not setting boundaries upfront.\n\nThe key factors are consent and communication. If the author and the girl have not discussed their relationship's terms (like exclusivity), then pursuing others without her knowledge is a breach of trust. Even if it's a long-distance, the emotional investment from her side (expressing love) implies she might have expectations of exclusivity. The author's fear of hurting her by breaking up might not excuse the potential deceit. The ethical stance here would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being transparent about his intentions and is likely leading her on while planning to engage with others. That's not fair to her, regardless of his reasoning.\n"
