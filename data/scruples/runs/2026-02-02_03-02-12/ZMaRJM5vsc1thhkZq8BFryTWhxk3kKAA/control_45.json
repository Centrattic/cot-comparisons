I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship where they met online, and the other person became very attached. The author felt scared because they didn't reciprocate the same level of attachment initially. They later met up, had a three-day visit, and the girl expressed love, but the author didn't return those feelings. Now, the author is conflicted because they enjoy the relationship but also feel the need to explore other options to prepare for a future \"real\" relationship. The key issue here is whether the author is being deceptive or unfair by not committing fully and instead planning to pursue other girls.\n\nThe author mentions not wanting to cheat but feels like they might if they continue the relationship. That's a problem because engaging in other relationships without full transparency or commitment can be considered emotionally cheating. The other person, the girl, seems to be very emotionally invested, while the author is holding back. If the author is keeping the relationship going while also seeking others, they're not being honest about their intentions, which can lead to emotional harm if the girl isn't aware of this.\n\nIn relationships, especially when there's emotional intimacy and physical contact, both parties should have clear expectations. If the author isn't ready to commit and is actively pursuing others, that's dishonest and can be seen as manipulative. The girl deserves to know if the author isn't fully committed, to avoid getting hurt later. The author's reasoning\u2014that breaking up now would hurt her\u2014doesn't justify the deception. The right approach would be to be upfront about their intentions or end the relationship to avoid leading her on.\n"
