I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the provided scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the man is considering pursuing other relationships while maintaining the current one. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man started a relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. Initially, he was concerned about her attachment level and gave her the cold shoulder. Later, after reconnecting, they met in person, had a good time, and she confessed her love. He didn't reciprocate but explained why. They plan to meet again, but he's now worried about growing feelings and the pressure of the relationship. He wants to continue seeing her but also wants to pursue other girls to gain experience for his future relationship.\n\nNow, the main ethical question here is about honesty and commitment. If the relationship is exclusive, then pursuing others would be a breach of trust. The man's approach is a bit ambiguous. He hasn't explicitly stated whether he told the girl it's non-exclusive. If he hasn't, then he's being deceptive. Even if it's non-exclusive, the fact that she's emotionally invested and he's not reciprocating the love might be problematic. \n\nHe mentions he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, but at the same time, he's considering moving on. The core issue here is consent and transparency. If both parties are aware and agree to a non-exclusive arrangement, then it's their choice. However, if the girl believes it's exclusive and he's not being honest, that's where the problem lies. \n\nAnother angle is the man's own feelings. He's conflicted, which is understandable, but the key is whether he's being truthful with himself and the other person. The fact that he's planning to pursue others while maintaining the current relationship could be seen as manipulative if there's an expectation of exclusivity. \n\nSo, considering all that, if the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's not upfront about wanting to date others, then he's in the wrong. But if it's an open relationship and both agree, then it's not. The problem is that the scenario doesn't clarify whether they've discussed the nature of the relationship. The girl might be under the impression it's exclusive, especially after she confessed her feelings and he didn't reciprocate but continued the relationship. \n\nTherefore, the man's intentions to pursue others without clear communication could be considered unethical. He's not being honest, which is a key component of a healthy relationship. So the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not being transparent about his intentions, which could lead to emotional harm for the girl.\n"
