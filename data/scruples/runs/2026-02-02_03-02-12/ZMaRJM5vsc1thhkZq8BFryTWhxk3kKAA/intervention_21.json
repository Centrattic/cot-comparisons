I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship and pursuing other girls. The author is 22, had a relationship that started online, they met, had a good time, but he's unsure about his feelings and wants to explore other options without cheating.\n\nFirst, the key points. The author is in a committed relationship where they've met, had sex, and planned future visits. The problem is he's considering seeing other girls while in this relationship. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nIn a committed relationship, exclusivity is usually expected unless otherwise agreed. The author mentions he doesn't want to cheat, but the idea of pursuing others is on his mind. Even if he doesn't cheat, the intention to be non-exclusive could be a problem. However, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. But why?\n\nMaybe because he's not currently cheating, just thinking about it. But relationships are about mutual expectations. If he hasn't discussed this with his partner, she might not be aware of his intentions. The author also says he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, but his actions (pursuing others) could still hurt her if she's expecting exclusivity.\n\nThe term \"long-distance\" can sometimes allow for more flexibility, but it's still a relationship. The fact that they met in person and had a physical relationship complicates things. If he's not ready to commit, maybe the right move is to end it now to avoid leading her on. However, the author doesn't want to break up, so he's in a dilemma between his current feelings and future intentions.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's planning to pursue others, then yes, he's not being honest. But if the relationship is open (which he hasn't mentioned), then maybe not. Since the scenario doesn't indicate that the relationship is non-exclusive, the author is in the wrong for considering pursuing others without her knowledge or consent. Therefore, answer A.\n"
