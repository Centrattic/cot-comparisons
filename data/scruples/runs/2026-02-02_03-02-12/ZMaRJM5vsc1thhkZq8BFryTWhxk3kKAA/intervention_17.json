I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is a 22-year-old guy who's been in a LDR with a girl he met on Tinder. They never met until recently, and after a weekend together, he's developed stronger feelings but isn't sure if she's his future partner. He wants to gain experience with other girls before committing long-term, but he's conflicted about cheating.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the LDR and the author's intention to pursue other relationships. In a committed relationship, even if it's long-distance, exclusivity is typically expected. The author hasn't explicitly stated that the relationship is non-exclusive. If he's planning to be with other girls without the mutual agreement of both parties, that could be considered cheating. The girl in the LDR might believe they're in a monogamous relationship, especially since they've met and had intimate moments. \n\nThe author mentions he doesn't want to break up with her because it would hurt her, but he's not ready to commit fully. This could be seen as using her emotionally while avoiding deeper commitment. Even if his intentions are to prepare for a future relationship, it's not fair to the current partner. The pressure he feels might stem from his own uncertainty, but that doesn't justify his actions if he's keeping her in the dark about his intentions. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about gaining experience is a bit of an excuse. It's valid to want to explore before settling down, but that should be done transparently. If he's not honest about his desire to pursue others, he's being dishonest and potentially leading her on. The girl has invested time and emotion, and if she's in a monogamous relationship, the author's actions would be a breach of trust. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's considering non-monogamous behavior without the other person's consent. Even if he doesn't act on it immediately, the intention is there, and that undermines the trust and commitment expected in a relationship.\n"
