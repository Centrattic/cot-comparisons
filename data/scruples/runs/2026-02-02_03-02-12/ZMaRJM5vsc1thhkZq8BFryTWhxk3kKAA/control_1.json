I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The author is in a long-distance relationship but wants to pursue other girls. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl on Tinder, they talked for two months without meeting. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable. He then gave her the cold shoulder. Later, after some time, he reached out again, and they reconnect. She says she loves him, but he doesn't reciprocate the love. They plan to meet, spend time together, including intimate moments. Now he's worried his feelings are growing and he might want to pursue others, but he doesn't want to break up with her because he thinks it would hurt her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is the author in a committed relationship? The original post says it's a long-distance relationship. If it's a committed relationship, then pursuing other girls would be a problem. But if it's casual or open, maybe not. However, the author mentions he's in a long-distance relationship and is planning to \"pursue other girls in his town.\" The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nThe author also says he doesn't want to cheat, but he feels like he might if he continues the current relationship. That suggests he's considering being with others while still in a relationship. That's typically considered cheating unless it's an open relationship. The problem is, the author hasn't mentioned that the relationship is open. He also says the girl is fun but not his future soulmate. So he's treating her as a temporary arrangement, which could be seen as using her.\n\nThe other issue is the initial part where he gave her the cold shoulder when she became too attached. That might have been inconsiderate, but the main question is about current actions. If he's in a relationship (even if not formalized) and is planning to pursue others, then yes, that's deceitful. The girl has invested emotionally, bought a ticket to visit him, and he's now considering moving on. That's not being honest with her. The author's reasoning is that breaking up would hurt her, but staying in a relationship where he's not fully committed is also harmful in the long run. So, the answer would likely be A (in the wrong) because he's not being truthful and is considering being with others while in a relationship, which is generally considered unethical unless agreed upon.\n"
