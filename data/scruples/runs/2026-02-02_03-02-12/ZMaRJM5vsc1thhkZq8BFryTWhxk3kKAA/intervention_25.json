I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to maintain a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author met a girl online, and she became very attached, but he wasn't sure about his feelings. He gave her the cold shoulder out of fear. Later, they reconnect, she falls in love, and they meet in person. Now, he's worried he's developing stronger feelings and might want to break up, but he doesn't want to hurt her. He also mentions wanting to pursue other girls for experience before finding his \"one.\"\n\nHmm. The key points here are about honesty and consent in relationships. The author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance. If he's considering pursuing other girls, that's a red flag. Unless it's an open relationship, which isn't mentioned here, having feelings for others while in a committed relationship can be problematic. The original post says he's not cheating yet, but he's planning to pursue others. That's a boundary issue. Even if his intentions are good, like not wanting to hurt her, he's not being honest about his current feelings and future plans. The girl is invested, and he's not being upfront about his intentions. That's disrespectful. So, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because he's not being truthful and is leading her on while planning to be with others. \n\nWait, but he mentions he hasn't cheated yet and is considering breaking up after some time. However, the fact remains that he's not honest about his intentions at the start. If he's going to pursue others, he should be upfront. Otherwise, he's misleading her. So, the answer is A (in the wrong).\n"
