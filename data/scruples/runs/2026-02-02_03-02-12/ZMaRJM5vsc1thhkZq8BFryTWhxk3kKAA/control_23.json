I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author is maintaining it but also considering pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship dynamics. The user met a girl on Tinder, they talked for two months without meeting. She became very attached, which made him uncomfortable, so he pulled away. Later, after some time, they reconnect, she still likes him, they meet up, spend three days together, have sex, and she says she loves him. The author doesn't reciprocate the love but says he enjoys her company. Now he's worried about the long-distance aspect and his own feelings growing, but also doesn't want to commit fully. He also mentions his mentality of wanting to gain experience with other girls to avoid messing up with his future partner.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is being dishonest or manipulating the situation. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive, then pursuing other girls would make him the asshole. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The user hasn't explicitly stated whether the relationship is exclusive. However, in most relationships, especially after meeting and having intimate moments, exclusivity is implied unless otherwise stated. The author hasn't communicated his intentions clearly. He's keeping her on a string, not reciprocating her feelings, and then considering other relationships. That's not fair to her. He's also planning to break things off later, which could hurt her more. So, he's not being honest and is leading her on without clear boundaries. Even if he's not cheating yet, his intentions are problematic. Therefore, the answer is yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
