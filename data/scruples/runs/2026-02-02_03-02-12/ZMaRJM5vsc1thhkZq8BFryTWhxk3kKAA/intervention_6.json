I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is in a situation where he's with a girl he met online, they've had a long LDR, met up, had a good time, but he's unsure about his feelings. He's considering keeping her while also seeing other girls to gain experience for future relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author mentioned that the girl said she loves him, but he hasn't reciprocated. They were planning to meet again. Now, he's thinking about pursuing others. The key issue here is honesty and communication. If the relationship is supposed to be monogamous, then pursuing others would be a problem. But if it's not clear whether they're exclusive, the author might be in the wrong for not setting boundaries.\n\nWait, the author hasn't explicitly stated whether he's in a committed relationship with her. He said they were planning to meet again, but he hasn't confirmed if they're in a relationship. However, she did express love for him, and they've been intimate. That might imply a level of exclusivity, even if it's unspoken. If the author is seeing other people without her knowledge, that's a breach of trust even if he hasn't officially labeled the relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he's not ready for a long-term commitment and wants to explore other relationships to prepare for the \"right one.\" That's his personal choice, but if he's not honest with his current partner, that's an issue. He's also concerned about hurting her if he breaks up, but continuing the relationship while being emotionally and physically involved with others could be seen as manipulative or inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle: the author is 22, which is young, and many people at that age experiment with relationships. However, the ethical responsibility is to be upfront about intentions. If he's not open about seeing others, he's in the wrong. The question is whether he's being deceptive. The post doesn't mention if he's communicated his intentions to the girl. If he hasn't, then yes, he's in the wrong. If he has and she's okay with it, maybe not. But the post doesn't indicate that he's discussed this with her. So, by default, pursuing others in a relationship where exclusivity is expected (even if not explicitly stated) is wrong. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
