I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to figure it out.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 22, had a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They talked for a while, but he started giving her the cold shoulder because he feared she was getting too attached. Later, after some time, they reconnected, met up, had a good time, and she's now visiting him. He's now worried because his feelings have grown, and he's considering pursuing other girls to gain experience before finding a soulmate. But he doesn't want to break up with her, as that would hurt her. The main issue is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep her while also seeking others.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key factors here are the nature of the relationship and the expectations both parties have. The author initially gave mixed signals, then reconnected and had a meaningful time together. The problem arises if the relationship is monogamous. If he's pursuing other girls while in a relationship, even if it's long-distance, that's typically considered cheating or at least a breach of trust. \n\nThe author mentions he hasn't committed to a relationship where exclusivity is required. However, when he met her in person and they had a romantic and sexual encounter, that might imply a level of commitment. If he's now considering pursuing others, even if he doesn't want to cheat, he's setting himself up for a situation where he can't maintain honesty. The issue is whether he's being deceptive. If the relationship isn't exclusive, maybe it's not wrong, but if it's implied to be monogamous, then yes, he's in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the author is using the \"I want experience for the future\" excuse. This is a common justification for non-monogamy, but unless both parties are on board, it's not acceptable. The girl in question has expressed love for him, and he hasn't reciprocated, but he's still keeping her as a partner. That's a form of emotional manipulation. He's leading her on, knowing he might not be the one but still keeping her in the loop. That's unkind.\n\nThe author is also concerned about breaking up with her and hurting her. However, by not being honest about his intentions and pursuing others, he's already causing potential harm. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the relationship is supposed to be exclusive and he's not adhering to that, then yes. If it's open, then no. But there's no indication that the relationship is open. The girl's love declaration and his acceptance of a three-day visit in his shared room suggests a level of seriousness. Therefore, his plan to pursue others while in this situation is deceitful and unethical.\n\nSo the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's engaging in a potentially deceptive and unfaithful behavior by pursuing others in a relationship where exclusivity is expected. Even if he doesn't cheat, the intention to seek others while being in a relationship is wrong.\n"
