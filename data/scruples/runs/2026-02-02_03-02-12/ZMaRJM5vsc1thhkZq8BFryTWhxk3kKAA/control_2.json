I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while pursuing other girls. The author is 22, and the situation involves a girl he met on Tinder a year ago. They had a connection, but he became distant because he was scared of her getting too attached. Later, they reconnected, met up, and had a good time. Now, he's worried about growing feelings and not wanting to commit, so he's considering pursuing other relationships while keeping this one.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the nature of the relationship. They met online, never met until recently, and now he's in a situation where he's trying to manage his feelings and his desire to explore other options. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep her while also seeing others.\n\nThe author mentions that he's in a long-distance relationship but also wants to \"pursue other girls.\" If the relationship is meant to be exclusive, then pursuing others would be a problem. But does he know if the relationship is exclusive? The user doesn't explicitly state that they discussed exclusivity. The woman told him she loves him, but he didn't reciprocate. However, they were planning to meet and had a three-day visit where they were intimate. It sounds like there's a serious connection on her part, but he's not sure about his own commitment.\n\nIf the relationship is not explicitly non-exclusive, then by pursuing others while maintaining the relationship, he might be being deceptive. Even if he's not cheating, the act of pursuing others while in a relationship (even if it's long-distance) can be seen as a breach of trust or commitment. The problem is that he's using the relationship without fully committing, which could lead to emotional harm when he eventually leaves. \n\nHe also mentions he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up now but wants to wait. However, if he's already considering pursuing others, that might indicate he's not emotionally invested in a long-term commitment. The fact that he's trying to gather experience for a future \"one\" suggests he's not ready for a serious relationship now, which might not be fair to the girl who has strong feelings for him. \n\nThe key points are: Is the relationship exclusive? If yes, then pursuing others is wrong. If not, maybe it's okay, but he should be honest. However, since she's put in a lot of emotional investment (loved him, bought a train ticket, stayed in his room), it's likely she expects some level of exclusivity. The author's hesitation and desire to avoid commitment while still engaging with her could be seen as a way to avoid responsibility, which makes him the asshole because he's leading her on without clear boundaries. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
