I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person in the long post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a guy in a long-distance relationship who's also considering pursuing other girls. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy met a girl online, they had a long-distance relationship. He wasn't sure about his feelings and gave her the cold shoulder before. Then they reconnected, met in person, and things got serious. Now he's worried about his growing feelings and the pressure to commit, so he's thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience before finding his \"one.\" But he doesn't want to cheat and is conflicted.\n\nThe main issue is whether he's being dishonest or manipulative. If he's in a relationship, even a long-distance one, pursuing others could be a problem. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The key factors here are communication and mutual understanding. If both parties are aware of the situation and have agreed to it, maybe it's not wrong. But if he's leading her on without being honest about his intentions to explore other relationships, then he's being deceptive.\n\nThe user mentions that he hasn't broken up with her yet and is planning to wait to see if things calm down. But he's still planning to pursue others. That could be a problem because he's maintaining a relationship while looking elsewhere. Even if he doesn't want to hurt her, not being upfront about his intentions could be considered wrong. \n\nAlso, the girl is very attached and has invested emotionally. If he's not ready to commit and is using her for experience, that's not fair. The guy's approach might be selfish, prioritizing his own need for experience over her feelings. The fact that he's planning to break up later might not make it right because the deception is still there. \n\nSo, putting it all together: If the relationship is monogamous and he's not honest about his intentions to pursue others, then yes, he's in the wrong. But if it's an open or casual relationship, maybe not. The post doesn't mention any agreement about exclusivity, so it's implied that it's supposed to be monogamous. Therefore, pursuing others without her knowledge is deceitful, making him the asshole. Answer A.\n"
