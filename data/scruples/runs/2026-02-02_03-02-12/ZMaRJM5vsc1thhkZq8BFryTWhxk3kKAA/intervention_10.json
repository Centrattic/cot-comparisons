I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe guy is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder a year ago. They never met in person, but she became very attached. He felt scared and pulled away. Then, ten months later, he reconnects with her, they meet in person, have a great time, and she says she loves him. He doesn't say it back, but they plan to meet again. Now he's worried his feelings might grow too much and he might not want a future with her. He also mentions wanting to pursue other girls to gain experience before finding his \"one.\"\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for keeping the relationship while pursuing others. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the relationship is long-distance. He hasn't committed to her, and she's the one who expressed love first. He hasn't said he loves her, so maybe they're not in a monogamous, exclusive relationship. But he's keeping her in his life, and after meeting in person, they're planning future visits. She's in his room, they had sex, etc. Now he's conflicted because he's enjoying the relationship but doesn't want to commit and also wants to see other girls.\n\nThe key points here are honesty and consent. If he's not in a monogamous agreement, it's possible he's not in the wrong. But wait, he's keeping her while also looking for others. If he's not upfront with her about his intentions, that's a problem. However, the scenario doesn't mention him being dishonest. He's just trying to figure out his feelings and doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up yet.\n\nBut does pursuing other girls while in a relationship (even if it's long-distance) constitute cheating? That depends on the terms of the relationship. If it's non-exclusive, then maybe not. If it's supposed to be exclusive, then yes. The problem is he hasn't clarified this with her. He might be leading her on, making her believe there's a future together, while he's not committed to her and is open to seeing others. That could be emotionally manipulative.\n\nHe also mentions not wanting to break up with her because he doesn't want to hurt her. But by staying in the relationship while planning to see others, he's setting her up for potential heartbreak. It's self-serving. He's using the relationship to avoid hurting her feelings but is actually causing her more pain in the long run by not being honest about his intentions.\n\nSo, even if the relationship isn't exclusive, the lack of communication about his intentions and the potential for emotional harm might make him the asshole. He's not being fully transparent, and his actions could lead to her suffering later when she finds out he's seeing others. The fact that he's prioritizing his own needs without considering her well-being is a red flag.\n"
