I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the long post is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls.\n\nFirst, the author is in a long-distance relationship with a girl he met on Tinder. They haven't met until recently, and after a long time of intermittent contact, they met up, had a nice time, and she's very affectionate. The author feels his feelings are growing, but he's hesitant because he doesn't want to commit yet. He's also thinking about pursuing other girls to gain experience for future relationships, but he doesn't want to cheat.\n\nThe key points here are: the relationship is long-distance, the author hasn't been entirely honest about his intentions (he didn't commit feelings when she said she loves him), and now he's considering other relationships while still in this one. \n\nIn most relationships, especially when one partner is in a long-distance and has strong feelings, exclusivity is expected. If the author is pursuing other girls while still in a committed relationship with this girl, even if it's not a formal commitment, he's being dishonest. The girl believes they're in a meaningful relationship, and the author is keeping options open. That's not just about cheating, but about leading her on without clear boundaries.\n\nThe author mentions he doesn't want to hurt her by breaking up, but by continuing the relationship without honesty, he's causing potential emotional harm. The fact that he's planning to be with her again and then pursue others while she's invested makes this a case of emotional manipulation. Even if there's no physical cheating, the emotional commitment is being misrepresented. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's not being truthful about his intentions and is exploiting the relationship for personal gain rather than treating her with the respect she deserves. The answer should be A.\n"
