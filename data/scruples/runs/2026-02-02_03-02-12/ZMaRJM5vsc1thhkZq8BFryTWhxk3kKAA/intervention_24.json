I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for maintaining a long-distance relationship while also pursuing other girls. The author is 22 and has a specific situation where he's in a LDR with a girl he met on Tinder. They had a period where they were really close, then he pulled back because he was afraid of her getting too attached. Now, after reconnecting, he's feeling conflicted because his feelings are growing, but he still wants to explore other relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is in a relationship, even if it's long-distance. The main issue is whether it's wrong to pursue other girls while in that relationship. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nThe author mentions that he's not interested in a long-term future with this girl but enjoys the time they spend together. He's also concerned about hurting her if he breaks up now. However, he wants to explore other relationships, which implies he's not committed to monogamy. But in the context of a relationship, even a LDR, having expectations of exclusivity is common unless otherwise agreed.\n\nSo, the crux is about honesty and consent. The author hasn't mentioned discussing the terms of the relationship. If the girl believes it's exclusive and the author isn't honest about wanting to date others, that's a problem. The author's intention to pursue other girls while keeping this relationship suggests a lack of commitment, which could be deceitful if the girl expects monogamy.\n\nAdditionally, the author's fear of hurting her by breaking up might lead him to stay in a situation where he's not fully committed, which can be emotionally damaging to her. The author's reasoning that he wants to \"get experience\" for his future relationship might not justify current actions if it's leading to emotional harm.\n\nIn many relationships, exclusivity is a standard expectation unless both parties agree otherwise. Since the author hasn't clarified that they're in an open relationship, his actions could be considered a breach of trust. The girl's affection and plans to meet regularly suggest she sees this as a committed relationship. Therefore, the author's pursuit of other girls without her knowledge or consent could be seen as unethical or deceitful, making him at fault.\n"
