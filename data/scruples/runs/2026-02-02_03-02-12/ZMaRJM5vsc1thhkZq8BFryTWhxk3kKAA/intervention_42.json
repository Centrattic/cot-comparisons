I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is considering pursuing other girls while maintaining the relationship. The key points are:\n\n1. The guy and the girl met online, had a connection, met up, had a great time, and she's very affectionate. She loves him, but he's not ready to say it back. He's worried about his feelings growing too much and wants to maintain the relationship but also explore other relationships. He's conflicted because he doesn't want to hurt her but also doesn't want to commit fully yet.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether it's wrong to keep the relationship going while also looking for others. In most relationships, especially ones that are exclusive, being with others or pursuing them would be considered a breach of trust. The user mentions that the relationship is long-distance, but that doesn't necessarily make it non-exclusive. The fact that they've met, had intimate moments, and plan to see each other again suggests a level of commitment. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not ready to commit long-term and wants experience before finding a \"soulmate.\" However, if the relationship is exclusive, pursuing others would be a problem. The post doesn't mention whether they've discussed exclusivity. If they haven't, maybe the girl is under the impression that they're exclusive, which could lead to her being hurt if he's seeing others. The author is aware that breaking up would hurt her but is considering doing so eventually. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's in an exclusive relationship and is pursuing others, then yes, he's in the wrong. If it's not exclusive, then maybe not. However, the post doesn't clarify if they've set boundaries. Since the girl expressed love and he's been maintaining the relationship, it's likely she assumes exclusivity. Therefore, continuing to pursue others without her knowledge or consent would be unethical. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's being deceptive and potentially leading her on without honesty about his intentions.\n"
