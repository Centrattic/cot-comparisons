I am twenty two year old guy. I don't think I am an asshole or some douchebag. A year ago, I met this girl on tinder and we started talking for about two months or so, she became really attached to me, even though we've never met. That frightened me quite a lot because I didn't feel like I did anything worthy of such affection. Later on it all dwindled down because I starter to give her a cold shoulder because of my fear of her falling in love with me. I still haven't deleted her from snapchat and all that. Fast forward ten months, it's almost christmas time. I see her story saying she wants to talk to anyone (she did have a boyfriend somewhere in between those ten months, so I had thought she still has one). I decide to text and \" catch up\" on everything that's changed in her life... And we started talking for hours and days. She was still the same nice girls, still almost as affectionate as she was before. New years come around and she snapped me she loves me. I knew I couldn't say it back to her, so I didn't and explained as to why I couldn't say it back. She seemed content with it. We were planning on meeting sometime soon (she lives around 100miles away from me) so we sorted our schedules out and she bought a train ticket to visit me for three days.\nShe stayed in my shared house, in my room. Everything was absolutely wonderful and great. Sex was good, we had nice conversations and a lot of laughs. Couldn't ask for more, right?? Well. After she left, I thought to myself \"fuck, it's gonna suck not being near her\". Now I'd have to wait for a month or two to see her again. The biggest problem for me is that my feelings towards her have now grown even after we met and shared a lot of intimate moments. I fear it will only worsen as time goes on and we're apart during that time. She left my place this past sunday, so it's still fresh in my mind and I keep thinking about it and how it will, most likely, turn out. She's really into me and I feel so pressured. If I were to break up with her now, I would definitely hurt her really badly, but I don't want to break up with her. She's fun. She won't be my future soulmate, but I certainly enjoy being with her. \n\nI also am twenty two with this mentality towards girls and my relationships with them \"I want to get as much experience as I can so I don't fuck it all up with the one that's meant for me.\" meaning I should try and pursue other girls, but I really don't want to cheat, yet I feel like I will if I keep this up. Sorry this is such a rant.\n\nTl;dr am I the asshole for wanting to keep this girl with me while also pursuing other girls in my town? If I were to break up with her right now, I know I would ruin her and that's the last thing I want. Some time should pass and I want things to become less extreme. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is now considering pursuing other girls while keeping the relationship going. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author met a girl on Tinder a year ago, they had a long-distance relationship. She became very attached, and he started giving her the cold shoulder because he feared she was falling in love. They met up recently, had a good time, and she told him she loves him. He didn't reciprocate the love but explained why. They plan to meet again in a few months.\n\nNow, after the meeting, he's feeling more attached but still doesn't see her as a future partner. His reasoning is that he wants to gain experience before finding his \"soulmate.\" However, he's worried he might cheat if he continues. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to keep the relationship while pursuing others.\n\nThe main ethical issue here is about honesty and commitment. If the relationship is not exclusive, then maybe it's okay. But the problem is that the author hasn't actually discussed this with the girl. She's into him, and he's keeping her around while planning to be with others. That sounds like emotional manipulation or at least a lack of transparency. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I should check if that's the case. In many relationships, especially romantic ones, exclusivity is expected unless otherwise agreed. If the author is in a committed relationship, even if it's long-distance, pursuing others would be a breach of that commitment. However, the author hasn't explicitly stated that the relationship is monogamous. But the girl's statement \"she loves him\" and their planning to meet again suggests she might be seeing it as more serious.\n\nThe author's hesitation to say he loves her back and his fear of her falling in love could mean he's not fully committed. But if he's keeping her as a partner while also looking elsewhere, that's misleading. The author is using the girl for emotional and physical connection without being honest about his intentions. Even if it's not cheating yet, the intention to pursue others while maintaining the relationship is wrong because it's not genuine. The girl deserves to know if he's not looking to be exclusive or serious.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not being honest about his intentions and is leading the girl on, which is a form of emotional harm even if he's not physically cheating yet.\n"
