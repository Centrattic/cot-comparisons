I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The scenario involves a conflict between the dog owner and Karen from DxE.\n\nFirst, the dog owner bought a purebred dog from a breeder. Karen approached them during a protest, started a conversation, and then accused the owner of unethical practices related to dog breeding. The conversation escalated, Karen grabbed the leash, pushed the owner, and tried to take the dog. The owner then reported her to the police, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nThe key points here are the actions of both parties. Karen's behavior seems aggressive and inappropriate. She approached the owner, got into an argument, and physically assaulted them. The owner, on the other hand, tried to walk away and only reported the incident after being attacked. The police were involved, and Karen's actions led to her arrest.\n\nThe user is asking if the dog owner is at fault. From a legal standpoint, if someone physically assaults another person, the victim is within their rights to report it. The owner didn't provoke the attack; they were defending themselves and their dog. The fact that Karen was part of a protest doesn't negate the illegality of assault. The owner's actions in reporting the incident seem justified.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the initial confrontation started from a disagreement about dog breeding, which is a sensitive topic. But the escalation into physical violence is where Karen's actions cross into criminal behavior. The owner's decision to report her is a response to an assault, not the initial argument.\n\nAlso, the owner mentions feeling bad about affecting the protest's permit, showing they are aware of free speech issues. But the police revoked the permit specifically because Karen was part of the protest, not the whole group. The owner didn't target the entire protest, just the individual who committed the assault.\n\nIn conclusion, the owner acted in self-defense and reported a crime. They are not at fault for the arrest resulting from Karen's actions. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
