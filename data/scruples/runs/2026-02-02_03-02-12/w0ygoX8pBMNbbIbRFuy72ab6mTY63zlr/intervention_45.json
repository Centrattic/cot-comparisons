I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist after an altercation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman was walking her dog in a neighborhood with health-conscious people. She encountered a protestor from DxE, a known vegan activist group. The activist, Karen, started a conversation about the dog's breed and then made a comment about dogs in shelters being gassed. The author explained they used a breeder, which Karen seemed to take as selfish. The conversation escalated, Karen grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author got a neighbor to help and reported the incident to the police, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author acted appropriately. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. Let me consider the legal aspects. If Karen physically assaulted the author by grabbing the leash and pushing her, that's a criminal offense, like assault or battery. The author reporting that would likely be justified, especially since there was a witness (the neighbor) to corroborate the story. The police arresting Karen suggests they found the incident credible. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance in the context. The activist was part of a protest, which is protected under free speech. The author mentions feeling bad that the protest permit was revoked because of Karen's actions. But if Karen's actions were outside the bounds of peaceful protest\u2014like engaging in physical violence\u2014it's her fault for escalating the situation. The author's self-defense in protecting their dog and person would be valid. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't provoke the confrontation initially. Karen was the one approaching and then escalating. The author tried to walk away but Karen kept pushing. The act of grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog is a clear trespass on the owner's rights. Legally, the author had a right to defend themselves and their property (the dog). \n\nThe user's dilemma is whether they overstepped by reporting Karen. But in the US, if someone commits an assault, you're expected to report it. The police did arrest Karen, which validates the report. The fact that Karen was part of a protest doesn't make her immune to criminal charges for violence. The author didn't start the conflict and acted within the law to protect themselves. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author shouldn't have reported her because it's a political issue. But the law doesn't distinguish between types of crimes based on the person's affiliations. Also, the author's actions led to a felony charge for Karen, but if the police agree that a felony was committed, then the author isn't at fault for following the law. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were in self-defense and reporting a crime. They aren't in the wrong for doing what's legally appropriate when someone physically attacks them during a confrontation.\n"
