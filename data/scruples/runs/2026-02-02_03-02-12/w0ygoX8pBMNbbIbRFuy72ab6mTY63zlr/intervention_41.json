I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for reporting the vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman (Karen) from the DxE protest approached them. The woman asked about the dog, and when told it was a purebred, she made a comment about shelter dogs. The author explained they used a reputable breeder. Then Karen started calling the author names, grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author called the police, the woman was arrested, and the protest's permit was revoked. The author now has a court date and is facing charges because the woman might be charged with a felony. The author is torn, feeling bad about the other protesters who were peaceful, but justified the report due to the assault.\n\nSo the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by reporting the woman after an assault? The woman's actions included grabbing the leash, pushing the author, and trying to take the dog. Physical aggression is a criminal act in most places. The author acted to protect their dog and themselves, and reported the incident. The police arrested the woman, which suggests they saw a crime. The author might be facing charges because the woman could be retaliating, perhaps with a false accusation.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. Legally, if the woman committed an assault or attempted theft (taking the dog), then reporting her is correct. The author didn't provoke the situation, even though the conversation started with a question. The author tried to walk away and de-escalate but was attacked. The other protesters were not involved, so the author's action targeted the aggressor specifically.\n\nHowever, there's a twist: the author is facing a felony charge themselves. This might be if the woman is accusing the author of something, or if the police initially thought there was an issue but now the case is against the author. The user mentions the author is facing a fifth-degree felony, which is a minor felony, but still. The author might be worried about being charged for reporting a crime. But unless the author lied to the police or provoked the woman, they might not be at fault. \n\nThe author's concern is whether they overreacted. But since the woman used physical force and tried to take the dog, it's a valid reason to report. The author didn't start the conflict. The fact that the woman was part of a protest doesn't make her actions excusable. The author's right to protect their property (the dog) and themselves should be protected.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They reported a criminal act and acted to protect their dog. The charges against them might be due to legal complications, but the initial reporting was justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
