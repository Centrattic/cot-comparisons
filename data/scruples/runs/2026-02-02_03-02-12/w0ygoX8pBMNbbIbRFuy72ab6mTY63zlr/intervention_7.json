I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where Karen, a protester from DxE, approached the person walking their dog. The interaction escalated when Karen grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The person reported Karen for assault when she pushed them and tried to take the dog. If Karen indeed physically assaulted them, that's a criminal act, and reporting it to the police is appropriate. The police arrested her, which suggests they found enough evidence to support the report. Legally, the person might be justified in reporting the incident, especially if there was an immediate threat or actual harm.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The person was in a public space, walking their dog. Karen's initial engagement started as a friendly conversation about the dog but then turned confrontational. The person tried to disengage but Karen persisted, leading to the physical altercation. The person's decision to report Karen could be seen as self-defense and protecting their pet. However, some might argue that the person could have de-escalated the situation differently, like moving away or ignoring the provocation. But given that Karen physically attacked them, the response seems reasonable.\n\nThe person also mentions feeling conflicted about reporting Karen because they respect free speech. However, the protesters were within their rights to protest, but individual actions (like assault) can't be protected under free speech. The police revoking the permit for that specific protestor makes sense if her actions were outside the scope of the protest.\n\nThe financial aspect mentioned (buying the dog for $2500) might influence the person's perspective but doesn't necessarily impact the rightness of reporting a crime. The felony charge against Karen is based on her actions, not the cost of the dog.\n\nConsidering all these points, the person's actions seem justified. They faced an immediate threat and acted to protect themselves and their pet. Reporting a crime when it occurs is a civic duty. The police's involvement and the subsequent arrest indicate that the report was valid. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
