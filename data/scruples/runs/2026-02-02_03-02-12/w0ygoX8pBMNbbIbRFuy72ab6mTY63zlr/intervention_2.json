I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person was walking their dog when a vegan activist approached them. The activist started talking about dogs being gassed in shelters and then accused them of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. Then things escalated when the activist grabbed the leash and tried to take the dog, leading to the person reporting her to the police, resulting in her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The key event here is the activist grabbing the leash and pushing the person. That seems like a physical assault or battery, which is a criminal offense. If that's true, then the person who was attacked is within their rights to report it. Legally, self-defense or protecting property (the dog) might also be a factor. The person didn't initiate the confrontation; the activist did. The police arrested her, which suggests they saw some criminal act.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author was defending their decision to buy from a breeder, which the activist was against. The author didn't engage in the activist's arguments but asked them to stop. The activist then escalated the situation. It's important to note that the author didn't provoke the altercation; they were trying to leave when the activist followed and then physically confronted them.\n\nAnother point is the protest itself. The author mentions that the other protesters were just doing their thing, and the author supports free speech. However, the specific activist in question crossed the line into physical confrontation. The author reported only the person who attacked them, which seems justified.\n\nBut maybe there's a gray area. Could the activist's actions be seen as part of their protest? However, using physical force to further a cause is not protected under free speech. The line between protest and assault is crossed when it involves violence. The author's response was to report the incident, which is the correct legal procedure.\n\nPotential ethical concerns: Did the author overreact? The author was in a public place, being followed and then attacked. The response was to involve the police, which is standard. The activist's actions were inappropriate and illegal, so reporting them isn't wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling torn about the arrest because they believe in free speech. However, the activist's actions went beyond peaceful protest. The author didn't interfere with the protest until the activist physically attacked them and their dog.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their rights to report a crime. The activist's actions were criminal, so the author isn't in the wrong for seeking justice.\n"
