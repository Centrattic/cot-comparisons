I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by reporting the vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was walking their dog when a protester from DxE, Karen, approached them. They had a conversation where Karen criticized the author for buying a purebred dog from a breeder, implying it's unethical because of shelter overpopulation. The author explained their reasoning, but Karen escalated, called names, grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author then reported her, and the police arrested her. Now the author is facing a court case where Karen might get a felony charge.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did Karen's actions cross the line into criminal behavior, and did the author act appropriately in reporting her? \n\nWhen someone physically assaults another, that's generally a criminal act. Grabbing the leash and pushing the person could be considered assault or battery. The author had the right to defend themselves and their property (the dog) and to report the incident. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit suggests they found Karen's actions unlawful, possibly indicating they interfered with a legal protest.\n\nThe author might feel conflicted because they support free speech but also had a legitimate reason to report a crime. However, the question is whether they were wrong. If Karen's actions were criminal, then reporting her was justified. The author didn't provoke the situation beyond the initial conversation, and Karen's escalation led to the conflict. The neighbor witnessed the incident, supporting the author's account.\n\nPotential issues: Was the author's response excessive? They didn't use violence themselves, just reported the incident. The police handled the arrest, so that's within their authority. The felony charge against Karen might be appropriate given the physical assault. The author could be worried about being a witness, but they're not necessarily in the wrong for reporting a crime.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong because Karen committed a crime, and the author acted within their rights to report it. The confusion might be thinking if they overreacted, but the physical attack justifies the response.\n"
