I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen, a DxE protestor.\n\nFirst, the author was walking their dog when Karen approached. Karen started by asking about the dog's breed, then brought up the issue of dogs in shelters. The author explained they used a breeder for specific traits. Karen then accused the author of being selfish, yelled, grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The police were called, Karen was arrested, and the protest permit was revoked. The author is now facing a felony charge as a result of reporting Karen.\n\nI need to analyze the actions of both parties. The key points are: Karen's aggressive behavior, grabbing the leash, pushing the author, and the subsequent arrest. The author's actions were to report the incident to the police when it was happening, which led to Karen's arrest. \n\nLegally, if someone commits an assault or tries to take someone else's pet, that's a criminal act. The author's act of reporting this is generally within their rights. However, there might be arguments about whether the author provoked the situation or if the police had enough grounds to revoke the protest permit. Also, the author mentions feeling torn about the other protestors' free speech, but the key issue here is Karen's individual actions.\n\nConsidering that Karen physically attacked and tried to take the dog, which is a serious crime, the author acting in self-defense and reporting it seems justified. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong here. However, there's a nuance if the police's response was excessive or if the author had prior issues with the protest. But based on the given info, the author's actions were in response to a violent incident. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
