I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was walking their dog and got into an argument with a vegan activist from DxE. The activist approached them, started talking about shelter dogs, then escalated by grabbing the dog's leash and trying to take the puppy. The author reported her, she got arrested, and now the author is facing a felony charge for reporting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality of the activist's actions. If she physically grabbed the leash and tried to take the dog, that's probably assault or some form of battery. The author had the right to protect their dog and themselves. The police arrested her, so they must have seen it as a criminal act. Reporting a crime is a citizen's duty, so the author isn't wrong for calling the police when someone is committing an assault.\n\nBut then there's the part about the DxE protest. The author mentions that other protesters were just doing their thing. Did the activist's actions fall under protected free speech, or was she committing a crime? If she was engaged in a legal protest but then committed an individual act of violence, that's separate from the protest itself. The author didn't target the group, just the person who attacked them.\n\nThe author might feel some guilt because they're worried about someone facing jail time. However, if the activist's actions were criminal, then the author did the right thing by reporting. The fact that the police arrested her shows they agreed. The author's dog is their property, and they have the right to defend it. The activist's argument about dog breeding is a separate issue; even if the author's choice to use a breeder is debatable, that doesn't justify violence.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they tried to walk away and were just being assertive about not wanting to discuss their dog. The activist's escalation to physical confrontation makes her responsible for her actions. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves and their pet. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
