I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The scenario involves a confrontation between the user and Karen, a protestor from DxE. The user is facing a felony charge now because they reported Karen, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The user was walking their dog, and Karen approached them. The conversation starts with a friendly question about the dog. Then Karen brings up the issue about shelter dogs, which leads to an argument. Karen then accuses the user of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder and becomes aggressive, grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog. The user and their neighbor then report Karen, leading to her arrest.\n\nKey points here: The initial interaction seems to be Karen initiating the conversation. The user was uncomfortable but tried to walk away. Karen escalated the situation by following, yelling, using derogatory language, and physically grabbing the dog's leash. The police were called, and Karen was arrested. The user is now facing legal consequences, possibly due to the charges filed against them. \n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. From the description, it seems Karen's actions were the catalyst for the conflict. She became aggressive and physically confrontational. The user tried to de-escalate by walking away but was followed. The user then reported the incident, which led to Karen's arrest. However, the user is now facing a felony charge, which might be related to the incident, perhaps for not letting Karen leave or for not handling the situation differently. \n\nBut wait, in the original scenario, the user reports Karen, leading to her arrest. The police revoked the protest permit for DxE because Karen was part of them, which might imply that the protest was legitimate, but Karen's actions were individual. The user might have overstepped by involving the police, especially if Karen's actions, while aggressive, were part of a protected protest. However, Karen's physical assault (grabbing the leash, pushing the user) could be considered a crime, making the user justified in reporting it. \n\nBut the user is now facing a felony charge. Why? Maybe the user retaliated physically when Karen tried to grab the dog, leading to a charge of assault or something similar. The user mentions that the dog wanted to come to them, implying the dog didn't resist, but perhaps the user used force when reclaiming the leash. If the user pushed back or used excessive force, they could be in the wrong. However, the user states they were able to take back the leash and their neighbor helped. It's possible the user didn't use force, but the police might still have found grounds to charge them, perhaps for disorderly conduct or something related to the protest.\n\nAnother angle: the user's decision to report Karen. If Karen was engaged in a legal protest, even if her actions were inappropriate, the user's reporting her might be seen as targeting her rather than the group, which could be acceptable. However, if the police determined that Karen's actions were not criminal (e.g., harassment), the user might be overreacting. But since Karen physically attacked, the user's report was justified.\n\nThe user is worried about the other protestors losing their permit because of Karen. The user feels conflicted about this, which shows they considered free speech. However, the user's actions directly led to the permit being revoked. This could be a point against them if the protest was otherwise legal, and the user's report was a misuse of police resources.\n\nBut legally, if Karen committed a crime (assault), then the user is correct in reporting her. The user might be facing charges if the police found they also committed a crime during the incident. If the user was just the victim, they shouldn't be charged. However, the user mentions facing a felony charge, which complicates things. Maybe there was a misunderstanding, or the user used force in self-defense that was deemed excessive.\n\nIn summary, Karen's actions were the initial problem. She escalated the situation with verbal abuse and physical aggression. The user's reporting her seems justified. However, the user's current legal trouble might stem from their own actions during the confrontation, which could mean they are partially at fault. But without more details on the charges, it's hard to say. If the user is being charged because they reported a legitimate crime, then they're not at fault. If they are being charged for their own actions during the incident, then maybe they are. Given the information, the user acted to protect themselves and their dog from an aggressive person, so likely not in the wrong.\n"
