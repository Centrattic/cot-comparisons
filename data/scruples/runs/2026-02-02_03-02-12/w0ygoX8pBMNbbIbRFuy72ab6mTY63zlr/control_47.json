I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where the activist, Karen, approached the dog owner and escalated into a physical altercation where Karen tried to take the dog's leash and pushed the owner. The owner reported her, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts as presented. The owner was walking their dog, which they bought from a breeder. Karen approached, discussed dog breeding, and then escalated to aggressive behavior. The owner claims self-defense by holding onto the leash and getting help from a neighbor. They reported the incident to the police, leading to Karen's arrest. The owner is now facing charges, possibly for the report leading to Karen's felony charges.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: If Karen physically assaulted the owner by pushing and trying to take the dog, the owner has a right to report that. However, there's a nuance here. The owner's initial interaction started with Karen questioning their choice of breeder, which could be seen as provocative, but the owner had the right to defend themselves. The key point is whether the owner's report was justified based on Karen's actions. If Karen's actions constituted assault, then reporting her is appropriate. But if the owner's report was an overreaction or based on their own biases (like breeder vs. shelter), then they might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the owner mentions feeling torn because they believed in free speech but reported Karen. However, free speech doesn't protect against illegal actions. If Karen committed assault, then the owner is justified in reporting her. The fact that Karen was part of a protest group adds another layer, but the individual's actions (assault) are separate from the protest's legality.\n\nPotential issues here: Did the owner provoke the situation by engaging in the conversation? The owner initially answered Karen's questions, then set a boundary by saying it's none of her business. Karen then escalated physically. The owner's response to protect their dog and themselves seems reasonable.\n\nAnother angle: The owner is facing charges now. Maybe they were charged for something related to the incident, like provoking the altercation or false reporting. The original question is about the owner's responsibility in reporting Karen. If the police found Karen guilty of assault, then the owner did the right thing. If the charges against Karen are based on a misunderstanding or the owner's false report, then the owner is in the wrong.\n\nBut according to the user's summary, Karen was arrested and the owner got a court date. The police revoked the protest permit for DxE because of Karen's actions, which suggests that the police found her actions illegal. If the court later upholds that Karen was guilty of assault, then the owner is not in the wrong. However, if the court finds that the owner provoked the situation or falsified the report, then the owner could be at fault.\n\nIn conclusion, the owner's actions depend on the factual accuracy of their report. If they accurately reported an assault, they're justified. If they exaggerated or reported without valid reason, they are wrong. Based on the description, the owner seems to have been defending against an assault, so they might not be in the wrong. However, if the court finds otherwise, that's a different matter. The answer hinges on the legal determination of the incident's facts.\n"
