I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is at fault. The situation involves a confrontation between the person and an activist from DxE. \n\nFirst, the activist approached the person while they were walking their dog. The activist then accused the person of getting a purebred dog from a breeder, implying that buying from a breeder is unethical because of shelter dogs. The conversation escalated when the activist grabbed the dog's leash and tried to take the dog. The person called the police, and the activist was arrested. Now, the person is facing a felony charge and is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the person do something wrong by reporting the activist? Let's break down the key points. \n\nThe activist's actions: She grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the person. That sounds like assault or attempted theft. The person had a right to protect their property (their dog) and themselves. When someone tries to take your dog by force, calling the police is reasonable. \n\nThe person's actions: They were walking their dog, engaged in a conversation, and when confronted with aggression, they defended themselves. They didn't provoke the situation initially. The activist was the one who escalated it by grabbing the leash. The person's response was to report the incident, which is a standard procedure. \n\nPossible issues: Did the person overreact? The activist was part of a protest group, but if she was acting outside of the protest's scope by trying to take the dog, that's a separate issue. Also, the person reported her, leading to an arrest. However, if the activist committed a crime (assault, attempted theft), then reporting is appropriate. \n\nThe person might argue that they were defending their property and person. The activist's actions could be seen as violent, which justifies calling the police. The fact that the police revoked the protestor's permit suggests that the activist's actions were not part of a legitimate protest but an individual act of aggression. \n\nThe user's own thoughts say they think the author isn't in the wrong. The user is curious if others agree. The answer should be B (No) because the person acted within their rights to protect themselves and their property. The activist's actions were likely criminal, so reporting her was justified. The person isn't at fault here.\n"
