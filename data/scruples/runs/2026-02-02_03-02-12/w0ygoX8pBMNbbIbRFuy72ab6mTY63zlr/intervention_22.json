I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict between a dog owner and a protester.\n\nFirst, the key points: The woman was part of a protest group (DxE), approached the owner while walking her dog, and escalated into a confrontation where she grabbed the leash, pushed the owner, and tried to take the dog. The owner then reported her, leading to her arrest and possible felony charges. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider the legality and ethics here. The main action is the woman's attempt to take the dog, which is a clear assault and possibly theft. The owner had a right to defend their dog and themselves. Reporting the incident to the police was appropriate because a crime was committed. The owner didn't provoke the altercation beyond being asked to leave alone. They also mentioned that other protesters were peaceful, so it's not a generalization against the group. The author's intention was to report the specific act of aggression, not the protest itself. \n\nFelony charges for grabbing a leash and trying to take a dog might be a bit harsh, but if the police determined it involved assault or attempted theft, then it's within their jurisdiction. The owner's action of reporting was a responsible response to protect themselves and their pet. The ethical aspect is about self-defense and not letting the protest interfere with their right to own a dog. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The activist's actions crossed the line into criminal behavior. Answer B.\n"
