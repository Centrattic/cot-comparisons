I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a dog owner who bought a purebred Golden Retriever from a breeder. While walking the dog, they encountered a vegan activist (Karen) protesting for DxE. The activist approached the author, made comments about shelter dogs being gassed, and then got confrontational when the author explained they used a reputable breeder. The activist then allegedly grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author reported this, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author claims that Karen physically assaulted them by grabbing the leash and pushing them. If that's true, then the author reporting the incident to the police was a legitimate response to an assault. Assault is a criminal act, so reporting it isn't inherently wrong. However, the context is that Karen was part of a protest. The author mentions that they felt bad about the protest permit being revoked because the other protesters were peacefully demonstrating. The author also expresses some doubt about Karen's deserved punishment, indicating they might have hesitations.\n\nBut from the author's account, the incident happened quickly, and they had a neighbor as a witness. The police were involved, and Karen's actions were aggressive. The author didn't start the confrontation; they were responding to Karen's escalating behavior. The author's main intention was to protect their dog and themselves from an attack. Even though the author might feel conflicted about the outcome (like the permit revocation affecting the protest), their immediate action was in self-defense and to report a crime.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted or that the protest's context should have been considered more. However, the story details that Karen initiated the confrontation by following the author, making personal attacks, and then physically engaging. The author's actions in reporting a crime that occurred during a protest don't seem wrong, especially since they were a victim. The author also mentions they care about the protest's free speech aspect, which suggests they aren't against the cause but against the individual's violent actions.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong because they reported a crime that was committed against them. The decision to report an assault is justified regardless of the context of the protest, as the criminal act is separate from the protest itself.\n"
