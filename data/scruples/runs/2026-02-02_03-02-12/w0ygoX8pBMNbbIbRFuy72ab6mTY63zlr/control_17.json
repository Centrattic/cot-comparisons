I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a dog owner who reported a vegan activist after an altercation. The key points here are the interaction between the two individuals and the subsequent police involvement.\n\nFirst, the woman from DxE (Direct Action Everywhere) approached the dog owner and started a conversation. She then made a comment about dogs being gassed in shelters, which the owner knew but explained their breeder choice. When the owner wanted to leave, the activist followed, called her names, and physically grabbed the dog's leash, leading to a struggle. The owner reported the incident, leading to the activist's arrest.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The activist's actions escalated to physical contact by grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog. That's a clear physical aggression, which is illegal. The owner tried to walk away and de-escalate but was followed and harassed. The police were called, and the activist was arrested for assault, which seems justified given the physical contact.\n\nHowever, the owner did report her, leading to a felony charge. The question is whether the owner overreacted or if the activist's actions warranted the police response. The owner had a witness (the neighbor) who saw the incident. So, from a legal standpoint, the owner had a right to defend their property and seek help when physically attacked. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the initial conversation was a peaceful protest, and the owner's reaction was excessive. But since the activist crossed into physical aggression, the owner's reporting her isn't necessarily wrong. The owner didn't initiate the conflict; they were defending against an attack. The felony charge might be severe, but the action of reporting seems justified given the assault.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the activist's actions escalated into assault, and the owner acted within legal bounds to protect themselves and their pet.\n"
