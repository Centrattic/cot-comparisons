I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. The situation involves a confrontation at a protest where Karen from DxE approached the dog owner, got aggressive, grabbed the leash, and was then arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The dog owner was walking their dog, and a protester approached them. There was an exchange where Karen accused the owner of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. The owner tried to leave but Karen followed, got upset, used name-calling, grabbed the leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The owner then reported the incident, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nThe key points here are whether the owner's actions were justified. When someone is physically assaulted or threatened, even if the initial interaction was verbal, it's important to assess if the police response was appropriate. Karen's actions of grabbing the leash and pushing the owner could be considered assault or theft (attempted), which are criminal acts. The owner reporting the incident to protect themselves and their dog seems reasonable.\n\nThe owner also mentions they felt bad because other protesters were not involved. They believed in free speech but acted when there was a direct threat. The question is about right and wrong in reporting the activist. From a legal standpoint, if someone commits a crime, the victim reporting them is not wrong. The owner didn't escalate the situation beyond what was necessary; they sought help after being physically attacked.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. The owner might have provoked Karen by being defensive or dismissive. But in the story, the owner seems to have been trying to de-escalate by walking away and only became firm when Karen was aggressive. The push and attempt to take the dog are clear physical actions that justify calling the police.\n\nAlso, the owner is facing a court date and mentions the potential charges against Karen. If the police arrested her and the case is going to court, it implies that the authorities found the incident serious enough. The owner's own words indicate they were scared but acted to protect their dog and themselves. \n\nConsidering all that, the owner's decision to report Karen seems justified. They didn't instigate the confrontation beyond the initial exchange and faced a physical threat. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
