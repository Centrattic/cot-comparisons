I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman from DxE (a group known for animal rights activism) approached them. The woman started a conversation about dog breeding, then escalated into an argument where she physically grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the author. The author reported her, leading to her arrest. The author is now facing a court case, possibly as part of a mutual accusation.\n\nThe key points here are the actions of both parties. The woman allegedly initiated a confrontation, made accusatory remarks, and used physical force. The author reported the incident to the police, who arrested the woman. The author seems to feel conflicted because they respect free speech but believe the woman's actions crossed a line into violence.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the woman did physically assault the author or commit a crime by grabbing the dog's leash (which is the author's property), then the author was within their rights to report it. However, if the author's report was malicious or if there was no actual crime, then they might be at fault. \n\nIn this case, the woman's actions\u2014grabbing the leash and pushing the author\u2014could constitute assault or battery, which are criminal offenses. The author witnessed this and sought police intervention, which is a standard response to an assault. The author didn't provoke the altercation beyond the initial conversation, and the woman escalated it. \n\nIt's also important to consider the context of the protest. DxE is a group that uses direct action, sometimes controversial, but the woman's individual actions here were outside of the protest itself. The author didn't attack the group, just the specific individual who physically assaulted them. \n\nThe author might feel guilty because they contributed to the woman's arrest, but if the woman's actions were criminal, the author isn't at fault for reporting it. The possible felony charge against the author could be if there's a counter-accusation, but the narrative doesn't mention that. The user is facing a court date, which might involve some legal repercussions, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're in the wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their rights to report a physical altercation. The woman's actions were the catalyst. Unless there's evidence that the author provoked the situation or lied to the police, they aren't in the wrong here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
