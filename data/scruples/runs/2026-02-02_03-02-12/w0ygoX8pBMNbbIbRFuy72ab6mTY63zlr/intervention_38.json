I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group (DxE) confronted them. The woman asked about the dog's breed, then criticized the author for buying from a breeder instead of adopting. The conversation escalated, the woman grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, tried to take the dog, and used abusive language. The author reported the incident, leading to the woman's arrest.\n\nThe key points here are the actions of both parties. The author was defending their dog from being taken by force. The woman's actions included physical contact (pushing) and attempted theft of the dog. Even though the author had a different opinion on veganism, that's not the issue here. The issue is the physical altercation and attempted kidnapping of the dog. \n\nThe author reported the incident to the police, which is a standard response to such a situation. The police arrested the woman because she was engaged in illegal behavior. The author didn't provoke the confrontation beyond the initial exchange about the dog's breed. The woman's actions were aggressive and illegal, regardless of her beliefs. \n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: In many places, assault (pushing) and attempted theft (trying to take someone's dog) are criminal offenses. The author had the right to report these actions. The woman's involvement in a protest doesn't protect her from criminal charges if she committed a crime. The author didn't engage in any illegal activity themselves; they were the victim of an attack. \n\nThe author might feel conflicted because the protestors were exercising their right to free speech, but the woman's actions went beyond peaceful protest. The author's intent was to protect their dog and seek justice for the assault, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the incident. The woman committed a crime, and the author acted within their rights to report it. The answer should be B.\n"
