I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a conflict with a vegan activist, leading to the woman being arrested. The author reports Karen to the police after an altercation where Karen grabs the dog's leash and pushes them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author was walking their dog, had a conversation with Karen, who then escalated the situation by grabbing the leash and pushing them. The author and a neighbor intervened, leading to Karen's arrest. The police revoked the protest permit because of this incident. The author is now facing a felony charge as a result.\n\nThe key points to analyze here are: Did the author have a right to report Karen? Was Karen's action a crime? The author's actions were in self-defense when the leash was grabbed and they were pushed. The police's decision to revoke the permit suggests they saw Karen's actions as criminal. The author didn't provoke the situation; they were trying to leave and Karen escalated it. Also, the author's intent was to report the assault, which is a legal right. Since Karen's actions were aggressive and involved physical contact, the author acting within their rights by reporting her. The neighbor's testimony supports the author's account. The author's knowledge of dog breeding isn't the issue here; the main issue is the physical confrontation. The fact that Karen was part of a protest doesn't absolve her of assault. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime.\n"
