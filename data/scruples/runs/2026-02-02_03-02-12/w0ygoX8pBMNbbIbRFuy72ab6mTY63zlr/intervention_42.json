I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting the vegan activist, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group approached. The conversation started with a compliment, then shifted to a discussion about dog breeding. The activist accused the author of being selfish for using a breeder instead of adopting. The author tried to leave, but the activist grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The author then reported the incident to the police, leading to the activist's arrest.\n\nNow, considering the laws involved. In many places, assault or battery would be criminal offenses. If Karen pushed the author and tried to take the dog, that could be considered assault. However, the question is whether the author's actions in reporting her were wrong. \n\nThe author didn't provoke the situation initially. They were walking their dog and were approached. The activist's actions escalated the situation by following, yelling, and then physically grabbing the leash and pushing. The author acted in self-defense and with the help of a neighbor, which seems reasonable. Reporting the incident to the police after an assault is not inherently wrong. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The activist might have been acting on strong beliefs, but using physical force is crossing a line. The author's response was to report the incident, which is a legal right. The police then decided to arrest Karen based on the report. \n\nPotential issues could be if the author exaggerated the incident, but from the description, it seems the author gave a factual account. The author also mentions feeling torn about the arrest, showing they considered the activist's free speech, but the police revoked the permit specifically for Karen because of her actions, not the entire group. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author acted within their rights to report an assault. The activist's actions led to her own arrest, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
