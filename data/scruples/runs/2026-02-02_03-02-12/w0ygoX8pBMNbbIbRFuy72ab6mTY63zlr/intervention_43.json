I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that the author was walking their dog when a protester from DxE approached them. The protester started talking about how purebred dogs are bad because they contribute to shelter overpopulation. The author explained they used a breeder for specific traits, but the protester then called them names, tried to grab the dog's leash, and ended up getting arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the laws involved. The police arrested Karen for assault or disorderly conduct? If she physically grabbed the leash and tried to take the dog, that's probably assault or battery. The author reported the incident, which led to Karen's arrest. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nThe author didn't provoke the situation initially. They were just walking their dog. When Karen started following them, making personal attacks, and then physically interfering, the author had the right to defend themselves. Reporting the incident to the police seems reasonable because there was a physical altercation. The police were called, and Karen was arrested. The author didn't go out of their way to cause trouble; they were reacting to an aggressive act.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they felt bad about the protest being shut down, showing they respect free speech. The other protesters weren't involved, only Karen acted out. The author didn't target the protest, just responded to an individual who crossed a line.\n\nNow, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe letting the police handle it without calling for the arrest? But Karen's actions were threatening and involved physical contact, which is a crime. The author's right to protect their property (the dog) and themselves is valid. The police made the arrest, so they must have determined there was a crime. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. The outcome of the court case isn't the issue here; the question is about the rightness of the action.\n\nSo, based on the facts given, the author acted within their rights. The answer is B.\n"
