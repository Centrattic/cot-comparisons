I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and Karen, a protestor from DxE.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was walking their dog when Karen approached and started a conversation. Karen made a comment about purebred dogs and shelters, leading to an argument. Karen then allegedly grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author called the police, and Karen was arrested. The author is now facing a felony charge for reporting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did Karen's actions cross a legal line? The author says that Karen grabbed the leash and pushed them. That sounds like assault, which is a criminal offense. If that's true, then the author acted correctly by reporting it. On the other hand, if Karen was just protesting and the author escalated the situation by calling the police, maybe the author is at fault.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they were being followed by Karen after trying to walk away. Karen's actions of grabbing the leash and pushing could be considered assault, especially if there was no consent. The police arrested Karen, which suggests they saw some wrongdoing. The neighbor witnessed the incident, which supports the author's side.\n\nHowever, there's a possible nuance here. The author was in a public space where protests are allowed. If Karen was part of a legal protest, maybe her confrontation was part of her right to free speech. But when she crossed into physical interaction, that's different. The author might be justified in protecting themselves and their dog.\n\nThe author also mentions feeling torn about the arrest affecting the other protestors. But since Karen's actions were separate from the protest (she was physically aggressive), the author might not be at fault for reporting only her.\n\nAnother angle: the author's initial interaction was a conversation. Karen's aggressive behavior led to the conflict. The author didn't instigate the violence but acted in self-defense. Reporting a crime (assault) is a civic duty, so the author isn't in the wrong for doing that.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author overreacted by calling the police, but given the physical assault, it's reasonable. Also, the author mentions \"slaving\" their puppy, which could imply defensive reactions, but that's part of the confrontation.\n\nIn conclusion, since Karen allegedly committed a physical assault, the author was right to report her. The felony charge against Karen seems warranted based on the police's decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
