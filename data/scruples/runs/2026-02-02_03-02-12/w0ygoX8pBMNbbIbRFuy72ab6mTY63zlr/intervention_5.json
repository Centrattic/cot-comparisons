I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation between the author and a protestor from DxE. The key points here are the actions of both parties and whether the author's response was justified.\n\nFirst, the author was walking their dog when they were approached by Karen. The conversation started innocently about the dog's breed. Then Karen brought up the issue of purebred dogs and shelters, which the author acknowledged but explained their reasoning for choosing a breeder. The author tried to leave, but Karen escalated the situation by following them, calling them names, grabbing the leash, and pushing them. The author then reported this to the police, leading to Karen's arrest.\n\nThe author's main defense is that Karen physically assaulted them and tried to take their dog. The police arrested Karen, suggesting that the action was justified. The author also mentions that they felt bad about disrupting the protest, indicating they weren't targeting the other activists but only Karen's actions. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Legally, if Karen used force (grabbing the leash, pushing), the author had a right to self-defense and reporting the incident. The author didn't provoke the confrontation beyond the initial interaction. They tried to leave but were pursued. The police's decision to revoke the permit shows they saw Karen's actions as a violation of the protest rules.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overreacted by involving the police, but given the physical assault and the neighbor's testimony, it seems the police concurred. The author's report was based on a legitimate assault, not just ideological disagreement. The fact that Karen was part of a protest doesn't excuse her actions, and the author's defense of their property (the dog) and personal safety is valid.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author's actions seem justified. They didn't start the conflict, tried to de-escalate, and only sought help when physically attacked. The outcome by the police supports that. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
