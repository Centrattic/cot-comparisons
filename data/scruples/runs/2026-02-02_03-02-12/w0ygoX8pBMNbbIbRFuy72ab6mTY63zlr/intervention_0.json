I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who reported the vegan activist to the police is in the wrong. The situation involves a confrontation where the activist, Karen, approached the dog owner, got aggressive, and tried to take the dog. The owner reported the incident, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The owner was walking their dog in a public area. Karen approached them, had a conversation, and then escalated into a physical altercation where Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the owner. The owner then reported the incident to the police, who arrested Karen. The key points here are whether Karen's actions constituted assault or trespassing, and whether the owner's reporting was justified.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if Karen physically attacked or attempted to take the dog, that's a criminal act. The owner has the right to protect their property (the dog) and themselves. Reporting the incident to the police is a standard response to such an act, especially when there's a threat or actual physical contact involved.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the protest. The user mentions that Karen was part of a protest group (DxE) and that the police revoked their permit. It's important to note that free speech protections apply, but that doesn't extend to unlawful behavior during a protest. If Karen was engaging in non-violent protest, the owner's actions might be different. But since Karen's actions were aggressive and invasive, the owner reporting her isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThere's a potential issue if the owner provoked Karen or if there was prior escalation. But according to the account, the owner was just walking the dog, answered a question, and Karen escalated the situation. The neighbor witnessed the incident, supporting the owner's version.\n\nThe user is concerned about the felony charge, which is a fifth-degree felony, leading to possible prison time and fines. The user might be questioning the severity of the charges, but if Karen did physically attack someone, that's a valid criminal charge. The owner's role was to report what happened, and the legal system would determine the appropriate charges.\n\nIn summary, the owner acted in self-defense and protected their property when Karen became aggressive. Reporting the incident is a responsible action. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
