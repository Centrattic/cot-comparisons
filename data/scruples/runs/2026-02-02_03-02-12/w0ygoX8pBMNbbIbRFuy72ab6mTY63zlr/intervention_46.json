I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group, DxE, approached them. The woman started talking about dog shelters and then escalated to calling the author selfish and grabbing the dog's leash, causing a physical struggle. The author reported the incident, leading to the woman's arrest.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the woman commit a crime? The author claims she was grabbed, pushed, and the leash was taken. The police arrested her, which suggests they saw it as a criminal act. The author didn't provoke the situation; they were just walking their dog when the woman approached. The author tried to leave but was followed, then the woman escalated the situation physically. \n\nIn terms of the law, assault or battery could be involved if the woman used force without consent. The author had a right to report the crime. The woman's actions were aggressive and possibly criminal. The author's intention was to report a crime, not to target the vegan activist. They also mention feeling conflicted about free speech but clarify that they didn't report the entire protest, just the individual who attacked them. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the woman was just passionate and not violent. But the physical act of grabbing the leash and pushing is a clear act of assault. Also, the author didn't instigate the conflict. The woman approached first. \n\nSo, the author acted within their rights to report a crime. Therefore, the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
