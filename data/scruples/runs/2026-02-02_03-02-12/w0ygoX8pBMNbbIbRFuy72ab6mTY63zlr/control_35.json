I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for reporting a vegan activist who got arrested. The situation involves a protest where Karen, part of DxE, confronted the dog owner. There was an argument, Karen grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the person, and then the police were called.\n\nFirst, the key points: Did the author do something wrong by reporting Karen? Let's break it down. When Karen approached, it started as a conversation. Then she made a comment about shelter dogs, which the author didn't agree with. Karen escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing the person. The author and a neighbor intervened, leading to the police being called.\n\nThe author mentions that Karen was part of a protest group, but she didn't have a sign. The author didn't know she was a protestor initially. The confrontation became physical, and Karen's actions were aggressive enough to warrant a police report. The author is concerned about possibly causing Karen to face a felony charge, which is a serious matter.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects. If Karen physically assaulted the person by pushing them and trying to take the dog, that's a criminal act. Reporting her to the police was a responsible action to ensure her safety and seek justice. The police arrested Karen based on the incident, so the author is not in the wrong for reporting a crime that occurred.\n\nHowever, the author might question if they misinterpreted Karen's intent. But since Karen's actions were aggressive and involved physical contact, the police's decision to arrest her would be based on that incident. The author's actions were in self-defense and protection of their dog, so they're not at fault here. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
