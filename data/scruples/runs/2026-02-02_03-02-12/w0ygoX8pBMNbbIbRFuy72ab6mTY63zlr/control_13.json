I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the story is that the person was walking their dog when a protester from DxE approached them. The protester started talking about dogs being gassed in shelters, then accused them of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. The conversation escalated, the protester grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to the protester's arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation step by step. The key points here are the actions of both parties. The author was in a public space, walking their dog. The protester engaged in a conversation that turned confrontational. The protester's actions of grabbing the leash and pushing the author are physical aggression, which is a crime. The author then called the police, which led to the arrest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The author claims they were just walking their dog and defending themselves when the protester became aggressive. The police arrested the protester, so they must have found some wrongdoing on her part. The author might be worried about the legal consequences of reporting her, but according to the scenario, the police handled it, and the arrest was made.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The protester was part of a protest, which is generally protected free speech. But individual acts of aggression during a protest are separate from the protest itself. The author isn't necessarily responsible for the protester's actions unless they provoked her. The interaction started when the protester approached the author, asked about the dog, and then escalated the conversation. The author tried to leave but was followed. When confronted with the protester's accusations, the author stood their ground. The physical assault by the protester was the trigger for the police involvement.\n\nThe author's decision to report the incident seems justified because the protester committed a physical assault. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit for that individual (if that's what happened) is a separate matter. The author might feel conflicted about the outcome, especially if they respect the protest's message, but the act of reporting a crime is generally not wrong. The author is facing legal consequences because they were involved in a criminal case as the victim, not because they did something wrong themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a question about whether the author should have handled it differently, like trying to de-escalate the situation before calling the police. But given the physical attack, calling the police is a reasonable response. The author didn't initiate the confrontation and was defending themselves and their dog. The protester's actions were the catalyst here. The author's actions in reporting a crime are in line with societal expectations of law-abiding citizens.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't at fault for reporting a crime that was committed against them. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
