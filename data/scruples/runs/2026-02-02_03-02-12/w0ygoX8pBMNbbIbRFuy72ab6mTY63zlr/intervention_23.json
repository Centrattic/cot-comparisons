I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was walking their dog when a woman from a vegan protest group, DxE, approached them. The woman started talking about purebred dogs and then got aggressive, grabbing the dog's leash and trying to take the dog. The author reported her to the police, leading to her arrest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sequence of events. The woman approached the author, maybe started a conversation, and then escalated by grabbing the leash. The author says that the woman pushed them and tried to take the dog. The police arrested her, and now the author is facing legal consequences for reporting her. The question is whether the author did something wrong by reporting her.\n\nThe author's main defense is that they were defending themselves and their dog. If the woman physically assaulted them and tried to take the dog, then reporting her would be justified. The police arrested her, which suggests that the authorities found some wrongdoing on her part. Also, the author mentions that their neighbor witnessed the incident, which could support their side of the story.\n\nThe woman's actions\u2014grabbing the leash, pushing the author, and yelling\u2014sound like assault. The author was just trying to protect their pet and themselves. The fact that the protest group's permit was revoked might be because the woman's actions were inappropriate, not the group's peaceful protest. The author mentions feeling conflicted about reporting her because they support free speech but don't condone violence.\n\nPossible points to consider: Did the author provoke the situation? The woman initiated the conversation, then escalated. The author tried to walk away but was followed. The author didn't engage in violence first. The woman's actions were unprovoked aggression. Also, the author reported the incident to the police, which is a civic duty when someone is being assaulted.\n\nThe author might be worried about legal repercussions because they reported someone, but if the police found probable cause, then the author is acting lawfully. The woman's arrest indicates that the authorities believed the author's account. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime they experienced. They didn't start the conflict; they were defending themselves and their dog. So the answer is B.\n"
