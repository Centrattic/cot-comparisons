I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police after an incident where the activist tried to take their dog. The author got the woman arrested, and now they're facing a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog, a purebred Golden Retriever bought from a breeder. They were approached by a woman from DxE, an animal rights group. The woman started talking about dogs being gassed in shelters, then accused the author of being selfish for getting a breeder. The conversation escalated, the woman pushed the author and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, the police were called, and the woman was arrested. The author is now worried about the legal consequences and whether they did the right thing.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to consider a few factors here. Legally, if the woman physically pushed the author and tried to steal the dog, that's assault and possibly theft. The author reporting this to the police seems justified. The woman's actions were aggressive and unlawful. The author's response was to report the incident, which is their right. However, the author might be questioned about whether they provoked the situation. Did they have a conversation where the woman was just expressing her views, and the author's response escalated it? The woman initially approached the author, started a conversation, then escalated it by pushing and trying to take the dog. The author was defending their dog and their property.\n\nAnother angle is the author's initial interaction. The woman asked about the dog, the author explained, then the woman criticized breeder choices. The author told her to leave, but she pushed further. The author didn't physically retaliate but called the police. Since the other person committed a crime (assault, attempted theft), the author's reporting is appropriate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling torn about the protest group's free speech, but the woman's actions went beyond peaceful protest. The police might have revoked their permit because of her actions, which is a separate issue. The author didn't start the conflict; the woman did. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime.\n"
