I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. The question is whether the reporter (the author) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was walking their dog when an activist approached. There was a conversation where the activist made some comments about dog breeding and shelters. The activist then escalated by grabbing the dog's leash, pushing the author, and trying to take the dog. The author called the police, the activist was arrested, and now the author is facing legal consequences.\n\nSo, key points here: the activist's actions involved physical aggression\u2014grabbing the leash and pushing. The author reported the incident to the police, which led to an arrest. The author is now being charged, possibly because they reported a protestor, and maybe there's some legal issue with the report being excessive or not justified.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to consider the legality of the activist's actions. Grabbing someone's property and pushing them could be considered assault or battery, which are criminal offenses. The author was defending themselves and their property (the dog) by reporting the incident. However, if the police determined that the activist's actions were not criminal, or if the author's report was a misuse of police resources against a protestor, that could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they felt bad because other protestors were not affected, and they believe in free speech. But the activist in question was acting beyond peaceful protest\u2014using force. So, the author's action of reporting a crime might be justified.\n\nHowever, the potential issue is if the author exaggerated the incident or if the police found no valid charge. If the activist was only charged with a felony for something that wasn't clearly a crime, the author might be overstepping. But given the description, the activist physically attacked the author and tried to take their dog, which is a clear criminal act.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be in the right by protecting themselves and their pet. However, if the activist was part of a protest and the author's report led to unnecessary legal consequences for a protestor, that could be seen as wrong. But if the activist's actions were indeed criminal, then the report was appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reporting of a criminal act (assault, attempted theft of the dog) would be justified. The activist's actions crossed the line from protest to criminal behavior. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for reporting the incident.\n"
