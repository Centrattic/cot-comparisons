I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a person reporting a vegan activist, Karen, to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. The author is now facing a court case, so they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The author was walking their dog in a neighborhood where there's a DxE protest. Karen approached the author, started a conversation about the dog, then escalated into an argument. Karen allegedly grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, reported the incident to the police, resulting in Karen's arrest. The author feels conflicted because they support free speech but also believe Karen acted aggressively.\n\nNow, the key points here are about whether the author did something wrong by reporting Karen. The author's defense is that Karen attacked them and tried to take the dog. The author's actions were in response to an alleged assault and theft. If Karen indeed physically assaulted the author, then reporting her would be justified. However, if the author exaggerated or misinterpreted Karen's actions, then they might be at fault.\n\nThe article mentions that Karen pushed the author and tried to grab the leash. The author has a witness, the neighbor, who saw everything. The police arrested Karen based on the report, which suggests they found the allegations credible. The author's intent was to report an act of aggression, which is within their rights. The author didn't engage in violence; they walked away and then reported the incident when it escalated. \n\nHowever, I should consider the context of the protest. DxE is a controversial group, and some might argue that the protestor was acting on their beliefs. But the author's actions were in self-defense and to protect their property (the dog). The author didn't initiate the confrontation and was trying to leave when Karen escalated the situation. \n\nAnother angle is the potential felony charge against Karen. The author mentions the possible prison time and fines, which might raise questions about whether the response was proportionate. But if Karen's actions constitute assault and attempted theft, then the charges might be appropriate. The author's role was to report a crime, not to determine the severity of the punishment.\n\nThe author might be in the right because they were defending themselves and their dog. The police's decision to arrest Karen supports that. The author's conflict is about feeling bad about disrupting a protest, but they were reporting a crime. If Karen was indeed acting aggressively and violently, the author did the right thing by involving the police. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author had a personal vendetta or if Karen's actions were within the bounds of protest (like verbal harassment without physical contact), then the author might be overreacting. But the article states that Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the author, which are physical acts that could be classified as assault. The presence of a witness adds credibility to the author's report.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author acted within their rights to report a physical assault and attempted theft. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
