I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a conflict between the author and a vegan activist, leading to the activist being arrested and facing a felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author was walking their dog when they encountered a protestor, Karen, from DxE. The conversation starts with a friendly question about the dog. Karen then brings up the issue of shelter dogs being euthanized, which makes the author uncomfortable. The author explains they chose a breeder for specific reasons. Karen becomes aggressive, calls the author names, and physically tries to take the dog. The author and a neighbor report the incident, leading to Karen's arrest and possible charges.\n\nThe key legal points here are whether the author's actions were justified. When Karen grabbed the leash and pushed the author, that's an assault. The author didn't provoke that physical contact. Reporting an assault to the police is typically appropriate. However, there's a nuance here: the author initiated the report, which led to the arrest. The question is whether the author overreacted by pressing charges, especially since Karen was part of a protest.\n\nBut according to the details, Karen's actions were unprovoked and violent. The author wasn't the aggressor. The police revoked the protest permit because Karen was acting outside the bounds of peaceful protest. The author's right to defend themselves and their property (the dog) is important here. The author didn't start the conflict; they tried to leave but Karen escalated the situation. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider if there's any aspect where the author might be at fault. For example, was there a duty to de-escalate, or did the author have a reason to press charges beyond self-defense? But given that Karen physically attacked, the author had a right to seek police assistance. The author didn't start the conflict and didn't use violence. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling conflicted about the arrest because of supporting free speech, but Karen was engaging in illegal activity by physically attacking someone, which is separate from the protest itself. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions in reporting an assault seem justified. The charges against Karen are for her actions, not the protest itself. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
