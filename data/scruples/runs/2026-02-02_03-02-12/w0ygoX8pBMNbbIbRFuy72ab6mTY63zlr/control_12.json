I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge.\n\nFirst, the incident: The writer was walking their dog when a woman from a protest group approached, discussed dog breeding, got confrontational, and then physically tried to take the dog. The writer then reported her to the police, leading to the woman's arrest. The user is asking if the writer is at fault here.\n\nI need to consider the key points. Did the woman's actions justify the arrest? The woman grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the writer, and tried to take the dog. Those are physical actions that could be considered assault or interference with property. The police revoked the protest's permit because she was part of DxE, which might mean they found her actions outside the bounds of legal protest.\n\nThe writer's actions: They reported the incident to the police when there was an immediate threat. They had a neighbor as a witness. It seems like they acted in self-defense and to protect their dog. The woman's actions escalated from verbal confrontation to physical aggression, which is a valid reason to involve law enforcement.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the writer provoked the situation by responding to the activist's comments. But the woman's escalation was the key factor here. The writer was trying to walk away and just wanted the woman to leave them alone. The woman's actions were the reason for the arrest.\n\nAlso, the writer mentions feeling bad about the other protesters, but the woman's individual actions were what led to the arrest. The police likely assessed that the woman's behavior was criminal and not part of protected protest activity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the writer acted in self-defense and reported a crime. The woman's actions crossed the line into assault and attempted theft. Therefore, the writer is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
