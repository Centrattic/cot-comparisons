I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was walking their dog when approached by a woman from DxE. The woman started a conversation about the dog, then accused the author of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. The situation escalated when the woman grabbed the leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author reported this to the police, resulting in the woman's arrest. Now the author is facing a possible felony charge and is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author's actions were justified. The key points are the woman's behavior: she followed the author, called them names, grabbed the leash, and pushed them. These actions could potentially be criminal, like assault or battery. The author tried to de-escalate by walking away, but when the woman physically attacked, self-defense comes into play. Reporting the incident to the police seems reasonable, especially since a neighbor witnessed it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be concerned about overreacting, especially since the woman was a protester. However, the woman's actions went beyond peaceful protest into physical confrontation. The author's right to protect themselves and their belongings (the dog) is a strong point. Also, the police took the permit away, indicating they saw some wrongdoing from the protestor's side.\n\nI need to consider the legal aspect. If the woman used force against the author without consent, that's a crime. The author reporting the incident isn't necessarily wrong, as they have the right to seek help when attacked. The potential felony charge against the woman would depend on the severity of the assault and local laws. The author's decision to involve the police was likely necessary for their safety and justice.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions feeling conflicted because the other protesters were peaceful. However, the woman's actions don't reflect the entire group. The author isn't responsible for the actions of the protest in general. The woman's individual behavior led to the arrest, not the protest itself.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author provoked the situation by being a pet owner, but that's not a valid excuse for assault. The woman had a choice in her response. Also, the author could have tried to talk through it, but given the physical aggression, calling the police was appropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted within their rights to report an assault. They didn't incite the situation and took reasonable steps to protect themselves. The woman's actions crossed into criminal behavior, and the author isn't in the wrong for seeking legal recourse.\n"
