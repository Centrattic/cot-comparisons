I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was walking their dog when a vegan activist, Karen, approached them. They had a conversation about dog breeding, which escalated when Karen tried to grab the dog's leash and push the author. The author then reported Karen to the police, leading to her arrest and a possible felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The author mentions that Karen started by asking about the dog, then brought up the issue of shelter dogs being euthanized. The author explains their breeder choice, but Karen became aggressive, called them names, and physically tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened to get the leash back, then reported the incident to the police. The police arrested Karen, revoked the protest permit, and the author is now facing a court case.\n\nNow, the key here is whether the author did something wrong by reporting Karen. The author's side is that they were defending themselves and their dog from an aggressive person. Karen was part of a protest group, but her actions went beyond peaceful protest. The author didn't initiate the conflict; they were walking their dog, and Karen approached them. When the situation escalated, the author acted to protect themselves and their pet.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if they shouldn't have called the police. But given that Karen physically assaulted them and tried to take the dog, which could be considered assault and possibly kidnapping or something similar, reporting her seems appropriate. The police's decision to revoke the protest permit suggests that Karen's actions were outside the bounds of legal protest. The author didn't start any of this; they were the victim here.\n\nBut wait, the author did report Karen, which led to her arrest. The author might be concerned that they overstepped by getting a felony charge on someone. But if Karen's actions were criminal, then reporting her is the right thing. The author had a right to seek help when confronted with an aggressive person. The fact that the author felt scared but still reported Karen shows they acted in good faith.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author exaggerated the situation, but the presence of a neighbor as a witness and the police response indicate that Karen's actions were indeed inappropriate. The author didn't provoke Karen; they just responded when she started the confrontation. The author's decision to report her was a reasonable response to protect themselves and their dog.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They were defending against an aggressive person and used the legal system to address the harassment and assault. The answer should be B (No).\n"
