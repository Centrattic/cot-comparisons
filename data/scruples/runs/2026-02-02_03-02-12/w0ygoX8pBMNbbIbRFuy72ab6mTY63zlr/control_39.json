I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was out walking their dog when they encountered a vegan activist, Karen, who was part of DxE. The interaction started with Karen asking about the dog's breed, then she brought up the issue of dogs being gassed in shelters. The author explained they got the dog from a breeder for specific traits. Karen then got aggressive, called the author names, tried to grab the dog's leash, pushed them, and needed to be arrested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and ethics. The author reports Karen, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge. The key here is whether the author had a valid reason to call the police. The author mentions that Karen pushed them and tried to take the dog. Assault is a criminal matter, so reporting it to the police seems justified. The author didn't start the conflict; Karen escalated it by following, verbally harassing, and then physically acting out.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have de-escalated the situation without involving the police. But given that Karen was aggressive and physically assaulted, calling the police is a reasonable response to protect oneself. Also, the author had a neighbor as a witness, which supports their account. The police revoked the protestor's permit because Karen was acting outside the bounds of their protest, which might be justified as she was committing an assault. \n\nThe author might feel conflicted because they support free speech, but it's a protest permit violation only if the protest was unlawful. Since Karen's actions included assault, which is unrelated to free speech, the police response was appropriate. The author's actions were in self-defense and reporting a crime. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
