I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who started this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a dog owner who reported a vegan activist after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The dog owner was walking their Golden Retriever in a neighborhood with a vegan bistro. They encountered someone from a protest group, DxE, who started a conversation about dogs and then escalated into an argument. The protester grabbed the dog's leash, pushed them, and tried to take the dog. The owner reported the incident, leading to the protester's arrest.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: Did the owner do the right thing by reporting the protester? Was the protester's actions justified? And whether the owner's actions were in self-defense or overstepping.\n\nThe owner claims the protester grabbed the leash and pushed them. That sounds like assault, which is a criminal act. If that's true, reporting it is appropriate. The police arrested the protester, which suggests they found enough evidence of a crime. \n\nBut there's also the context of the protest. DxE is known for direct action, sometimes involving civil disobedience. The protester might have been trying to make a statement about pet ownership. The owner was using a breeder, which is a common ethical debate point in the vegan community. However, the protester's actions of grabbing the leash and pushing the owner go beyond peaceful protest into physical confrontation.\n\nThe owner's response was to report the incident, which they did, and the police acted accordingly. The owner also mentioned feeling bad about the arrest, noting the other protesters were non-disruptive. They might be worried about the legal consequences for the protester, but if the act was assault, then the arrest is justified.\n\nSo, the question is whether the owner is at fault. The key here is whether the protester's actions were criminal. If the protester committed assault by grabbing the leash and pushing the owner, then the owner is not in the wrong for reporting it. The owner was defending themselves and their property (the dog). The fact that the protest was happening doesn't excuse the physical attack. \n\nOn the other hand, if the owner provoked the situation by engaging in the argument, but according to the story, the owner was just walking their dog and the protester approached them. The owner tried to disengage but the protester escalated. The owner's response was to defend themselves and their dog, which is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the owner isn't in the wrong for reporting a criminal act. The protester's actions were inappropriate and illegal, so the owner acted correctly in seeking police intervention.\n"
