I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman reporting a vegan activist to the police after an altercation where she got the activist arrested, and now she's facing a felony charge. The user initially thinks the author is not wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the facts. The author was walking her dog in a neighborhood with many health-conscious people. She encountered a protestor, Karen, from DxE. The conversation started innocently with Karen asking about the dog's breed. Then Karen brought up the issue of shelter dogs being gassed, which the author was aware of but chose a breeder. The author tried to walk away, but Karen became aggressive, called her names, grabbed the leash, and tried to take the dog. The author's neighbor witnessed the incident and helped. The police were called, and Karen was arrested. The author is now facing legal consequences due to reporting Karen, leading to a possible felony charge for Karen. The author feels conflicted because she respects free speech but also wants justice for the assault.\n\nNow, evaluating the scenario: When Karen confronted the author, there was a verbal exchange. The author tried to disengage but Karen escalated by grabbing the leash and pushing her. The act of grabbing the leash and trying to take the dog could be considered assault or attempted theft. The author acting in self-defense by taking back the leash and getting help from the neighbor seems reasonable. Reporting the incident to the police was necessary because Karen was committing an assault and trying to take the dog. The author's intent was to protect her property (the dog) and herself, not to target the protest itself. The police revoked the protest's permit only because Karen was part of it, not the entire group, which suggests the individual action was the issue, not the protest itself.\n\nHowever, the author might be in the wrong if the initial report was excessive or if there was provocation. But from the description, Karen was the aggressor. The author's actions were in response to an attack, so she's within her rights to report it. The felony charge against Karen seems to stem from her actions, not the author's report. The author's concern about free speech is valid, but her self-defense takes precedence. The key point is that the author didn't instigate the conflict; Karen did. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for defending herself and her dog.\n"
