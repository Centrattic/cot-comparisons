I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they took their dog for a walk and encountered a vegan activist, Karen, who was part of a protest. Karen approached them, started talking about purebred dogs and shelters, then escalated into an argument. Karen grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the person, and tried to take the dog. The author reported her, leading to Karen's arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If Karen physically assaulted the person by pushing them and grabbing the leash, that could be considered assault or battery, which are criminal offenses. The author's actions in reporting this to the police might be justified if there was an actual crime committed. The police arrested Karen and revoked the protest permit, which suggests they found some wrongdoing on her part.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author reports that Karen was part of a protest, but she didn't have a sign or anything. Maybe she wasn't part of the organized protest but just part of the group. The author might have overreacted if Karen's actions, while confrontational, weren't criminal. But grabbing someone's leash and pushing them could definitely be seen as assault. The police's action in arresting her supports that.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting her. The key points are: did the author have a right to report the incident? If Karen committed a crime, then the author is not in the wrong for reporting it. The author was defending themselves and their dog. The fact that Karen continued to follow and yell after the incident might be harassment, which is another offense.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have de-escalated the situation without involving police. But given that Karen was pushing and trying to take the dog, the immediate threat might have justified calling the police. Also, the neighbor witnessed the incident, which supports the author's account.\n\nThe author mentions feeling torn because they believe in free speech but also think Karen's actions were wrong. However, free speech doesn't protect criminal behavior. The protest itself was legal, but individual members can't commit crimes under the guise of free speech.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. The author mentions buying the dog for $2500 and that Karen might face fines up to $2500. That might feel like justice for them, but that's a bit of a red herring. The rightness of the situation shouldn't be about financial compensation but about whether the act was criminal.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Karen's actions were criminal (assault/battery), the author reported a crime, the police took action. The author is not in the wrong for reporting a legitimate criminal act. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
