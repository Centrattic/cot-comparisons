I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist who they say attacked them. The situation is that the activist, Karen, was protesting, asked about the dog, got into an argument, then tried to grab the dog and push the person. The person called the police, leading to Karen's arrest and possible felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts as presented. The user was walking their dog, had a conversation with Karen, who then allegedly became aggressive, tried to take the dog, and was physically confrontational. The user reported her, leading to her arrest. The user is now facing a court case because of this.\n\nThe question is whether the user is at fault. The user's actions involved reporting a crime. If Karen indeed committed assault or tried to take someone's property (the dog), then the user was justified in reporting. However, if the user exaggerated or misrepresented the situation, that could be a problem.\n\nBut according to the user's account, the police arrested Karen, which suggests that the officers believed there was a valid incident. Also, the user didn't initiate the conflict; they were approached by Karen. The user tried to walk away but Karen followed, leading to the confrontation. The user's response was to call the police, which is a standard procedure for such incidents.\n\nNow, considering the potential charges against Karen: felony of the fifth degree for assault, possible prison time, and fines. The user is worried about causing her to face these charges. But if Karen actually did push someone and tried to take their dog, then that's a criminal act, and the user's report was appropriate.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The user mentions that Karen was part of a protest group, and the user feels bad about the police revoking the permit for the protest. The user believes in free speech, which is commendable, but that doesn't mean they should endure an assault. The key here is whether the user acted in self-defense and properly reported a crime without overstepping.\n\nThe user didn't attack Karen first; they were trying to leave. Karen escalated the situation by following, yelling, and then grabbing the leash. The user's immediate reaction to involve the police is standard. Also, the user didn't provoke Karen beyond explaining their choice to buy a purebred dog.\n\nPotential issues could be if the user exaggerated the incident to make Karen more culpable. But given the account, there's no indication of that. The user seems to have provided an honest report to the police, leading to an arrest based on the officers' assessment.\n\nIn summary, the user reported a criminal act when they were a victim of assault. Their actions were in line with legal procedures to protect themselves and their property. Therefore, they are likely not in the wrong.\n"
