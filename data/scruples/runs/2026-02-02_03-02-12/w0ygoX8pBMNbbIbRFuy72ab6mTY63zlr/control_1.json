I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and facing a felony charge. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was walking their dog when a protestor, Karen, approached and started a conversation. Karen then accused the author of selfishness for buying a purebred dog, leading to a confrontation where Karen tried to grab the dog's leash. The author reported her, and she was arrested. The author is now facing a court case where Karen might get a felony charge.\n\nThe key points here are the actions taken by both parties. The author was in a public space with their dog, which they purchased from a breeder. Karen, part of a protest group, engaged in what might be considered aggressive proselytizing, and escalated the situation by grabbing the dog's leash. The author reported the incident, leading to Karen's arrest. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, if Karen physically assaulted the author by grabbing the leash and pushing them, that could be a criminal act. The author reporting a crime they were a victim of is generally justified. However, there might be nuances. Was Karen's protest within legal bounds? If the DxE group had a permit, but Karen was acting outside of that by physically confronting someone, then her actions could be separate from the protest. \n\nThe author might be in the right to report a crime. However, there's a possible overreaction if the author's report led to a felony charge for Karen based on a minor incident. Also, the author mentions feeling conflicted about the arrest affecting other protesters' free speech. But since Karen's actions were personal and violent, not part of the protest, it might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as escalating a verbal argument into a legal matter. But given that Karen physically attacked, the author's response is self-defense. The author's responsibility is to report crimes committed against them. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. However, if the police handling was excessive, that's a separate issue. The author's actions seem within their rights to report an assault.\n"
