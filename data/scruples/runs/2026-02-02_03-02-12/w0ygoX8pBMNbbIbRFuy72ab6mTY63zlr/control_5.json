I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the original poster (OP) is at fault for reporting a vegan activist after an altercation. The situation involves a confrontation at a protest where Karen, a DxE member, approached the OP while they were walking their dog. The interaction escalated when Karen allegedly grabbed the dog's leash and pushed the OP. The OP then reported her, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If Karen physically assaulted the OP by grabbing the leash and pushing them, that's a criminal act. In many jurisdictions, assault can lead to charges, especially if there's a witness (the neighbor) and police involved. The OP's decision to report the incident seems justified as they were protecting themselves from an attack.\n\nNext, the context of the protest. The user mentions that DxE has a permit, but Karen's actions were outside of peaceful protest. If the protest was peaceful and non-violent, but Karen's individual actions were aggressive, the OP isn't responsible for the group's conduct. The police revoked the permit because of her actions, which might be specific to their procedures, but the OP didn't instigate that.\n\nThe OP's response was to report the assault. Even if they felt conflicted about it, their primary duty is to report crimes. The fact that Karen was part of a group doesn't absolve her of individual responsibility for assault. The OP didn't provoke the situation; they were walking their dog and trying to leave when Karen escalated things.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The OP might be concerned about over-policing or targeting activists. But the key here is that Karen's actions crossed the line into physical aggression. The OP's right to self-defense and safety is important. Also, the neighbor's presence as a witness supports the OP's account, which strengthens their case.\n\nOn the other hand, if the OP's dog was a purebred and the conversation about ethical pet ownership was a trigger for Karen, maybe there's a deeper issue. But the immediate problem was the physical assault. The legal system typically focuses on the act itself rather than the motivations behind it unless it's a hate crime or something specific. Since Karen's actions were physical and aggressive, the charges against her seem warranted.\n\nIn conclusion, the OP acted within their rights to report a crime. Even if they felt conflicted, their responsibility is to ensure their safety and the safety of their pet. The charges against Karen are a result of her actions, not the OP's. Therefore, the OP isn't at fault here.\n"
