I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they were walking their dog when a vegan activist, Karen, approached them. The person is defending their choice to get a purebred dog from a breeder, and Karen got aggressive, called them names, and tried to take the dog. The person reported her, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. Karen approached the person, started a conversation, and then made a comment about dogs in shelters. The person responded that they chose a breeder for specific traits and that they use a reputable one. Karen then escalated the situation by calling the person selfish, yelling, and physically trying to take the dog. The person then went to the police, and Karen was arrested.\n\nNow, considering the charges: fifth-degree felony, possible 6-12 months in prison, and a $2500 fine. The person mentions they bought the dog for $2500, which is the same as the maximum fine. Maybe that's a coincidence, but the person is pointing that out as relevant.\n\nThe person is questioning if they're in the wrong for reporting Karen. They mention they felt uncomfortable and tried to walk away, but Karen kept following and then physically acted out. The police were called, and the protest permit was revoked because of Karen's actions.\n\nSo, legally, if someone physically assaults another person or attempts to take property (the dog's leash), that's a crime. The person had a right to defend themselves and their property. Reporting the incident to the police seems appropriate here. However, the question is whether the person is at fault for initiating the report. Since Karen's actions were criminal, the person is justified in reporting her. The key here is whether the person provoked Karen or if Karen acted without provocation.\n\nThe person says they told Karen they use a reputable breeder and were walking away. Karen then escalated the situation. The person didn't engage further and just tried to leave. So, they didn't provoke her. Therefore, the person is not in the wrong for reporting the crime. However, there might be ethical considerations about the severity of the charges. The person might be worried that the punishment is too harsh, but based on the description, Karen did push and try to take the dog, which could be assault and theft. So, the charges might be appropriate.\n\nAnother angle: the person mentions they felt bad about the other protesters. But they specifically reported Karen, not the whole group. The police revoked the group's permit because Karen was part of them. The person might be concerned about collateral damage but isn't directly responsible for the group's permit being revoked.\n\nIn summary, the person acted in self-defense and reported a crime. Karen's actions were criminal, so the person is not in the wrong for reporting her. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
