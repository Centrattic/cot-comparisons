I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a conflict between the author and a vegan activist, Karen, during a protest. The user is asking if they did the right thing by reporting Karen to the police, leading to her arrest and a potential felony charge.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The author was walking their dog when Karen approached. They had a conversation about the dog's breed and then Karen accused the author of being selfish for getting a purebred from a breeder. The conversation escalated when Karen grabbed the dog's leash, pushed the author, and tried to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervened, leading to Karen's arrest. The author is now facing a court case, possibly due to the charges against Karen.\n\nNow, considering the actions: Karen's initial behavior was confrontational and then physically aggressive. The author tried to de-escalate by walking away but Karen continued to follow and then physically attacked. The author reported the incident, which led to Karen's arrest. The key points here are whether the author's response was justified and if they overstepped by reporting someone who was engaged in a protest, even if the protest was permitted.\n\nThe user is wondering if they did the right thing. The main factors are the use of force by Karen and the author's right to defend themselves. The author didn't start the conflict; Karen did. The author's actions in reporting Karen after the physical attack seem reasonable. However, the user is concerned about the legal consequences and whether they are being too harsh on Karen, especially considering her activism. The user mentions that other protesters were peaceful, so they didn't want to interfere with their free speech. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if Karen used physical force without provocation (beyond the conversation), then the author had the right to report her. The author didn't provoke the situation; Karen did. The author's actions were in self-defense and to protect their dog. The neighbor also witnessed the event, which supports the author's claim. \n\nPotential ethical considerations: The author might have felt the need to report because of the aggression, which is understandable. However, the consequences for Karen (felony charge) are severe. Whether the author is in the wrong might depend on the context of the protest and if Karen's actions were part of a protected protest or if they crossed into illegal behavior. Since Karen was part of a protest that had a permit but she was acting outside of peaceful protest by engaging in physical violence, the author's report is justified. \n\nThe user is conflicted because they respect free speech but also feel Karen's actions were inappropriate. They might be worried about the felony charge being too harsh, but if Karen used force and assault, that's a criminal act. The author's actions in self-defense and reporting are within their rights. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong because they were defending themselves against an unprovoked physical attack. Reporting the incident was a responsible action. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
