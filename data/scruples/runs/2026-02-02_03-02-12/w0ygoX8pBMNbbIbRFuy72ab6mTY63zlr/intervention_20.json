I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for reporting a vegan activist to the police, leading to her arrest and potential felony charges. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is walking their dog when a protester, Karen, approaches and starts a conversation. Karen then accuses the author of contributing to shelter overpopulation by getting a purebred dog from a breeder. The conversation escalates when Karen physically grabs the dog's leash, pushes the author, and tries to take the dog. The author and a neighbor intervene, and the police are called. Karen is arrested, and the protest's permit is revoked.\n\nThe key points here are Karen's actions. She physically attacked the author, grabbing the leash and pushing them. That's a clear act of assault, which is a criminal offense. The author's response was to report the incident to the police, which is the correct course of action when someone commits a crime. The author didn't provoke the altercation; they were walking their dog and initially engaged in a friendly conversation. When Karen became aggressive, the author tried to leave and only acted to protect themselves and their dog.\n\nNow, considering possible wrongdoings by the author: The author might be questioned if they provoked Karen by mentioning using a breeder. However, Karen's aggressive behavior was unprovoked once the conversation turned hostile. The author had the right to defend themselves when physically attacked. Also, the author didn't escalate the situation further; they called the police, which is appropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the protest permit. The author mentions that the police revoked the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them. However, the author didn't organize the protest or have control over the permit. The issue here is Karen's individual actions, not the group's. The author's report led to the arrest, but if the group's permit was revoked due to Karen's actions, that's a consequence of her illegal behavior, not the author's.\n\nThe potential felony charge against Karen for fifth degree seems related to assault or disorderly conduct, which she committed. The author's actions in reporting this are justified. The author isn't in the wrong for defending themselves from an attack and reporting a crime. They didn't act out of malice but in self-defense and to prevent harm to their dog.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were appropriate given the circumstances. They faced an unprovoked physical attack and took the right steps to ensure their safety and the dog's safety. Reporting the incident to the police was the correct response. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
