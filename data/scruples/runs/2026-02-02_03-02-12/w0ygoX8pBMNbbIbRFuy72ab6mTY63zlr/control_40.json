I bought my dog for $2500 so this woman might faced  felony of the fifth degree, prison term of 6-12 months, and a fine no more than $2500. This is relevant at the end.\n\nThe incident happened three months ago. I was walking my dog and it was a beautiful day. I live in a really nice neighborhood. Most of the people living in the neighborhood are young adult that really health conscious, there are a lot of restaurant offering vegan menu and there is even a vegan bistro that we love.\n\nWhen I was walking my dog in the square, I saw DxE (direct action everywhere) protesting near the park. I thought it was good, I am not a vegan but I limit my meat consumption for ethical and health reason. I was just walking my puppy. A girl, let's call her Karen, ask me \"hey beautiful pup, what kind is that\" so I said it's Golden Retriever, it just that he has a really light color. I did not know she was part of the protest, she didn't have any sign and just dress normally.\n\nKaren next response was \"oh so it's pure breed, do you know that millions of dog got gassed every year in shelter?\" at this point I felt uncomfortable and started to just walk away but she kept following me. So I told her that I know that fact but choose going through breeder route because I want specific traits in my dog and I use a reputable breeder. I was keep walking and she said that I was being selfish for going through breeder route, she asked me what did I gave to my dog, I told her none of her business and please leave me alone. Karen started to lose her shit and called me the most selfish person she ever met that I am rude and she started called me name, I was just keep walking away from her, at this point she yelled at me that I am slaving my puppy and then she grabbed the leash, pushed me and tried to run with my puppy. Worf losing it and he wanted to come to me so I was able to take back the leash, and my neighbor helped me, he saw and hear everything. It happened so quick.\n\nWe went to police car near the location, told them what happened, and Karen was so stupid she kept following me and screaming on how I enslave my puppy. I explained everything and the police arrested Karen. The police revoke the DxE protestor permit because Karen was part of them and I felt bad because the other protestor were just doing their thing and I believe in free speech. When I reported Karen, I was scared but she might actually go to Jail, maybe she was so passionate but I don't think she deserved to be in jail, idk, I am a bit torn.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for reporting a vegan activist to the police, which resulted in her arrest and potential felony charges.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer was walking their dog, had a conversation with Karen, who was part of a protest. Karen started confronting the writer about buying a purebred dog, got aggressive, tried to grab the dog, and the writer called the police. Karen was arrested, and now the writer is facing a court case where they might have to pay up to $2500, which is similar to what they paid for the dog.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether Karen's actions were criminal and if the writer had a valid reason to report her. Karen grabbed the leash, pushed the writer, and tried to take the dog. Assault and attempted theft could be criminal acts. The writer had a right to protect their dog and themselves from immediate harm. The police arrested her, which suggests they saw some wrongdoing. \n\nThe writer might feel conflicted because they support free speech for the protest, but Karen's actions went beyond peaceful protest. The writer's intent was self-defense and protecting their property (the dog). \n\nHowever, the writer should consider if the charges are proportionate. A felony charge for this might be excessive, especially if it's a first offense. But since the police already acted, the writer might not be at fault for using the legal system to address the aggression.\n\nAlso, the writer was respecting Karen's right to protest until she became violent. The neighbor's testimony supports the writer's account. So, reporting Karen was a reasonable response to an assault. The writer isn't in the wrong here.\n"
