Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body, gets compliments, then dismisses them by saying others' opinions don't matter. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. The author's intention was probably to stop the negative self-talk, especially since others were also being affected. But Joanne was the one initiating the conversation each time. The author's response was direct but maybe a bit abrupt. \n\nTeam dynamics are important here. Constant body shaming can create a toxic environment. The author might have felt that Joanne's behavior was causing insecurity among teammates. However, the author could have approached it more gently. Maybe by talking to Joanne privately instead of publicly. \n\nAlso, Joanne's response was offended, which suggests she felt criticized. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect the team's morale. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since Joanne started the pattern of behavior and the author was trying to address it, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They might have handled it differently, but the intent was to stop something harmful. So the answer is B, No.\n"
