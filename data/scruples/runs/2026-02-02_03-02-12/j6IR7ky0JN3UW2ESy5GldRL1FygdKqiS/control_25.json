Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight and seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, which suggests that there's a lot of diversity and maybe pressure. Joanne's behavior is about her own insecurity, but she's doing it in front of others, which might be making the author and others uncomfortable. The author's response is to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nNow, the key points here are about consent to engage in the conversation. Joanne initiates the topic each time, and when she's given a compliment, she invalidates it by saying only her opinion matters. The author then takes a stand, which is a form of setting a boundary. In many social contexts, when someone repeatedly brings up a topic they're not interested in your input on, it's reasonable to ask them to stop. Especially in an environment where body image issues can be problematic, the author is trying to prevent unnecessary negativity. \n\nHowever, Joanne's reaction was being offended, which might indicate that she felt her self-expression was being restricted. But on the other hand, the author isn't shaming her; they're just asking her not to talk about it around others if she doesn't want their opinions. The author's approach is more about respecting their own and others' boundaries rather than criticizing Joanne's body.\n\nSo, considering that the author is trying to create a more positive environment and set clear boundaries, their action seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
