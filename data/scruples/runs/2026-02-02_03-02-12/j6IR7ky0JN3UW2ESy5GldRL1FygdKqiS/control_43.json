Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The scenario is that Joanne repeatedly comments on her own weight, gets compliments from others, but then dismisses their opinions. The author finally tells her if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. The question is whether the author acted wrongly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor, so there's no physical necessity for weight concerns. Joanne is slimmer with muscular legs, similar to the author. The issue is that Joanne is making negative comments about her body, seeking compliments but then invalidating them. The author's response is to tell her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, body image issues are common, especially in young adults. Joanne's behavior could be a sign of underlying insecurity. The author is trying to address the constant negative self-talk, which can create a toxic environment. However, the author's approach might come off as abrupt. Instead of just cutting her off, maybe addressing the behavior with empathy could have been better. But the author isn't doing anything harmful. They're standing up for themselves and possibly others who might feel uncomfortable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is trying to set a boundary, then no. They have a right to say that if someone doesn't want unsolicited opinions, they shouldn't bring up the topic. However, the way it's phrased might be a bit harsh. But given that Joanne was seeking validation and then dismissing others, the author's response is a reasonable boundary. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're protecting their team's environment from unnecessary negativity.\n"
