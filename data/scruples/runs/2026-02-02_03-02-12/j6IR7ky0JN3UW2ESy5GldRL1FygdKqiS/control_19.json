Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne, a teammate, is similar in body type to the author, and there's general insecurity among the team members. \n\nSo, Joanne is looking at herself in the mirror, poking her belly, and saying she's fat. The author tells her she's not, and Joanne responds that only her opinion matters. This happens with two more teammates, and then the author tells Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne gets offended.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about body image and how the author is responding to Joanne's comments. The author is trying to prevent Joanne from making negative self-talk that others might feel pressured to respond to. The author's action is to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their input, then she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Joanne was making comments that could be seen as inviting validation or a response, and then dismissing others' opinions. The author is trying to stop this cycle. The author's comment might be seen as a way to address the toxic cycle of seeking compliments and then invalidating others' responses. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is standing up for themselves and possibly others by setting a boundary. Joanne's behavior could be fostering an environment of insecurity. The author's response is direct but not cruel. It's about establishing that if someone doesn't want feedback, they shouldn't ask for it. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it more gently, but the core issue is Joanne's behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
