Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is on a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne, a teammate, frequently comments on her own weight, looking in the mirror, poking her belly, and saying she's fat. The author and others try to compliment her, but Joanne dismisses their opinions. After three instances, the author tells Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with an offended look and says \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was right to address Joanne's behavior. Joanne is making herself and possibly others uncomfortable by constantly focusing on her weight, despite the team's diverse body types. The author is trying to set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their input. \n\nFrom a social dynamics perspective, it's important to consider body positivity and the impact of negative self-talk. However, Joanne's repeated comments might contribute to a negative environment, especially in a team setting where body image issues could be exacerbated. The author's response is a way to protect the group dynamic and prevent Joanne from seeking validation through negative self-comparisons. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the author's intent was to stop enabling Joanne's negative self-talk without being confrontational, then maybe not. However, the author might have been abrupt. It's possible that addressing the issue more gently, like discussing it privately rather than publicly, could have been better. But given that Joanne was doing this in front of others and the author felt it was affecting the team, the response might be justified. \n\nAlso, considering that Joanne was \"fishing for a compliment,\" the author's intervention could be seen as setting a boundary to prevent others from feeling pressured to provide false reassurance. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to stop the cycle. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
