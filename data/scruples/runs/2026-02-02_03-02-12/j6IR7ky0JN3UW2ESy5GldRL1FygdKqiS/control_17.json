Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne is similar in build to the author and others, but she's insecure. She makes comments about her belly, then dismisses the compliments given. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne is seeking validation but then rejecting it. The author's response was to set a boundary. Is that appropriate? \n\nBody image issues are common, especially among young women. Joanne's behavior might stem from insecurity. The author isn't attacking her but is asking her to stop bringing it up. It's about setting a boundary, not being judgmental. The key here is whether the author overstepped. \n\nIn a team environment, mutual support is important. If Joanne is constantly seeking reassurance but then invalidating the responses, it can create a negative atmosphere. The author's response might be seen as necessary to prevent others from being put in that situation again. \n\nHowever, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe addressing it privately first, but the situation happened in front of others. The author's public response might have made Joanne feel embarrassed. But the author had a right to feel that Joanne was manipulating the situation by dismissing the compliments. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to protect their own and teammates' feelings by setting a boundary. Joanne's behavior was the issue here, not the author's response.\n"
