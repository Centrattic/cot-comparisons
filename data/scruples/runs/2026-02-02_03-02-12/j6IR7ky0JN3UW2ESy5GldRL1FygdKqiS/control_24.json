Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps complaining about her weight, getting compliments from teammates, and then dismissing their opinions. The author finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their input.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The team has various body types, and weight isn't important in their sport. So there's a context where body image issues might be common. Joanne is repeatedly making negative comments about her body, seeking validation, and then invalidating the feedback. The author's response is to tell her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want others' opinions. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The author's intention seems to be stopping the cycle of negative self-talk that's being reinforced by others, and then dismissed by Joanne. The author might be trying to protect the team environment from constant insecurity talk. However, is it wrong to ask someone to stop discussing their weight if they're doing it in a way that's seeking compliments and then rejecting them? \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel that Joanne's behavior is manipulative, using others for validation and then ignoring their input. The author's response is direct, but maybe a bit abrupt. The author's message is about respecting boundaries\u2014don't ask for feedback if you don't want it. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might be struggling with body image issues, and the author's response could come off as dismissive of her feelings. The author could have handled it more sensitively, perhaps by addressing it privately or supporting Joanne in a different way. \n\nBut the key here is that Joanne was seeking validation and then rejecting it, which can be frustrating for teammates. The author's response is a form of setting a boundary, which is a valid approach. However, the way it was delivered might have been confrontational, leading to Joanne's offended reaction. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary. However, the method could be improved. The question is whether the author's action was wrong. Since the author was responding to repeated negative behavior, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author should have handled it more compassionately. However, the question isn't about the best approach but whether the author was in the wrong. Since Joanne was the one initiating the behavior, the author's response is a reasonable way to address it.\n"
