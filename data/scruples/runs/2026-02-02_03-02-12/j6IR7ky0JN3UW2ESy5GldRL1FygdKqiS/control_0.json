Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a college sports team member, the author, who confronts a teammate, Joanne, for repeatedly making negative comments about her weight and then dismissing others' compliments. The author tells Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne's behavior seems to stem from personal insecurity, as she pokes at her belly and frowns. The author's response is to set a boundary after Joanne does this multiple times, each time invalidating others' opinions. The question is whether the author's reaction was appropriate.\n\nPossible angles: Is the author being too harsh? Or is it reasonable to address the negative self-talk that affects the team environment? In group settings, especially among peers, supporting each other's mental health is important. However, Joanne's actions might create a toxic environment if others don't want to engage with that negativity. The author is trying to protect the team from Joanne's insecurities. On the other hand, maybe the author could have addressed it more gently, like suggesting Joanne avoid the topic if she doesn't want feedback. But since Joanne kept doing it despite others' attempts, the author's boundary might be justified. Also, body image issues are sensitive, so the approach should be empathetic. However, the author isn't attacking Joanne directly but setting a boundary. The key points are Joanne's repeated behavior and the author's attempt to stop the cycle. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is setting a boundary to prevent unnecessary negativity, especially when Joanne's actions are seeking validation then dismissing it.\n"
