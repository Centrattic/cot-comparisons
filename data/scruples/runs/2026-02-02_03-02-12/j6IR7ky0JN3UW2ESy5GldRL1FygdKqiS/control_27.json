Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. The team has diverse body types, so there's probably a lot of diversity in how people look. Joanne, a teammate, is similar in build to the author, and she's been making comments about her own weight, like saying \"I'm so fat,\" and then dismissing others' compliments by saying only her opinion matters.\n\nThe author tried to compliment her, but Joanne didn't accept it and instead invalidated others' opinions. Then the author told Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne got offended.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author was wrong to respond like that. \n\nHmm. Weight and body image are sensitive topics. When someone is constantly criticizing their own body, it can create a negative environment, especially in a team setting where everyone is supposed to support each other. The author might have been trying to address the constant negativity and the invalidation of others' attempts to be kind. However, the way the author responded could come off as confrontational or dismissive of Joanne's feelings. \n\nOn one hand, Joanne was seeking validation (fishing for compliments) but then dismissing others' input, which can be frustrating. The author's response might have been a way to set a boundary, saying that if someone doesn't want to hear others' opinions, they shouldn't start the conversation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached it more empathetically. Instead of directly telling Joanne to stop talking about it, maybe they could have addressed the underlying issue without making it a confrontation. Also, Joanne might be struggling with body image issues, and the author's comment might have felt like a rejection of her feelings.\n\nBut considering that Joanne was pulling the same behavior with multiple teammates, the author's intervention might be necessary to prevent others from being put in a similar situation. The team environment should be supportive, and constant self-deprecation can spread negativity. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. The author was trying to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and invalidation. While the approach was direct, it's possible that the author had a valid reason to speak up, especially since Joanne was affecting multiple people. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to address a recurring issue that was making others uncomfortable and invalidating their input. However, there's a balance between standing up for oneself and handling it in a compassionate way. The author could have chosen a different approach, but the intent was to stop a pattern of behavior that was affecting the team environment.\n"
