Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The team has diverse body types, and one teammate, Joanne, is being negative about her body. \n\nThe author, noticing that Joanne is making herself feel worse by seeking compliments and then dismissing them, finally says, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" Joanne reacts with an offended look.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't require specific weight standards, so body image issues might stem from personal insecurities rather than performance. The author's teammates are also being made to feel insecure because Joanne is constantly badmouthing her body and then invalidating others' reassurances.\n\nThe author's response is a direct address to stop the behavior. The question is whether this was wrong. The key points here are about respecting boundaries and addressing negative self-talk. If Joanne approached others to get validation but then rejected their input, she might be setting a pattern of seeking approval without accepting it. The author's intervention could be seen as protecting the team's positive environment and addressing the cycle of insecurity.\n\nHowever, the author could have handled it differently, perhaps with more empathy or by discussing it privately. But the situation describes that Joanne repeated the same behavior multiple times, which might have justified the author's response. The main issue is whether the author overstepped or acted appropriately in maintaining a supportive environment.\n\nIn many cases, standing up for oneself and others when someone's behavior is harmful or toxic isn't considered wrong. The author's statement is a clear boundary, which is a valid action. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
