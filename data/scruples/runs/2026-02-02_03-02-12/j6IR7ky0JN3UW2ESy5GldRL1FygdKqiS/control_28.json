Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne is similar in body type to the author and others, and she's been making negative comments about her weight, then dismissing others' compliments. The author finally says that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't talk about it around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and there's a lot of insecurity. Joanne is engaging in negative self-talk and then invalidating others' positive responses. The author's response is to tell her to stop talking about it if she's not going to accept the compliments. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, Joanne is bringing up a sensitive topic, and the author is trying to protect their teammates from the negative self-talk. The author might be standing up for themselves and others by setting a boundary. However, could there be a better way to handle it? Maybe, but the author's intention seems to be to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and the dismissive behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel that she's allowed to express her feelings about her body, even if it's negative. The author's response could be seen as cutting off communication rather than addressing the underlying insecurity. But since Joanne was dismissive of others' input, the author's boundary might be reasonable.\n\nI think the key here is that the author is setting a boundary to protect themselves and their teammates from Joanne's negative and invalidating behavior. While it's possible to approach the situation with more empathy, the author isn't wrong for wanting to stop the cycle. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
