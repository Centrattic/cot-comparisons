Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The scenario is in a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. Joanne keeps expressing her insecurities about her body, and the author gets fed up after she does it multiple times, telling her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and weight isn't part of their sport. So, maybe the author is trying to protect the team environment from negative body talk. Joanne is seeking validation but then dismissing others' input, which can be frustrating. The author's response was a direct call-out, which might come off as harsh, but it's also a way to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's behavior might indicate an underlying issue with body image, which is a serious matter. The author's approach could be seen as dismissive of Joanne's feelings. However, the author isn't criticizing her; they're addressing the behavior of seeking validation and then rejecting input. \n\nIs the author wrong? If the author's intention was to stop the negative self-talk and create a positive environment, maybe not. But the method could have been more empathetic. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author is standing up for the team's dynamic and Joanne was initiating the conversation, the answer might lean towards B (No). But some might argue that the author should have handled it more sensitively. Still, given the context, the author's action is a reasonable boundary setting.\n"
