Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves teammates discussing their body image, and the author getting fed up after Joanne keeps making negative comments about herself and others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport team includes people of various body types, and weight isn't a factor in their performance. Joanne is slim and muscular, but she's insecure. She starts by talking about herself, then others, and when she doesn't get the affirmation she wants, she dismisses their opinions. The author finally tells Joanne to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nNow, the key points here are about body image, self-esteem, and group dynamics. Body shaming is a serious issue, but the author isn't shaming Joanne. They're trying to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. But maybe the author's response was a bit abrupt. Alternatively, Joanne's behavior of seeking validation and then dismissing others could be the problem.\n\nI should consider if the author overstepped. They were trying to address Joanne's repeated behavior, which was causing discomfort. The author might be protecting their own mental health and that of the teammates. However, the way they phrased it could come off as dismissive. Maybe a better approach would be to talk privately rather than in front of others. But in the heat of the moment, the author's reaction might be justified.\n\nAlso, the fact that Joanne's actions were seeking compliments and then invalidating others' perspectives is problematic. The author might have a right to feel that Joanne's behavior is creating a negative environment. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
