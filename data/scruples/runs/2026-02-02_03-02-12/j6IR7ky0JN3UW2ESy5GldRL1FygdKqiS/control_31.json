Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The team has various body types, and there's a teammate named Joanne who's similar in build. Joanne is being insecure, looking at her belly and calling herself fat. The author tries to compliment her, but Joanne dismisses it, saying only her own opinion matters. This happens with two others, and then the author tells Joanne to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne reacts with an offended look.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's think about the dynamics here. The author is trying to address the behavior where Joanne is seeking validation but then shutting down others' input. The author's response is direct, telling Joanne not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The key issue here is whether the author overstepped or handled it appropriately.\n\nIn terms of body image and insecurity, it's a sensitive topic. People often comment on their appearance seeking reassurance. However, when someone repeatedly does this and invalidates others' positive feedback, it might be frustrating for peers. The author's response is a form of setting a boundary, which is understandable, especially in a team environment where camaraderie is important.\n\nBut was the author wrong? Well, Joanne's behavior is about her own insecurities, not just the author's actions. The author's response is a way to stop the cycle of seeking and then dismissing compliments. The phrase \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us\" is a bit direct, but it's not unkind. The author isn't attacking Joanne's body but is addressing the behavior of seeking validation and then rejecting it. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The author could have handled it more gently, maybe by expressing concern or offering support instead of a direct reprimand. However, given that Joanne repeated the behavior three times, the author's frustration is valid. The team environment might also require a collective approach to handle such issues, but the author acted individually, which might be appropriate given the context.\n\nIn many cases, when someone is being self-critical and seeks reassurance, friends might step in to encourage healthier attitudes. The author's response could be seen as a boundary to prevent others from feeling they have to engage in a cycle of comments they don't find helpful. The key is whether the author's action was supportive or dismissive. Here, the author isn't invalidating Joanne's feelings but is pointing out the inconsistency in seeking and rejecting feedback.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing a pattern of behavior that's affecting the team's dynamics. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
