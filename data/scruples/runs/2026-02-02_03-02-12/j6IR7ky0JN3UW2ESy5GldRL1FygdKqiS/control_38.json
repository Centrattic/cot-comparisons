Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't important. The writer's teammate, Joanne, is making negative comments about her body, and the writer tried to reassure her. But after Joanne dismisses their compliments each time, the writer tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Body image issues are common, especially in young women. The writer is trying to support Joanne by offering positive feedback, but Joanne keeps invalidating it by saying only her own opinion matters. That's a pattern\u2014three times over the day. The writer's response is to set a boundary, which is a reasonable step when someone keeps pushing for validation and then rejecting it.\n\nNow, is the writer in the wrong? If the team environment is supportive, but Joanne's behavior is causing distress, the writer's intervention makes sense. The key points are that weight isn't relevant to their sport, and the writer is trying to protect the team's positive environment. The writer's comment is about setting boundaries, not attacking Joanne personally. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
