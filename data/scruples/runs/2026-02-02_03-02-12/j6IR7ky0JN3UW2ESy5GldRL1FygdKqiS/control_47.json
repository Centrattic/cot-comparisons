Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne, who has a similar body type, keeps commenting on her own weight in a negative way, then dismisses the team's reassurances.\n\nSo first, the author tried to be supportive by saying Joanne looks great. But Joanne keeps doing this, and the author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions. The question is whether the author is wrong. \n\nHmm. From what I know about body image issues, especially in sports teams where female athletes might feel pressure, even if their sport isn't weight-dependent. Joanne's behavior sounds like she's seeking validation but then rejecting it, which can be a common sign of low self-esteem. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is about not engaging in the negative self-talk. \n\nIs the author wrong? Maybe not. The author was trying to be kind but also needed to address the repetitive behavior. Joanne's actions might be triggering others, and the author's response is about not being part of the cycle where Joanne undermines her own confidence. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. Instead of cutting off the conversation, perhaps addressing the underlying issue. However, the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The context shows that the author was trying to support Joanne each time, so after repeated dismissals, setting a boundary is understandable. \n\nThe key points are that the author was trying to be supportive, Joanne's behavior was persistent, and the author's final statement was a way to stop the negative cycle. I think the author is not in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
