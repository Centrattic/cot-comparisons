Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't important, and one teammate, Joanne, keeps complaining about her weight and then dismissing others' opinions. The author told her to stop talking about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and there's a lot of insecurity. Joanne is looking in the mirror, poking her belly, and saying she's fat. The author and others try to reassure her, but she keeps doing this, leading the author to finally tell her to stop. \n\nSo the question is whether the author was right to say that. On one hand, the author might be trying to protect Joanne from negative self-talk and prevent others from feeling the same. On the other hand, Joanne might feel that her comments are personal and that the author is being judgmental.\n\nBut the key here is that Joanne is using others for validation and then dismissing their input. The author's response stops the cycle where Joanne is seeking reassurance but then rejecting it, which can be hurtful to others. The author's intention seems good\u2014trying to create a positive environment. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong here. They're setting a boundary to prevent others from feeling like they have to comment on Joanne's weight. It's about creating a supportive atmosphere where body image issues aren't perpetuated. So the answer should be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
