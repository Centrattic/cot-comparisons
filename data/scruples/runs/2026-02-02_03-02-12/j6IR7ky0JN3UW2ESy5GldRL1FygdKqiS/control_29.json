Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne, a teammate with a similar body type, keeps complaining about her weight and then dismissing others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and there's already a lot of insecurity. Joanne approaches others, gets compliments, but then says it doesn't matter. The author steps in after the third time, telling her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The key question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nIn terms of body image issues, it's common for people to seek validation. Joanne might be trying to get reassurance by asking others, then deflecting. The author's response is to set a boundary, which could be seen as necessary to prevent others from feeling they have to give insincere compliments. On the other hand, the author might be shutting down Joanne's self-expression, even if it's negative.\n\nBut the author isn't criticizing Joanne's appearance; they're asking her to stop seeking validation that she then dismisses. It's a boundary to prevent others from feeling they have to engage in a cycle of insincere praise. In a team setting, creating a supportive environment is important. The author's action might help prevent others from feeling pressured to give compliments they don't mean.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might not address Joanne's underlying issues with body image. But in terms of the immediate situation, the author is trying to stop a behavior that could be uncomfortable for others. It's similar to setting boundaries around negative self-talk to foster a healthier team environment.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary to stop a cycle of seeking and dismissing feedback, which can be detrimental to team morale.\n"
