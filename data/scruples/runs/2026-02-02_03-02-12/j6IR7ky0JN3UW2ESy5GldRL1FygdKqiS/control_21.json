Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is on a college sports team where body type isn't a factor. Joanne, a teammate, is similar in body type and often comments on her weight negatively. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it. This happened with two other teammates. Finally, the author tells Joanne that if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nSo, the main issue is about body image and how to handle someone's self-criticism. Joanne is clearly struggling with her self-image. The author's response was to set a boundary after repeated incidents. \n\nIs the author being inconsiderate? Well, Joanne was seeking validation but then invalidating others' support. The author's response is about respecting others' space and not engaging in self-deprecation. It's important to consider that the author might be trying to protect their own mental health and that of others by not reinforcing negative talk.\n\nBut could there be a better approach? Maybe addressing it more privately or offering support instead of a direct confrontation. However, the author did speak up after Joanne repeated the behavior multiple times. The key here is whether the author overstepped or was justified in setting a boundary. \n\nSince the team environment is likely a place where peer support is important, the author's action might be seen as promoting a positive atmosphere. Joanne's behavior could be contributing to a negative environment, and the author is trying to stop it. So, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is setting a boundary against negative self-talk, which is a valid approach to foster a healthier team dynamic.\n"
