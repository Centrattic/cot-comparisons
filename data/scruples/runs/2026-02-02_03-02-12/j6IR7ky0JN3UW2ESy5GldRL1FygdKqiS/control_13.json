Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, they're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. The team has diverse body types. Joanne, a teammate, has a similar body to the author and seems to have body image issues. She starts talking about her weight in a negative way, like saying \"I'm so fat.\" The author responds with a compliment, but Joanne brushes it off, saying that only her opinion matters. This happens three times with different teammates. Finally, the author tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne gets offended.\n\nHmm, the author's main point is that Joanne keeps bringing up her weight and then dismissing others' opinions. The author is trying to set a boundary, right? The problem here is about body image and how to handle it in a group setting. \n\nI think the key points are: Joanne is making negative comments about her weight in a social setting, seeking validation but then invalidating others' positive responses. The author is frustrated and decides to tell her to stop. \n\nIn this context, the author isn't attacking Joanne directly but is setting a boundary to stop the negative behavior. The fact that weight isn't important in their sport adds another layer. The author is probably trying to create a more positive environment. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently, like talking to Joanne privately. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. Since Joanne was the one initiating the conversation each time, the author's response seems like a reasonable boundary. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong here. They addressed the issue after repeated incidents, which shows they tried to be patient. The response was a direct but necessary boundary. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
