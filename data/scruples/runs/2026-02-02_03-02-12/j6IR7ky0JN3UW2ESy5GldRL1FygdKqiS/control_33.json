Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a college athlete who told a teammate to stop talking about her weight after the teammate kept making negative comments and dismissing others' compliments.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sport team has a variety of body types, and weight isn't important for their sport. The teammate (Joanne) keeps complaining about her weight, getting compliments, but then invalidating them by saying only her opinion matters. The author finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the key points here are about body image issues and the appropriate response to someone's negative self-talk. Joanne is engaging in body shaming, which can be harmful, especially in environments where it's not necessary. The author's response was to set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. \n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. Maybe they were trying to protect their own mental health or that of their teammates. Joanne's behavior could be contributing to a toxic environment, especially with others also being affected. The author's comment was direct but perhaps a valid way to address the issue without being supportive of Joanne's negative self-view. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like discussing it privately or supporting Joanne in a different way. However, the author's main point was to stop the negative talk, which is reasonable. Since Joanne was dismissing positive feedback and the author was trying to create a more positive environment, the response might be justified. \n\nConsidering mental health impacts, promoting body positivity is important. If the team is supposed to support each other, the author's action might be seen as positive. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
