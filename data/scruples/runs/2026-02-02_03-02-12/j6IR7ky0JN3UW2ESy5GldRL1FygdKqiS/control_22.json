Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. So, the situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps complaining about her weight and then dismissing others' compliments. The author finally tells her to not talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author's teammates, including Joanne, are young women in a sport where body image might be a sensitive topic, even if weight isn't a performance factor. Joanne's behavior of seeking compliments and then invalidating them could be contributing to a negative environment. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is a common way to handle situations where someone's comments are causing discomfort.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, Joanne was approaching others about her insecurities. When others gave compliments, she dismissed them, which might be hurtful or frustrating. The author, after seeing this happen multiple times, decided to speak up. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. Telling someone to stop talking about it if they don't want feedback is a way to stop the cycle of seeking reassurance and then invalidating it. \n\nIn group settings, especially in teams, it's important to maintain a supportive environment. If Joanne's comments were making others uncomfortable, the author's response could be seen as a way to protect the team's morale. However, the author could have approached it more gently, maybe by expressing concern or offering support instead of a direct reprimand. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the best approach.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's behavior might be a sign of her own insecurities, and the author's response could come off as dismissive of her feelings. But given that Joanne was repeatedly doing this and invalidating others' attempts to be kind, the author's boundary might be necessary. The author's main point is that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. That makes sense logically, but the way it was delivered might have been abrupt.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author was trying to address a recurring issue that was affecting the team's interactions. The author's action, while perhaps a bit direct, was an attempt to stop the negative cycle. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. They were setting a boundary to prevent others from feeling the need to give unwanted or ineffective compliments."
