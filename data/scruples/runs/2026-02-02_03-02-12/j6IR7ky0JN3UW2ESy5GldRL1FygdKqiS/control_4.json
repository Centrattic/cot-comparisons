Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps expressing insecurity about her body, getting compliments, and then dismissing them. The author finally tells her that if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't talk about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't emphasize weight, so body image issues might be less about performance and more about personal insecurities. The author is trying to address Joanne's behavior of seeking compliments but then invalidating them. The author's response is a bit direct\u2014maybe they were frustrated after multiple instances.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, Joanne is struggling with body image, and the author's initial responses (like \"No you aren't! You look great\") might not be effective. But Joanne is repeatedly bringing it up, which could be triggering or uncomfortable for others. The author's final statement is about setting a boundary. \n\nIs it okay to set a boundary here? If Joanne is making others uncomfortable by constantly talking about her weight and invalidating their feedback, the author has the right to speak up. However, the approach might have been harsh. Maybe a more supportive way could have been better, but the intention was to stop the negative behavior. The key is whether the author overstepped. Since the author was trying to address the situation after multiple occurrences, it's more about setting boundaries rather than being in the wrong. So the answer is probably B (No).\n"
