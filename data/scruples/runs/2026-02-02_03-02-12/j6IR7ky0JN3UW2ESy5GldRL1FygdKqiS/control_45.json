Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, context: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Joanne, a teammate with a similar body type, repeatedly comments about her weight, seeks compliments, then dismisses them. The author confronts her, saying if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne gets offended.\n\nThe key points here are about body image and how to handle someone's negative self-talk. The author's intention was to stop the cycle of seeking reassurance and then invalidating it. But the method used was to tell Joanne not to talk about it around them. \n\nIs that the author being in the wrong? Well, Joanne was making herself uncomfortable by repeatedly bringing up her weight and then rejecting others' input. The author's response was to set a boundary. However, the way it was said might have come off as abrupt or dismissive. \n\nBut considering that the author was trying to address the pattern of behavior where Joanne was seeking validation but then rejecting it, the author's intervention could be seen as a way to stop the negative self-talk. However, maybe a better approach would have been to talk to Joanne privately or suggest she focus on health instead of appearance. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. Joanne's behavior was problematic, so the author's response, while maybe not the most tactful, was addressing an issue. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
