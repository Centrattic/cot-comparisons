Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't important. The author is talking about a teammate, Joanne, who repeatedly comments on her own weight and then dismisses the team's opinions.\n\nSo, the author tells Joanne she's not fat, but Joanne says it only matters what she thinks. This happens three times with different teammates. Then the author tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne gets offended.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. Joanne is engaging in negative self-talk about her weight, which the author tries to counter with encouragement. But Joanne is invalidating their input each time, saying it's only about her own opinion. The author finally sets a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want feedback. \n\nIs that the right move? Well, the author isn't bullying Joanne. They were trying to be supportive but it wasn't working. Joanne's behavior might be a sign of body image issues, which are common, especially in sports. But the author is also within their rights to set boundaries. The author isn't attacking Joanne; they're just asking her to stop the self-deprecating talk if she's not going to take their input. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like privately addressing it or encouraging Joanne to seek support. But the author's response seems reasonable given that Joanne was repeatedly dismissive. The author isn't the one with the insecurity here; Joanne is. The author's action was to stop enabling the negative talk, which is a valid boundary.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't. The answer should be B, No. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary after multiple attempts to be supportive. Joanne's behavior is the issue here, not the author's response.\n"
