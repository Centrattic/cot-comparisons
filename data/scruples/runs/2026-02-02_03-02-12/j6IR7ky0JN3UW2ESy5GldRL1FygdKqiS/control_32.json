Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor for performance. The team has diverse body types, which probably means that body image isn't something that affects their sport. So, the author's team isn't in a sport like gymnastics or swimming where weight might be a concern. That's important because if the sport didn't care about weight, then Joanne's comments might be more about personal insecurity rather than performance.\n\nNow, Joanne keeps talking about her weight in a negative way, saying she's fat, even though others compliment her. The author and two other teammates try to reassure her, but Joanne dismisses their opinions each time. The author then tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't talk about it around them. Joanne reacts with offense.\n\nThe key points here are about how to handle someone's insecurity. The author tried to support Joanne by giving positive feedback each time, but Joanne wasn't accepting it and kept bringing up the topic. The author's response is to set a boundary, which makes sense if Joanne's constant negative self-talk is creating a negative environment. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is saying that if she wants to avoid others' input, she shouldn't initiate the conversation.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, Joanne had the choice to not talk about it if she wanted others' opinions to not matter. The author's response was a logical consequence: if you bring up your body image, you might get feedback. The author didn't force the conversation; Joanne did. The author's frustration seems valid if they're trying to avoid contributing to a toxic environment where body shaming is present. Since the sport doesn't require weight management, focusing on body image could be harmful. The author is probably trying to protect their own and others' self-esteem by not engaging further when Joanne is dismissive of support.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their response was a reasonable boundary. Answer B.\n"
