Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. So, the background is they're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne, who has a similar body type, keeps making negative comments about her weight and then invalidates others' compliments by saying only her opinion matters.\n\nThe author tried to compliment her, but Joanne shut it down, and then the author finally told her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weight issues and body image are sensitive topics, especially among young women in sports. The author's teammates, including Joanne, are struggling with body image. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then dismissing it, which might be harmful. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is understandable to avoid contributing to her negative self-image.\n\nBut is the author right to do that? Well, Joanne might feel that she's allowed to express her feelings, and the author's response could come off as dismissive or judgmental. However, the author is trying to protect themselves and others from the cycle of negative self-talk that Joanne is perpetuating. It's a bit of a balance between respecting someone's expression and not enabling harmful behavior.\n\nIn this situation, the author is trying to address the issue directly by setting boundaries, which can be a healthy approach. If Joanne's comments are affecting the team's environment, the author's intervention is justified. However, the way it was done might have been abrupt. Maybe a more constructive approach would be to talk to Joanne privately about the impact of her comments instead of confronting her in front of others. But given the scenario, the author's action was a response to repeated behavior. \n\nSo, considering that the author was trying to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and potential body image issues among teammates, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're taking a stand against harmful behavior, even if the method could be improved.\n"
