Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a college athlete (the author) who confronts a teammate, Joanne, about her repeated comments about her weight. Joanne makes negative self-comments and then dismisses the compliments given by the author and others, leading the author to tell her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't prioritize weight, so body image issues might stem from personal insecurities rather than athletic requirements. Joanne's behavior is about seeking validation but then rejecting others' input, which can be hurtful and create a negative environment.\n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want feedback. This is a way to address the hurtful behavior without enabling it. The key points here are intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the cycle of insecurity and negative self-talk, which is understandable. The impact might be that Joanne felt defensive, but the author was trying to protect the team's positive atmosphere.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it the author's place to intervene? In a team setting, fostering a supportive environment is important. The author is trying to prevent others from being pulled into Joanne's self-criticism. Joanne's behavior could affect team morale, so the author's action is a reasonable boundary.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it more sensitively. Maybe a private conversation first? But the author might feel that Joanne's behavior is affecting others, so a public setting might warrant a direct approach. Also, the author isn't attacking Joanne but setting a boundary for the group.\n\nAnother angle: body image issues are sensitive. The author's approach might come off as dismissive. But given that Joanne keeps pulling others into her self-criticism, the author's response is about self-respect and protecting teammates from unnecessary stress.\n\nIn summary, the author is trying to address a harmful behavior that's affecting the team environment. Their approach is a form of setting boundaries, which is valid. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
