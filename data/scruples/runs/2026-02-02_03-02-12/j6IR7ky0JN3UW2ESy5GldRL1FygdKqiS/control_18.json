Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is about a college sports team where body image isn't important. Joanne keeps making comments about her own weight, getting compliments, and then dismissing them. The author finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it. The author is trying to set a boundary. Is it wrong to set that boundary? Well, Joanne was the one bringing up her insecurities repeatedly. The author's response was a direct way to stop the cycle. \n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently, like a private conversation instead of in front of others. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are intention and the nature of the comment. The author wasn't criticizing Joanne's weight but pointing out that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't ask for it. That's a valid boundary. \n\nAlso, considering the environment, promoting body positivity and reducing negative self-talk is important. The author's action might help prevent others from feeling pressured to comment. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
