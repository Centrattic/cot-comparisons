Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps complaining about her body, getting compliments, then dismissing them by saying only her opinion matters. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Body image issues are common, especially among young women in sports. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then invalidating it, which could be a sign of insecurity. The author, frustrated, speaks up. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author isn't saying something harmful. They're setting a boundary. Joanne initiated the conversation by talking about her body, and the author is telling her to stop if she doesn't want feedback. It's about respect for each other's boundaries. The author isn't bullying; they're responding to repeated behavior that's creating discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author is standing up for themselves, which is a valid action. Joanne's actions might be the problem here, not the author's response. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a sports team, promoting body positivity is important. If others are doing the same, it's a toxic environment. The author's intervention might be a step towards a healthier team culture. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
