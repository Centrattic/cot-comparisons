Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight in a way that seems to be seeking reassurance, then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The team has a variety of body types, so weight isn't an issue in their sport. Joanne is making negative comments about her body, and others are responding with compliments to reassure her. She's doing this to multiple teammates, which might be creating a pattern of seeking validation but then invalidating it.\n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary, saying that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring up the topic. That seems like a reasonable way to handle someone who's being self-deprecating and not accepting positive feedback. The author isn't attacking Joanne's body but is instead trying to stop the negative behavior.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Is commenting on one's body in a team setting okay? Probably not, especially if it's leading to body image issues. The author is trying to create a more positive environment by discouraging such talk. Joanne's reaction was offended, which might indicate she didn't expect that response, but the author's intention was to stop the cycle of negativity and seeking compliments.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
