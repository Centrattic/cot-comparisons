Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a college sports team where one of their teammates, Joanne, keeps making negative comments about her weight. The author and others try to reassure her, but Joanne dismisses their compliments, saying it's only her opinion that matters. Then the author tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want feedback. Joanne gets offended.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and the sport doesn't prioritize weight. So, there's a focus on body image even though it's not relevant to their performance. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which might be a pattern of self-criticism. \n\nThe author's response is to tell her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want opinions. This seems like a boundary being set. But was that the right approach? On one hand, the author is trying to stop the negative talk and put an end to the cycle. On the other hand, Joanne's reaction suggests she felt her self-expression was being shut down. \n\nI should think about the intent. The author probably wants to protect teammates from negative body talk and maybe encourage a healthier environment. But is it their place to tell Joanne to stop? Maybe there's a more supportive way to handle it, like discussing the impact of such comments in private rather than publicly cutting off the conversation. However, the author might not have wanted to address it individually each time. \n\nAnother angle: Joanne's behavior could be a sign of body image issues, which are serious. The author's response might come off as dismissive of those struggles. But if Joanne is repeatedly seeking validation and then dismissing it, it's possible that the author is trying to prevent others from feeling pressured to engage in that cycle. \n\nIs the author being unsupportive by telling Joanne to stop? Or is it a way to set boundaries in a group setting? The key might be whether the author's approach is constructive. Telling her to stop could be seen as avoiding the issue rather than addressing it. However, given that Joanne is in a team where weight isn't important, the author's stance might be about fostering a positive environment.\n\nI think the answer hinges on balancing support for Joanne's feelings with the need to stop negative self-talk. The author's response is direct but might not be the most supportive. However, considering the repeated behavior and the team environment, it's a reasonable way to handle it to prevent ongoing negativity. So, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
