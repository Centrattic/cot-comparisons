Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and Joanne are on a college sports team where body weight doesn't matter. They have various body types, and Joanne has a similar build to the author. Joanne starts talking about her weight in a negative way, saying she's fat, and the author responds positively. But Joanne dismisses the compliments, saying only her own opinion matters. Then she does the same to two more teammates. After the third time, the author tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne gets offended.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overstepped by telling Joanne to stop discussing her weight. Let me think about the context. The team's sport doesn't focus on weight, so maybe Joanne's insecurity isn't related to performance. But she's making herself and others uncomfortable by constantly seeking compliments and then invalidating them. \n\nThe author tried to be supportive at first, but Joanne keeps doing it. The author's response was to set a boundary, which might be necessary to prevent negative body image talk in the team. But some might say that the author shouldn't have cut off Joanne's expression, even if it's negative. However, if Joanne is using others to validate her insecurities and then rejecting their support, the author might be right to address it.\n\nAnother angle: Joanne's behavior could be promoting a toxic environment, making others uncomfortable. The author is trying to stop that by telling her not to talk about it. But maybe the approach was too direct or could have been handled more gently. However, given that Joanne repeated the behavior, the author's response seems reasonable to prevent ongoing negativity.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to address a repeated issue that was making them and others uncomfortable. Setting a boundary is a valid response, especially if the teammate is seeking validation in a way that's not constructive. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
