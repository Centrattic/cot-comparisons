Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The author's teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about her weight in a negative way, like saying she's fat and then dismissing others' compliments. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and there's a lot of insecurity. Joanne is seeking validation by making negative comments, then invalidating others' positive responses. The author's response is to say that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting that boundary? Well, Joanne initiated the conversation each time. The author tried to be supportive by saying \"you look great,\" but Joanne then undermines that. The author's final response is a way to prevent further negative self-talk, which could be harmful, especially in an environment where body image is a concern. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone repeatedly seeks validation through negative self-talk and dismisses kindness, it's fair for others to set limits. The author isn't attacking Joanne but pointing out that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't start the conversation. This seems like a reasonable boundary, especially in a group setting where others might also feel uncomfortable.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it more sensitively. Instead of a direct \"maybe don't talk about it around us,\" perhaps a more empathetic approach. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's intention was to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and protect others from it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author was trying to address a toxic pattern of behavior that could be affecting the team's morale and individual self-esteem. Setting a boundary is a valid response here.\n"
