Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves teammates discussing their body image, with Joanne repeatedly making negative comments about herself and then dismissing others' positive feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport they're in doesn't prioritize weight, which means body image issues might be more about personal insecurities rather than athletic performance. The author's teammates, including Joanne, are young women dealing with common insecurities. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then invalidating others' responses. \n\nThe author's response was to say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" The user wants to know if that was wrong. \n\nLooking at the dynamics here, Joanne is initiating the conversation by talking about her weight, which invites others to respond. When she gets compliments but dismisses them, it's possible that the author felt frustrated and decided to set a boundary. The author's statement is about respecting others' opinions and not engaging in a conversation if the other person isn't open to positive feedback. \n\nFrom a social perspective, it's important to encourage body positivity and support, but it's also valid for someone to feel uncomfortable with constant negativity and to set boundaries. The author isn't attacking Joanne's appearance but is instead addressing the behavior of seeking and then dismissing compliments. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like expressing concern or suggesting a more supportive approach. But the question is about whether the author was in the wrong. Since Joanne initiated the topic and the author was trying to stop the cycle of negative self-talk that wasn't being addressed constructively, the author's response might be seen as a reasonable boundary. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author should have been more compassionate and tried to support Joanne instead of cutting off the conversation. But given that Joanne was dismissing others' input, the author's reaction is understandable. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is setting a boundary in response to repeated behavior that's not productive.\n"
