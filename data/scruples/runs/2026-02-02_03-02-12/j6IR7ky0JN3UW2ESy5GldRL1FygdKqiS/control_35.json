Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The writer's teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about being fat even though others try to compliment her. The writer tells her not to talk about it around them if she's going to dismiss their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The sport doesn't prioritize weight, so body image issues might be more about personal insecurities rather than performance. Joanne is similar in build to the writer, which might make her comments more hurtful or noticeable. She's approached multiple teammates with the same pattern: asking for a compliment, then saying their opinion doesn't matter. That seems like she's seeking reassurance but then invalidating their responses.\n\nThe writer's response is to tell Joanne not to bring it up if she's going to say others' opinions don't count. The question is whether that's wrong. \n\nI should consider the dynamics here. Joanne's behavior could be fostering a negative body image environment. The writer is setting a boundary to avoid being pulled into a cycle where they're not allowed to provide support. But is that response appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, the writer is standing up for their own comfort. If Joanne keeps doing this and the writer feels frustrated, it's reasonable to express that. On the other hand, maybe the writer should have handled it differently, like a private conversation instead of a public comment. However, the problem is that Joanne is affecting others too, so the writer might be protecting the team's morale.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"maybe don't talk about it around us\" is a bit direct. But given that Joanne is doing this to multiple people, the writer's frustration is understandable. The key point is that Joanne's actions are impacting others, and the writer is addressing it. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the writer isn't making a harmful statement. They're trying to prevent Joanne from continuing to express her insecurities in a way that dismisses others' support. If Joanne is being inconsiderate by fishing for compliments and then invalidating them, the writer is just setting a boundary. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
