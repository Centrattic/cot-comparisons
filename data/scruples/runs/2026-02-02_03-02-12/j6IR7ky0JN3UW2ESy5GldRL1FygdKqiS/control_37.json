Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author did the right thing by telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. So the situation is that Joanne keeps saying she's fat, and the author and others give her compliments, but she brushes them off. Then the author tells her not to bring it up if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and weight isn't important for their sport. The teammates are young women dealing with insecurities. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then dismissing others' opinions. The author's response is to set a boundary, which might be about protecting others from her negativity or preventing body image issues from affecting the team.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, Joanne was initiating the conversation, and the author was trying to redirect it. But maybe the author could have handled it differently. However, Joanne was creating a negative environment by constantly focusing on her weight and then invalidating others' feedback. The author's comment was a way to stop the cycle without engaging further. Since the team environment might not be supportive for such self-deprecation, the author's action could be seen as setting a healthy boundary. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
