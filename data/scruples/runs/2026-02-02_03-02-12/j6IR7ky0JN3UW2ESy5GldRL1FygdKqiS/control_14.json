Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling a teammate to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author's teammate, Joanne, repeatedly comments on her own body in a negative way, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne is engaging in body-shaming herself, which can create a negative environment. The author is trying to address this by setting a boundary. The key points are: Joanne's behavior is about self-image, the author is trying to protect the team's atmosphere, and the author's response was a direct boundary.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is the author being too harsh? Or is it a valid response to prevent toxic behavior? Since the sport doesn't prioritize weight, the focus on body image is unnecessary. The author's teammates are also being pulled into this, which could lead to a culture of insecurity. By setting a boundary, the author is promoting a positive environment. Joanne's response of being offended might indicate she felt challenged, but the author's intention was to stop the cycle of self-criticism. The author isn't attacking Joanne but addressing the behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
