Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps complaining about her weight and then dismissing others' compliments. The author confronts her after she does this to three people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. The team has diverse body types, so there's probably a lot of insecurity. Joanne is looking in the mirror, poking her belly, and saying she's fat. Others try to compliment her, but she brushes it off. The author finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne seems offended.\n\nThe key here is whether the author was right to confront her. The author's intention was to stop the negative talk about weight, which can create a toxic environment. By telling Joanne to stop bringing it up, the author is trying to address the repeated behavior that's causing issues. \n\nBut wait, the author might have handled it differently. Maybe a more gentle approach, like discussing it privately, would have been better. However, Joanne was doing this to multiple people, so the author's response was in response to a pattern. The author isn't attacking Joanne's body but is setting a boundary about how topics are discussed.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne was expressing her own feelings, and the author cut her off. But if Joanne is seeking validation and then dismissing others, it's a cycle that can affect the team's morale. The author's action could be seen as standing up for the team's well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The answer depends on intent and the impact. The author's intent was to stop the cycle of insecurity and negative talk. The impact was that Joanne felt offended, but maybe that's a necessary consequence to change the behavior. Since the author was addressing a repeated issue and not just one instance, it's more about creating a respectful environment. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
