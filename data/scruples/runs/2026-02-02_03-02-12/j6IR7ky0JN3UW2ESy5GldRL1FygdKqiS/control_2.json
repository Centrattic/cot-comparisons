Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is on a college sports team where weight isn't important. Their teammate Joanne keeps talking about her weight negatively, like saying she's fat, and then dismissing others' compliments. The author finally tells Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't care about weight, so there's no performance-related reason for Joanne's comments. The author is trying to prevent body image issues from affecting the team. Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The author's response was a bit direct, but is it wrong?\n\nThe key points are: Joanne's behavior might be promoting a negative body image or encouraging others to focus on their weight. The author is setting a boundary to stop the negative talk. Even though Joanne was offended, the author is protecting the team's well-being. Maybe the author's approach was a bit abrupt, but the intention is to create a positive environment. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing an issue that could affect the whole team.\n"
