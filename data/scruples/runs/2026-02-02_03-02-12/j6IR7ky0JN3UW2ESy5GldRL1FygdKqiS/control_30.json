Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. The teammate, Joanne, keeps commenting on her own weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally says that if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't talk about it around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and there's existing insecurity. Joanne's behavior is about seeking validation but then invalidating the responses. The author's response is to set a boundary, stopping the cycle. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, Joanne was the one initiating the conversation about her weight each time. The author was trying to prevent negative self-talk and maybe protect the team environment from such comments. The author's response seems like a reasonable boundary, especially since Joanne was doing it multiple times. The key here is that the author is not attacking Joanne directly but is addressing the behavior. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like having a private conversation instead of in the moment. But the question is about being in the wrong. Publicly calling out the behavior might come across as harsh, but the author's intention was to stop the unnecessary comments. Since the team environment is about supporting each other, the author's action might be seen as promoting positivity. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they were addressing a recurring issue caused by Joanne. The author's response was a way to set a boundary in a group setting where others might be affected by the negative self-talk.\n"
