Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. The author's teammate, Joanne, repeatedly comments negatively on her body, seeking reassurance but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring up the topic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, and there's existing insecurity. Joanne's behavior seems to be a common pattern: making negative self-comments, getting compliments, then invalidating them. The author's response is a direct boundary setting. \n\nThe key points here are about respect and boundaries. Joanne is engaging in behavior that might be draining for others, especially in a group setting. The author isn't judging Joanne's weight but is instead setting a boundary about how they want to be treated. The author's statement is about mutual respect\u2014don't ask for opinions if you don't want them. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, Joanne initiated the conversation by talking about her weight. The author tried to be supportive initially, but after repeated instances, setting a boundary is reasonable. The author didn't attack Joanne's body but pointed out the inconsistency in her behavior. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have handled it more privately or with more tact. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Intentionally setting a boundary isn't wrong. The author's action was a response to Joanne's repeated behavior, which might be affecting the team's dynamics. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They maintained their boundaries without being mean, and it's reasonable to ask someone to stop seeking validation if they're going to dismiss it.\n"
