Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they were right to tell Joanne to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, the background: the author is a college athlete on a team where weight doesn't affect performance. The team has diverse body types, and there's a lot of insecurity, especially among the women. Joanne, a teammate with a similar body type to the author, is complaining about her weight. The author tries to compliment her, but Joanne dismisses it, saying only her own opinion matters. This happens with two other teammates as well. Finally, the author tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne seems offended.\n\nSo, the main points are: Joanne is repeatedly talking about her weight in a negative way, seeking compliments but then dismissing them. The author, after seeing this multiple times, tells Joanne to stop. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Joanne is expressing her body image issues, which can be a sensitive topic. The author might be trying to be supportive by giving compliments, but Joanne isn't accepting them. The author's comment could be seen as shutting down a conversation that Joanne might need to have, especially if she's struggling with insecurity. Maybe the author could have handled it more compassionately, like suggesting a private conversation or encouraging Joanne to talk to someone else if she's feeling this way.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also part of a team environment where constant negative self-talk about weight might be affecting others. If Joanne is repeatedly bringing up her weight and dismissing others' reassurances, it could be contributing to a negative atmosphere. The author's response might be a way to set boundaries to protect the team's morale, especially since the sport isn't about weight. The author could feel that Joanne isn't respecting others' attempts to be kind, so they're standing up for themselves and possibly others by saying that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nBut is the author at fault? Maybe not. The author tried to be supportive first. After multiple instances, the author decided to address the issue directly. It's possible that Joanne's behavior was unintentionally creating a tense environment, and the author was within their right to speak up. However, the way they did it might have come off as abrupt or insensitive, which is why Joanne was offended. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is whether the author overstepped. The author's action was a response to Joanne's repeated behavior, which could be seen as a way to maintain a positive team dynamic. However, the author might have handled it better by approaching Joanne privately or discussing it with the team. But in the context given, the author's statement seems like a reasonable boundary after Joanne's repeated dismissiveness. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong). The author was trying to address a pattern of behavior that could be harmful, and setting that boundary is valid, even if the execution could be improved. The author isn't at fault here.\n"
