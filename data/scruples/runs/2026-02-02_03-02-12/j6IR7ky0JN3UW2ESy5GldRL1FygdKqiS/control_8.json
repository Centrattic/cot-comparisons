Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne, who's similar in build, keeps complaining about her weight. The author tries to reassure her, but Joanne dismisses the feedback, saying only her own opinion matters. This happens with two other teammates too. Finally, the author tells Joanne to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions, which makes Joanne look offended.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong? Let's consider the perspective. The author is standing up for themselves and their teammates by setting a boundary. Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidating others' opinions. The author isn't criticizing Joanne's weight; they're just asking her to stop sharing it if she doesn't want feedback. That seems reasonable because constant complaints can be draining, especially if the person isn't open to positive responses.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it more gently. But the key here is that Joanne was repeatedly doing this, so the author's response was a way to protect their own mental health and that of the team. The main issue is whether the author overstepped. Since Joanne's behavior was seeking validation while dismissing others, the author's boundary is justified. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
