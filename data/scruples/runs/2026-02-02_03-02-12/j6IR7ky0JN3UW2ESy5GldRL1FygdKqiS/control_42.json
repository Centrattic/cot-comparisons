Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe background is that they're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. The team has diverse body types. Joanne, who has a similar body type to the author, is making negative comments about her weight, like saying \"I'm so fat.\" The author tries to compliment her, but Joanne dismisses it, saying only her own opinion matters. This happens with two other teammates too. The author then tells Joanne that if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it around them. Joanne gets offended.\n\nSo, the author is standing up for themselves and others by saying that if Joanne is going to seek validation but then dismiss it, maybe she shouldn't bring it up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a boundary perspective, the author is trying to set a limit on what's acceptable. Joanne's behavior is potentially body-shaming or encouraging insecurity, and the author is pushing back. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is addressing the behavior. The author's response seems reasonable because Joanne is using others to validate her insecurities but then invalidating their input. The author is pointing out the inconsistency and setting a boundary. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it more gently, but the core issue is about setting boundaries. In a team environment, especially with athletes, body image can be a sensitive topic, and the author is trying to create a positive space. Joanne's actions might be harmful, so the author's response is justified. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're addressing the behavior and setting boundaries, not being cruel. Joanne's reaction is about being offended, but the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
