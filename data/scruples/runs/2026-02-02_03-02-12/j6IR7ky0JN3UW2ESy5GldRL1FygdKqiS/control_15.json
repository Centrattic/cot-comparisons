You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe background is that the author and their teammates are on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. They have various body types. Joanne, a teammate, has a similar body to the author and is slim with muscular legs. There's a lot of insecurity among the 18-22-year-old women about their looks. \n\nIn the scenario, Joanne looks at herself in the mirror, pokes her belly, frowns, and says she's fat. The author tells her she doesn't look fat and that she looks great. Joanne responds that the author is just being nice, and that only her own opinion matters. This pattern repeats with two more teammates, each time Joanne seeks a compliment but then dismisses their opinion. Finally, the author tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne gets offended and says she was just talking.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. Joanne was making negative comments about herself in a public setting (practice), which might be causing others to feel uncomfortable or insecure too. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it. Then the author set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want feedback. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting that boundary? Well, when someone repeatedly brings up their insecurities in a group that might be sensitive to it, others might feel they need to set limits to protect their own mental health. The author isn't being mean; they're saying that if Joanne doesn't want input, she shouldn't ask for it. That seems like a reasonable boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's behavior might stem from her own insecurities. Maybe she's not aware that her comments affect others. The author tried to be kind initially but then decided to address the behavior. It's possible that the author could have approached it differently, but the action of setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that Joanne did this to multiple teammates suggests a pattern. The author isn't the only one who might feel this way, so their response is a collective concern. The author isn't attacking Joanne but setting a limit on how to discuss body image in their group. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions seem justified. They are trying to create a positive environment where people don't feel pressured to comment on each other's bodies. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
