Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't important. The author's teammate, Joanne, keeps talking about how she's fat, even though the team has various body types. The author tells Joanne she's not fat, Joanne dismisses it, and then the author tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. Joanne was making negative comments about her body, which can create a toxic environment. The author tried to be supportive but Joanne kept doing it. So the author's response was to tell her to stop talking about it. That seems like they're trying to protect the team's positive atmosphere. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it differently. Maybe they should have talked to Joanne privately first or encouraged her to focus on something else instead of cutting off the conversation. But Joanne was being defensive each time, so the author might have felt it was necessary to set a boundary. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a team environment, fostering body positivity is important. If Joanne is constantly bringing up her weight, it could make others uncomfortable or promote insecurity. The author's action might be seen as standing up for the team's well-being. \n\nI think the key points are whether the author's response was respectful but firm. They didn't attack Joanne, just asked her to stop talking about it. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
