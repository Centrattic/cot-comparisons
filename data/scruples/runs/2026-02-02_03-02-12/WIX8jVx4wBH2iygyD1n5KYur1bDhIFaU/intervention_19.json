One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is in a relationship with a 20-year-old girlfriend. They had a friend, Annie, who is 22 and in a long-term relationship, come over for drinks before a party. Another friend bailed, so they ended up not going to the party and stayed in the author's room to watch TV and smoke. They fell asleep together in the author's bed. The girlfriend was at a concert with her friend and didn't come home that night.\n\nThe next morning, the author told his girlfriend about Annie sleeping in his bed. She didn't react immediately, but later sat him down to talk about it being inappropriate. The girlfriend mentioned previous instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with his hair or holding his hand at a festival when the girlfriend was behind. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie's name, but not seriously. \n\nSo, the author is asking if he's in the wrong for not thinking the sleepover was a big deal, and if he's justified in feeling like his girlfriend overreacted, possibly affecting his friendship with Annie. \n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's perspective. In a relationship, even if the author didn't have ill intentions, the fact that Annie stayed in his bed could be uncomfortable or seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend might feel insecure or jealous, especially if they've discussed threesomes before, even in a joking manner. Even if it was a couple of Js (marijuana), the environment and the actions might have led the girlfriend to perceive the situation as more intimate than it was. \n\nThen, the author's responsibility. He didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't check in with his girlfriend. The key here is communication. Even if it was an accident, the author should have considered his girlfriend's feelings and maybe avoided the situation or talked to her first. Not asking is a problem because it shows a lack of consideration for her boundaries. \n\nThe girlfriend brought up past behaviors that the author didn't notice. That could mean he hasn't been as attentive as he could be. The conversation about threesomes is a red flag. Even if it was a joke, mentioning specific people might have planted a seed in the girlfriend's mind. So, the author might have had his own part in making the girlfriend feel uneasy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong. He thought the sleepover was innocent. But in relationships, it's about how it's perceived and the trust between partners. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's uncomfortable, and the author should respect that. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for the sleepover? Maybe not in terms of actual actions, but in terms of not considering the girlfriend's feelings and not setting clear boundaries with Annie. The mention of Annie in the threesome joke could also be a contributing factor. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend and there's a history of joking about threesomes with Annie. Even if he didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend's feelings are important, and he should have been more mindful of her perspective. The fact that he didn't notice her discomfort before also shows a lack of attention to her emotional state. Therefore, he's partially at fault for not addressing potential insecurities and for the sleepover happening without her knowledge.\n"
