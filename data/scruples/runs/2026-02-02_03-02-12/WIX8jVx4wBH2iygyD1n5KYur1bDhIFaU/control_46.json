One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy (21M) having a sleepover with his female friend (22F) without informing his girlfriend (20F). They ended up falling asleep together in his room. The girlfriend is upset about this, especially because they had discussed threesomes hypothetically in the past, and the friend in question had previously crossed boundaries by holding his hand and playing with his hair when the girlfriend was nearby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and communication are key. Even though the guy didn't have intentions, the fact that he didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her insecurities, especially given their past conversation about threesomes. Even if it was just a hypothetical, bringing up that conversation might have made her feel like her boundaries were being challenged.\n\nOn the author's side, he didn't initiate the physical interactions with Annie but didn't notice her discomfort. He also didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a point where he should have been more proactive in ensuring his girlfriend felt secure. The fact that they had discussed threesomes hypothetically might have planted a seed of doubt in the girlfriend's mind, making her reaction more intense.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. The main issues here are communication and boundaries. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which is a big no-no in relationships. Even if the situation was innocent, the lack of communication can lead to mistrust. Also, he didn't realize that his friend's actions (like holding his hand) were making his girlfriend uncomfortable. While he might not have intended harm, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. \n\nHowever, the author's actions weren't malicious. He didn't have a romantic intent, and he informed his girlfriend the next day. But the key point is whether he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries before the sleepover. In a relationship, being considerate of each other's feelings is crucial. The fact that they had a hypothetical conversation about threesomes might have added to the girlfriend's anxiety, but the author's responsibility is to be mindful of how his actions could be perceived, especially when it comes to other people involved in their social circle.\n\nThe author is now feeling guilty and is hyper-aware, which might affect his friendship with Annie. The question is whether he is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the lack of communication is a red flag, the author might have made a mistake in not being more considerate and communicative. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author didn't initiate the interactions, but the act of not informing his girlfriend is still a significant oversight. Therefore, he's partially at fault.\n"
