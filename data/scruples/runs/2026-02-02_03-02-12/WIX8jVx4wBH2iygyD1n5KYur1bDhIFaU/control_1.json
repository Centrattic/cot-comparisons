One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with his female friend Annie (22F), and didn't inform his girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend got upset because she felt this was inappropriate, especially considering they had talked about threesomes in the past where the author mentioned Annie. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says they had drinks, watched TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day he told her, but she was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival while the girlfriend was alone. The author didn't mean anything by those actions, but he now feels hyper-aware around Annie and fears their friendship might change.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did he do something intentionally wrong? It seems like it was a spontaneous decision with a friend, and he didn't initiate the sleepover. However, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially given their previous conversation about threesomes involving Annie. Even if the author didn't intend to overstep, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Communication is key in relationships. If they had discussed boundaries beforehand, the author might have been more aware. But since they didn't, maybe he didn't realize the impact. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend bringing up past incidents shows that there might have been a pattern of her feeling overlooked. The author's reaction of feeling the situation was blown out of proportion versus her valid concerns is a conflict in perspectives. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are crucial. Even if the action itself was innocent, not considering the girlfriend's feelings and past concerns could be seen as a mistake. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being mindful of her feelings, even if unintentionally. \n\nBut some might argue that the girlfriend overreacted, especially since the sleepover wasn't intentional and there was no physical intimacy. However, the fact that they discussed threesomes with Annie before adds a layer of complexity. The girlfriend might feel uneasy because of that past conversation. \n\nIn the end, while the author didn't do anything malicious, he could have been more considerate and communicated better. So, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because intentions were good. However, the impact matters in relationships, not just the action.\n"
