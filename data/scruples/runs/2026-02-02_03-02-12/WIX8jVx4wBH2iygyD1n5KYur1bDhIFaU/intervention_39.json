One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves the author's friend, Annie, falling asleep in his bed after a party. The girlfriend later gets upset about this and brings up past incidents where Annie might have overstepped, like holding his hand at a festival. The author claims he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend, but he's feeling that she's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. The author didn't have any intention of doing anything wrong, but maybe he failed to recognize his girlfriend's discomfort. The key points here are communication and boundaries. Even though he didn't intend harm, the fact that Annie slept in his bed could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the girlfriend felt it crossed a line. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend beforehand, which might have been a mistake. Relationships often require being mindful of each other's feelings, even in seemingly small actions.\n\nThen there's the part where the author mentioned to his girlfriend that Annie would be a good choice for a threesome. Even if it was just a joke or exploratory conversation, that might have contributed to her hurt feelings. It's possible she took that comment more seriously than he intended, leading to her being more sensitive about the sleepover.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he didn't do anything intentional, and he didn't realize how his actions affected her. But in a committed relationship, being aware of the partner's feelings is important. He might not be \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but he could be at fault for not being considerate enough or failing to communicate properly. The fact that he didn't ask his girlfriend beforehand and later didn't notice her discomfort suggests that he might have overlooked some important relationship dynamics.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction might also be a bit extreme if the author had no malicious intent. The situation could hinge on how both parties value trust and communication. If the author wasn't trying to be disrespectful, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is more about past insecurities rather than the specific incident. In that case, the author might not be entirely at fault, but he could still have done better in terms of communication.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong in a strict sense, but he could have handled things differently to avoid hurting his girlfriend. The answer might lean towards B (No), but there's a nuance where he's not entirely free from responsibility for not being more communicative.\n"
