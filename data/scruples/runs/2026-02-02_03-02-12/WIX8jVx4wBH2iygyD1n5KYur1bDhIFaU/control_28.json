One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sleepover with their friend Annie, who's 22 and in a relationship. The girlfriend found out and got upset. The key points are the sleepover, Annie being in the author's bed, and a prior conversation where the author mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and boundaries are important. Even if the author didn't have intentions, the fact that Annie was in his bed without the girlfriend's knowledge could be seen as crossing a line. The girlfriend might feel insecure or threatened, especially if there was a previous discussion about threesomes involving Annie. Even if they joked about it, the author's comment might have planted a seed of doubt in the girlfriend's mind.\n\nThen there's the part about Annie's behavior, like playing with the author's hair and holding hands at a festival while the girlfriend was alone. The author didn't notice these things bothered his girlfriend, but they might have been building up her discomfort. Not acknowledging or addressing these small boundary crossings could contribute to her feeling hurt or ignored.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and they didn't have any sexual intent. They mentioned that Annie fell asleep in their room after a party. However, the author's past comment about threesomes with Annie is a significant factor here. Even if it was a joke, it's a red flag for the girlfriend, showing that the author might not be fully respecting her boundaries or the exclusivity of their relationship.\n\nThe author is now worried about their friendship with Annie being affected. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the sleepover and prior comments violated the girlfriend's trust. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before having Annie over, which might be a breach of the trust they've built. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the lack of communication and the prior joke about threesomes could make the girlfriend feel insecure.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they didn't have malicious intent, but they did contribute to the girlfriend's discomfort through their actions and words. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions, though innocent, disregarded the girlfriend's feelings. But since the girlfriend is the one who brought it up and it's her feelings we're considering, the author could be seen as partially at fault for not being more aware of how their actions affected her.\n"
