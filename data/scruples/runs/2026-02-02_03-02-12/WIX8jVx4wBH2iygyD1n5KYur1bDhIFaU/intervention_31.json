One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with their female friend, who ended up sleeping in his bed, while their girlfriend found out and was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author didn't invite their girlfriend to the sleepover, but she wasn't nearby at the time. The friend in question, Annie, is in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend was upset about the sleepover and brought up past instances where Annie might have overstepped, like holding hands or playing with hair. The girlfriend also mentioned a previous conversation where they joked about having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now the author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Considering the girlfriend's perspective, it's understandable she would feel insecure. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the act of having another girl sleep in his bed could be seen as crossing boundaries in a relationship. Also, the mention of joking about threesomes involving Annie might have triggered her insecurities. However, the author didn't initiate the sleepover; Annie came over, and they ended up there together. The author didn't have sexual intent. \n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. The author didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend. Even if there was no intent, not thinking about her feelings is a mistake. The girlfriend raised valid concerns, and the author should have been more mindful of her feelings. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, especially since the author didn't do anything intentionally. \n\nThe line between being considerate and overreacting is thin here. The author might not be in the wrong for the actual actions but could be in the wrong for not considering how it would affect his girlfriend. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also influenced by past jokes about threesomes, which complicates things. Ultimately, both might have valid points, but the question is about the author's responsibility. Since the author didn't act with malice but failed to consider his girlfriend's feelings, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But in a relationship, partners should communicate their boundaries. The author didn't set clear boundaries, which led to this conflict. So, perhaps he's partially to blame. But the girlfriend's reaction might be an overreaction. It's a tricky situation. I think the answer is B (No), but with the nuance that both could improve communication.\n"
