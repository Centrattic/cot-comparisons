One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (a guy) having a sleepover with his female friend Annie (22F), while his girlfriend (20F) was at a concert with a friend. They ended up in his room, not going to the party, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was upset about this, partly because of past conversations about potential threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard relationship norms. Having a close friend sleep over in the same bed could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the girlfriend is uncomfortable. Even if the author didn't intend anything wrong, the act of not informing his girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't mean to cross them. \n\nAlso, the fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly and the author mentioned Annie might have triggered the girlfriend's insecurity. The key issue here is communication. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which is a big oversight. In relationships, transparency is crucial. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the lack of communication could be the main problem. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that the situation was a setup for potential issues. The hyperawareness the author now feels about his friendship with Annie is a consequence of not managing expectations and communication with his girlfriend. \n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, the failure to communicate and consider his girlfriend's feelings when making plans with a close friend likely places some responsibility on him. The girlfriend's reaction, though maybe intense, is rooted in feeling overlooked and insecure. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not checking in with his girlfriend before the sleepover and not being more aware of her feelings in their previous interactions with Annie.\n"
