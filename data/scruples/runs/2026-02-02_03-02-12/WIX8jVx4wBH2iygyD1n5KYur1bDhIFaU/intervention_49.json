One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend is upset because he had a sleepover with his female friend, who fell asleep in his bed. The author didn't think it was a big deal initially, but the girlfriend took it seriously, especially because of previous comments about threesomes where the author mentioned this friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: the author didn't initiate anything with the friend, just had a sleepover after a friend bailed. The girlfriend was at a concert with her own friend. The author didn't ask the girlfriend about the sleepover. The girlfriend is upset because the friend had crossed boundaries before, like holding hands and playing with hair. The author mentioned the friend in a hypothetical threesome conversation, which the girlfriend now brings up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's perspective is that the friend overstepped, and the author not noticing that she was bothered is part of the issue. The author feels the situation was blown out of proportion. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't consult his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust, even if unintentional. The girlfriend's past concerns about the friend's behavior (holding hands, etc.) might indicate a pattern that the author should have been more aware of. Also, the mention of the threesome joke adds another layer because it might have triggered the girlfriend's insecurities even if it was just playful talk.\n\nHowever, the author didn't have any intention of being unfaithful or disrespectful. The sleepover was with a close friend, and the friend fell asleep in the bed. The author might not have realized how sensitive the situation was for his girlfriend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, not considering the girlfriend's feelings and not seeking her consent could be seen as a mistake. On the other, if the author truly didn't mean anything by it and the girlfriend is projecting past issues, maybe she's overreacting. But in relationships, even if it's not malicious, not being aware of the partner's feelings can be an oversight. The fact that the author had mentioned the friend in a hypothetical scenario might have contributed to the girlfriend's anxiety. \n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both sides. However, according to the options, the answer is either A (yes) or B (no). Since the author didn't act with intent to hurt, but maybe lacked communication, the more balanced view might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue for A. However, given the context, the answer is likely B.\n"
