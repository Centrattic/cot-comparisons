One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (21M) having a sleepover with his female friend Annie (22F) in his room without informing his girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend was upset about it and brought up past incidents where Annie had physical contact with the author, which he didn't see as a problem. The key points here are communication, boundaries in a relationship, and the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nFirst, the author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover. Even if it was just a couple of friends hanging out and falling asleep, not informing a partner can be a big deal. Relationships often require transparency, especially in matters that could be perceived as potentially intimate. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate for Annie to be in the same bed, which is a reasonable concern for many people.\n\nThen, there's the part where the author and his girlfriend had jokingly talked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Even if it was just a hypothetical conversation, bringing up someone's name in that context might have made the girlfriend feel uncomfortable or like there was an unspoken agreement or interest. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from a mix of past behavior and her own insecurities, which the author didn't notice. \n\nThe author didn't intend to cross any boundaries, but his lack of awareness of how his actions affected his girlfriend is a problem. In a relationship, it's important to be sensitive to your partner's feelings and to communicate openly. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to address this and the author hadn't considered her perspective until then points to a breakdown in communication. \n\nAlso, the author now feels hyper-aware of his actions around Annie and worries about their friendship. This suggests that the girlfriend's concerns had a valid impact on the relationship dynamics. While the author didn't do anything malicious, the lack of communication and consideration for the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as a mistake. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong in terms of intent, but in terms of how it affected his girlfriend and the lack of communication, he might share some responsibility. However, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as overblown, especially if the friendship with Annie is important to the author. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the author should have communicated the sleepover and considered his girlfriend's feelings more. Since the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and the author didn't consider her perspective, the author might be partially at fault. But the problem is also about her overreacting based on a hypothetical conversation. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he didn't intend harm, but he could have handled communication better.\n"
