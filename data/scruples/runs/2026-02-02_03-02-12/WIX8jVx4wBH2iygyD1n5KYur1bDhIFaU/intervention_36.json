One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who had a sleepover with a female friend, and his girlfriend got upset. The author is wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy and his girlfriend have been together for two years. He had a female friend (Annie) over to watch TV, smoke, and they fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes and the guy mentioned Annie. The girlfriend feels that Annie crosses boundaries, like holding hands or playing with hair in front of her. The author now feels his girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the main points are: the sleepover, the previous joke about threesomes involving Annie, and the girlfriend's sensitivity about Annie's behavior.\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics here. In relationships, boundaries are important. Even if the guy didn't do anything intentionally wrong, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The fact that they had discussed threesomes in a joking manner might have led the girlfriend to feel insecure. The sleepover, even if accidental, could be seen as a breach of those boundaries, even if not on purpose.\n\nBut then, the guy didn't initiate the sleepover. They fell asleep while watching TV and smoking. That seems pretty normal. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by past conversations. If they had discussed threesomes with Annie in a lighthearted way, the girlfriend might have felt that he was more open to the idea, which could make her feel insecure when Annie is around.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned Annie crossing boundaries before, like holding hands and playing with hair. The guy might not have realized how those actions affected her. So, his lack of awareness could be part of the problem. He might not have been intentionally dismissive, but not acknowledging her feelings about Annie's actions could contribute to her feeling upset now.\n\nThe key here is communication. The guy didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which she might have expected. If they had discussed boundaries beforehand, this situation might have been avoided. The girlfriend's reaction is partly about feeling that he didn't consider her feelings in his actions with Annie, even if they were accidental.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy didn't have any malicious intent. He and Annie fell asleep, and he didn't mean to hurt his girlfriend. But in relationships, it's important to consider how your actions might affect your partner, even if you don't intend to. The fact that the girlfriend brought up past issues with Annie crossing boundaries suggests that this wasn't a one-time thing, and the guy might have consistently underestimated how she felt about Annie's behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether not considering her feelings in this situation makes him in the wrong. If the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with Annie's actions and he didn't take that into account, then maybe he's at least partially responsible for not being more mindful. Even if the sleepover was accidental, the lack of communication and consideration could be a point against him.\n\nHowever, if the girlfriend is overreacting because of past jokes about threesomes, maybe she's projecting. But in relationships, partners have the right to set boundaries, and the guy should respect those. Even if the jokes were lighthearted, if they made her uncomfortable, he should be more careful about his actions around Annie.\n\nIn summary, while the guy didn't do anything intentionally wrong, his lack of awareness about his girlfriend's feelings regarding Annie's behavior and not communicating with her before the sleepover might place some responsibility on him. Therefore, he could be considered partially in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries as much as he should have.\n"
