One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who had a friend over, they both fell asleep in his bed, and his girlfriend got upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend in question is in a long-term relationship, which might matter. The man didn't invite his girlfriend, but he had a friend over. They were drinking, watching TV, and smoked something. Then they fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert and later found out. She felt it was inappropriate, especially because the friend had previously crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair or holding his hand when she was alone. Also, there's a past joke about threesomes where the guy mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend brought up as a contributing factor.\n\nSo, the guy didn't do anything intentionally, but the girlfriend felt uncomfortable. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From an objective standpoint, sharing a bed with a friend of the opposite sex when the girlfriend is not present could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if unintentional. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling neglected or insecure, which is valid. However, the guy didn't have ulterior motives. The fact that they had previous conversations about threesomes might have made the girlfriend more sensitive.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the act itself is wrong. If the guy didn't have any intention beyond friendship, maybe it's not his fault. However, in relationships, partners have expectations about boundaries. If the girlfriend felt that this crossed a line, it's important for the guy to acknowledge her feelings even if he didn't mean harm. The problem is that he didn't consider her perspective beforehand, which might be a flaw in communication rather than an intentional wrong.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the action (sleeping in the same bed) is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's a breach of trust, while others see it as an innocent mistake. The guy's lack of awareness about his girlfriend's feelings is a point against him, but if he didn't act with malice, maybe it's not his fault. The fact that he didn't initiate the sleepover but ended up there with a friend might mitigate it. However, the cumulative effect of past behaviors (like the hand-holding) and the mention of threesomes could have led the girlfriend to feel insecure, which the guy should have been more attuned to.\n\nSo, considering all factors, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but he could be at fault for not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries and not being more communicative. However, the girlfriend's overreaction might stem from her own insecurities exacerbated by past jokes. The answer might be B (No) because the act was unintentional, but the situation shows a communication breakdown. Alternatively, A (Yes) could be the case if the act itself is considered a boundary violation regardless of intent.\n"
