One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, without telling his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset because she felt it was inappropriate, especially since they had joked about threesomes before and he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't inform his girlfriend. Even though the sleepover was accidental (they fell asleep after drinking and smoking), the lack of communication might be an issue. The girlfriend's main points are about feeling that Annie crosses boundaries and the previous conversation about threesomes. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could lead to misunderstandings. Even if it was unintentional, not checking in with his partner might be seen as a lack of consideration. The girlfriend's reaction, while possibly overblown, is valid because her comfort and boundaries matter in a relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly might have made the situation more sensitive. The girlfriend could feel that the author's past comments made the sleepover with Annie more problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. He thought nothing of the sleepover and didn't mean to hurt his girlfriend. However, relationships require awareness of each other's feelings and proactive communication. The author's lack of awareness about how his actions affected his girlfriend might be where he's at fault. \n\nSo, while the author didn't act with bad intentions, the failure to communicate and consider his girlfriend's feelings could mean he's partially in the wrong. The girlfriend's perspective is valid in that she felt disrespected or uncomfortable. The answer might be A (Yes) because the author didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and didn't communicate, even if it wasn't intentional.\n"
