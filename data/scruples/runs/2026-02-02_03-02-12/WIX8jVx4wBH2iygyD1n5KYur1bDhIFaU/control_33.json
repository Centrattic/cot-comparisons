One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a friend, Annie, sleep over in their bed after a party, and the author didn't inform their girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about this and brought up past instances where Annie might have overstepped, like holding the author's hand when the girlfriend was nearby. The author mentioned they had joked about threesomes involving Annie, which the girlfriend found relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and Annie were friends, and they ended up falling asleep together after a night of drinking. The author didn't think it was a big deal at first but didn't tell the girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset because she felt the situation was inappropriate, especially considering the past jokes about threesomes. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about the friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, from the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that even though the author didn't intend anything wrong, the act of having another person in his bed without informing her could be a breach of trust. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and not communicating about such things can lead to jealousy or insecurity. The past jokes about threesomes might have made her more sensitive to this situation, thinking that the author is more open to those scenarios than she is comfortable with.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything with Annie and didn't realize how much it bothered the girlfriend. The author might not see the issue since there was no physical contact beyond sleeping together, and they considered Annie a close friend. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's expressing her feelings about boundaries and trust. The fact that the author didn't check in with her about the sleepover could be seen as neglecting her feelings.\n\nThe key points are communication and awareness of the girlfriend's boundaries. The author might not have done anything intentionally wrong, but the lack of communication and not considering the girlfriend's perspective could be where they're in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe intense, is about her emotional needs and trust in the relationship. The author's responsibility is to acknowledge her feelings and work on communication, even if they don't see the issue the same way.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate with their girlfriend about the sleepover and didn't take into account her feelings about boundaries, especially given the previous jokes about threesomes. The author's failure to consider how this might affect their girlfriend's trust and jealousy places them in the wrong.\n"
