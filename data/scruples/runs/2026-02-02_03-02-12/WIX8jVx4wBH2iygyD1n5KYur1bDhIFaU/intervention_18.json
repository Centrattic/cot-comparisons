One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend getting upset because her boyfriend had a friend, who is in a long-term relationship, sleep over with him. The friend fell asleep in his bed, and the boyfriend didn't mention it to his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and brought up past instances where the friend had been overly familiar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was in a relationship, so maybe there's an unspoken rule about not having friends of the opposite sex sleep over, especially when your partner is out. The boyfriend didn't initiate the sleepover, but he didn't inform his girlfriend either. The girlfriend was upset not just about the sleepover but also about past behaviors that he didn't realize were bothering her. Additionally, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned the friend, which the girlfriend interpreted as a green light for the friend to be close to him.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. Even if the boyfriend didn't do anything intentionally, not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend felt that his past jokes about threesomes made the situation more hurtful. The boyfriend, however, claims he didn't notice her discomfort before and now fears for his friendship with Annie.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't act with malice, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings in the situation. The fact that he mentioned the friend in a hypothetical threesome might have made the girlfriend feel that her boundaries were less respected. On the other hand, the friend was in a relationship, and the boyfriend didn't engage in any inappropriate behavior. The main issue is the lack of communication and not being aware of the girlfriend's perspective. So, while he's not entirely at fault, he could have been more considerate. The answer might lean towards B (No), but the answer would depend on the nuances of the relationship and expectations.\n"
