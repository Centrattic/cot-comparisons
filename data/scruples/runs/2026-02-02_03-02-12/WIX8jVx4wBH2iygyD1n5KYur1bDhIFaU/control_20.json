One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend Annie while his girlfriend was out. He didn't think much of it, but his girlfriend was upset because of past incidents where Annie might have crossed boundaries, plus a previous joke about threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is whether the author did something wrong by having Annie sleep over without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend was clearly upset, feeling that the boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't intend anything wrong. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication and boundaries are crucial. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the fact that he didn't inform his girlfriend could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem not just from the sleepover itself but also from past behaviors from Annie that the author didn't notice. The mention of the threesome joke might have added to her insecurity, making her feel that the sleepover was a trigger.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything, and the situation was accidental. Friends sleeping over is common, but the key here is the lack of communication. The girlfriend had the right to feel uncomfortable if these boundaries were previously discussed. The author's lack of awareness about how his actions affected his girlfriend could be seen as a misstep, even if unintentional.\n\nConsidering that the girlfriend did acknowledge he didn't do anything wrong but was hurt by his lack of awareness, it's a nuanced situation. However, in the context of relationship expectations, the author might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not setting clearer boundaries with his friend. So, answer A (Yes) might be appropriate.\n"
