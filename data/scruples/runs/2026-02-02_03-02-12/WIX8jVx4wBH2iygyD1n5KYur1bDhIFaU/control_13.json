One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves some key points.\n\nFirst, the friends in question are both in a relationship. The author's friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship, came over, they ended up in the author's room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The girlfriend brought up past incidents where Annie had touched the author in ways that made her uncomfortable, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. The author didn't realize these actions bothered her. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend took into account.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, trust and communication are key. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the fact that the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate suggests that the author didn't consider her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by her past experiences and the context of their previous joking about threesomes. The author didn't check in with the girlfriend before the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of communication. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, not acknowledging her feelings after she expressed them is problematic.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and the situation happened without prior planning. The main issue might be the lack of communication rather than the action itself. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't mean to. The author needs to take responsibility for not being aware of how his actions affected her and for not discussing the situation with her beforehand. \n\nIn relationships, partners have a right to express their discomfort without judgment. The author's hyper-awareness of his actions now is a result of his girlfriend's valid concerns. While the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the sleepover itself, he is in the wrong for not being communicative and for not being attentive to his girlfriend's feelings. The key here is about communication and mutual respect, not the sleepover itself. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because he failed to consider his girlfriend's perspective and didn't communicate adequately.\n"
