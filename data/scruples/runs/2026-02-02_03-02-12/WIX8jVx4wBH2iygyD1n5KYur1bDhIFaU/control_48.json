One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, not informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and mentioned this friend. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author and his friend fell asleep together in his room after a party. The girlfriend was at a concert with friends. The next day, he told her, and she was upset. She also brought up past instances where the friend was affectionate, which he didn't notice. The author didn't initiate anything but didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's main issue is that he mentioned the friend in the context of a threesome joke, which might have made her feel insecure.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? In relationships, communication and consideration are key. Even if the author didn't do anything intentional, not being aware of how his actions might affect his girlfriend is a problem. The girlfriend's reaction might be about trust and past jokes. The fact that he didn't think to ask his girlfriend before the sleepover shows a lack of communication. Also, the friend sleeping in his bed, even if innocent, could be sensitive. The author's perspective is that he felt it was nothing, but in a relationship, partners' feelings matter. So, the answer might be A (Yes), because he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective and the context of their previous conversation about threesomes added to her insecurity. However, the author didn't have malicious intent. But the main issue is not being aware and not communicating, which can be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
