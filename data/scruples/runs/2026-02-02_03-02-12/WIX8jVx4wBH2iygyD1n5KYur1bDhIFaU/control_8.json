One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover between the author (21M) and his friend Annie (22F). The author didn't ask his girlfriend (20F) about it. The girlfriend got upset because she felt the situation was inappropriate, especially since they had previously joked about having threesomes and the author had mentioned Annie in that context. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the sleepover happened without the girlfriend's knowledge, the girlfriend felt it was a boundary issue, and the author didn't realize how his actions affected her. The girlfriend points out that the author didn't notice her being uncomfortable before, like Annie playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was alone. \n\nNow, considering relationship norms, communication is crucial. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not consulting the girlfriend and not being aware of her feelings could be seen as a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because boundaries are important in relationships. The fact that they had talked about threesomes might have added to her concern, thinking it's something they should discuss together if they consider such scenarios serious.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and claims he didn't mean anything by Annie's actions. But the problem is more about the lack of communication and not being attuned to the girlfriend's feelings. The author is now hyper-aware and worried about the friendship, which shows he cares about both his girlfriend and Annie, but maybe he didn't handle the situation well.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. He didn't do anything intentionally harmful, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's perspective and the boundaries she had. Since relationships require mutual respect and communication, the author might have made a mistake in not being more communicative and considerate. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes) because he contributed to the problem by not acknowledging her feelings and the boundaries they should have discussed.\n"
