One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with their male friend and not informing their girlfriend. The situation is that Annie, a close friend, came over to drink, then they ended up in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and was upset because she felt it was inappropriate, especially after a past conversation where the author mentioned Annie in the context of hypothetical threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and communication are important. Even if the author didn't have any romantic intentions, not telling his girlfriend about a friend sleeping over in his bed might come off as a breach of trust. The girlfriend might feel that the author didn't consider her feelings or the potential for jealousy, especially since there was a prior joke about threesomes involving Annie. That joke could have planted a seed in her mind, making the situation more sensitive.\n\nThen, the author's actions: he didn't initiate the sleepover, but they ended up in his room, smoking, and falling asleep. It's possible that the girlfriend felt overshadowed or like the author's commitment wasn't clear. The key here is communication. The author thought it wasn't a big deal, but the girlfriend did. The fact that he didn't even mention it the next day might have made her feel ignored or not involved in his decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't act with malice. He didn't plan for Annie to sleep over, and he mentioned it when he saw her the next day. The girlfriend acknowledged that he didn't do anything wrong but still felt it was a problem because he didn't notice her discomfort. The prior conversation about threesomes complicates things because it might have made the girlfriend worry about the author's intentions with Annie.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, transparency is crucial. Even if the actions were innocent, the lack of communication could be a mistake. The author didn't consider how this might affect his girlfriend's feelings, especially given their past discussions. However, if the author truly didn't have any intention of making her upset and the actions were just a result of a night out with friends, then maybe the girlfriend overreacted. But the author should have been more aware and communicative. The answer might be a mix, but according to the options, the answer is either A or B. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation does involve a lack of communication, which is a common issue in relationships, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but perhaps he could have handled it better. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it perfectly. The main issue is the girlfriend's reaction being disproportionate. So the answer is B.\n"
