One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author had a sleepover with their female friend, Annie, in their room, and didn't tell their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because she felt the friend was overstepping boundaries, like holding hands or playing with his hair when the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there was a past joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't intentionally do anything to hurt their girlfriend. They didn't initiate the sleepover, and they thought nothing of it until the girlfriend brought it up. However, the girlfriend had valid concerns about boundaries and past comments. Even if the author didn't mean anything by the actions, the girlfriend's feelings are important. The key here is communication and mutual respect in a relationship. The author didn't communicate with their girlfriend beforehand, which can be a problem. Also, the mention of Annie in the past joke about threesomes might have contributed to the girlfriend's discomfort. So, even if the author didn't do anything malicious, they might have been unaware of how their actions affected their partner. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's feelings and not being more communicative. The answer is probably B, but I need to check if there's any aspect I'm missing. The author didn't act intentionally, but the failure to communicate could be a mistake.\n"
