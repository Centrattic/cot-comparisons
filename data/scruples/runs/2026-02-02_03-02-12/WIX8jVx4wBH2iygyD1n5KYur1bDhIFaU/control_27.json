One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (21M) had a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) in his room after they both decided not to go to a party. His girlfriend (20F) found out and got upset. He didn't tell her beforehand, and later he mentions that they had discussed threesomes jokingly, where he mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. Now, in relationships, boundaries are important. Even if the author didn't have any intentions, the act of having a female friend sleep in his bed without informing his girlfriend could be seen as crossing a line. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling betrayed, not just about the sleepover itself. \n\nThen there's the other stuff the girlfriend brought up, like Annie playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival. The author didn't think much of it, but if these actions were repeated, the girlfriend might have felt insecure or neglected. The key here is communication. The author didn't notice her discomfort, which suggests he wasn't paying attention to her feelings, which is a problem in a relationship.\n\nThe part about the threesomes conversation is interesting. Even if it was just a joke, bringing up someone else in that context could make the girlfriend feel like the author is considering cheating or is not committed. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about past comments than the sleepover itself.\n\nThe author now feels the girlfriend overreacted, but he's also worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether the author did something wrong. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author didn't ask his girlfriend before the sleepover, and even if it was innocent, not discussing it with her shows a lack of consideration. The girlfriend's feelings of being overlooked are valid because she felt the need to confront him later.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't do anything with malicious intent, the act of not involving his girlfriend and the prior joking about threesomes could have contributed to her feeling insecure. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings and not maintaining open communication.\n"
