One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend being upset about her boyfriend having a friend sleep over in his bed. The key points here are the dynamics of the relationship and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the author and his friend Annie fell asleep in his bed after a night of drinking and smoking. The author didn't realize this might be an issue until his girlfriend brought it up. The girlfriend was upset not just because of the sleepover, but also because she felt Annie had overstepped in other ways, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was nearby. Additionally, there's the mention of a past conversation where they joked about potential threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie. \n\nFrom the author's side, he didn't initiate any of the interactions with Annie and didn't see the problem initially. However, the girlfriend felt these actions were inappropriate, especially given their previous joke about threesomes. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling insecure or not being respected. \n\nThe author is now conflicted because he feels the girlfriend is overreacting, but he's also worried about his friendship with Annie. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's important to consider both perspectives. The author's actions might not be malicious, but he didn't consider how his girlfriend might feel. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the fact that Annie had a history of boundary-crossing (as per the girlfriend's view) and the previous conversation about threesomes could contribute to the girlfriend's insecurity. The author might not have done anything intentionally wrong, but he could have been more attentive to his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. \n\nSo, while the author might not be in the wrong in a legal or moral sense, he could be at fault in terms of communication and emotional consideration. However, the girlfriend's reaction might also be influenced by her own insecurities, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nBut according to the AITA context, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't act with malice and the girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings than his actions, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B). However, there's a nuance here where communication breakdown exists. The author could have been more aware of his girlfriend's feelings, but since he didn't realize the issue until she brought it up, it's a gray area. In many AITA scenarios, the person is considered not in the wrong if their actions were unintentional and they were unaware of the other person's feelings. So likely B.\n"
