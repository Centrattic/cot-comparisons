One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, and didn't tell his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. The author is now feeling like the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and Annie were in his room, they fell asleep together after drinking and smoking. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time. The author didn't see it as a big deal initially but the girlfriend was upset because of past comments where they joked about threesomes with Annie. The girlfriend felt that the author's previous comments made the sleepover more significant.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, communication and boundaries are key. Even if the author didn't intend to do anything wrong, not informing his girlfriend about a sleepover with another person could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by the previous conversation about threesomes, which could make her feel insecure or like the author is not respecting their relationship boundaries. \n\nThe author might not have meant any harm, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly might have made the situation more sensitive for her. So, even if the author didn't act intentionally, not considering how his actions affected her could be a mistake. \n\nHowever, if the author didn't have any malicious intent and the situation was an accident (they fell asleep), then maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. But in relationships, how the partner feels is important. The author might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled the communication better. \n\nThe answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Given that the author didn't initiate anything and it was an accident, but maybe should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more, maybe B is the answer. But the girlfriend's perspective is also important. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend said he didn't do anything wrong but was upset because of the previous joke, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. So the answer might be B.\n"
