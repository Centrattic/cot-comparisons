One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy having a sleepover with his female friend, which his girlfriend found out about and got upset. He's wondering if he's the AITA (Asshole of the Day) here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author (a guy, 21) had his friend Annie (22) over for drinks before a party. They ended up in his room watching TV, smoking, and fell asleep together in his bed. His girlfriend (20) was at a concert with a friend and came back later. The next day, he told her about Annie sleeping in the bed. The girlfriend was upset, mentioning previous instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival when she was alone. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nThe girlfriend didn't say he did anything wrong but felt he didn't notice her discomfort. Now, the author feels his girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from the girlfriend's perspective, even if the author didn't intentionally do anything, the act of having a friend sleep in his bed after drinking and smoking could be seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend's main points are that he didn't consider her feelings, didn't set boundaries with Annie, and the prior joke about threesomes made the situation more sensitive. \n\nThe author might argue he didn't mean anything by it, but in relationships, communication and awareness of one's partner's feelings are key. Even if the actions were innocent, the girlfriend's discomfort is valid. The fact that they had joked about threesomes involving Annie could have led the girlfriend to feel that the situation was more charged, even if it was just a joke. \n\nAlso, the author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of consideration. Even if he thought it was casual, not discussing it beforehand might be why she felt upset. The author's not noticing the previous boundary issues shows a lack of awareness of how his actions might affect his girlfriend, even if he had no ill intent.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as over-the-top, especially if the author had no malicious intent. However, in a relationship, both partners need to be mindful of each other's feelings and boundaries. The author's failure to recognize her discomfort and the prior conversation about threesomes likely exacerbated the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover, didn't set boundaries with Annie, and wasn't attentive to his girlfriend's feelings. Even if his actions were innocent, the lack of communication and awareness of her perspective is a misstep. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
