One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend in his bed, and his girlfriend got upset about it. The guy is unsure if he did something wrong, especially considering past conversations about hypothetical threesomes.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his friend Annie were going to a party but ended up staying in his room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate towards the author, which he didn't see as problematic. Also, there was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, and even though the author didn't initiate anything inappropriate, she felt it was inconsiderate not to inform her. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes with Annie could make her feel insecure or neglected. The author might not have realized how his actions affected her, but that doesn't mean he intended harm.\n\nFrom the author's side, he didn't do anything intentionally wrong. He thought the sleepover was harmless, and he didn't notice the signs that Annie was overstepping. However, in relationships, communication is key. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, not being aware of her feelings and not checking in with her could be seen as a misstep.\n\nSo, the question is whether being unaware of her feelings and not informing her about the sleepover makes him at fault. Some might say yes because he should have been more considerate. Others might say no because there was no malicious intent. The part about the past conversation about threesomes complicates things. If they had discussed it in a hypothetical way, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is partly due to past insecurities. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong for the actions themselves but could have been more communicative. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt, but the author might be overthinking the friendship with Annie if he's now hyper-aware. So, it's a mix of both perspectives. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether not informing the girlfriend is a mistake. Since he didn't ask her about the sleepover, even though it was a friend, in a relationship, it's better to communicate such things. Therefore, maybe the author is partially in the wrong. But given that there was no intention to hurt her, it's a gray area. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, so the author might be at fault for not being more communicative.\n"
