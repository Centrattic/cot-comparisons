One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend who's in a long-term relationship, and didn't ask their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the friend might have crossed boundaries before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Annie watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The author didn't initiate any of it, and they had a friend bail on a party. The girlfriend wasn't there that night. The next morning, the author told the girlfriend, but didn't think much of it. Then the girlfriend brought up past incidents where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with hair and holding hands, which the author didn't notice. Also, the author had mentioned Annie in a joke about threesomes.\n\nSo, key points here: Did the author do something wrong? Well, they had a friend of the opposite sex sleep in their bed, which could be seen as a boundary issue in a relationship. However, the friend is in a long-term relationship, so maybe the girlfriend is being overly sensitive? But the author didn't initiate the sleepover, it just happened. The girlfriend is upset because of past comments and behaviors that the author didn't realize were problematic. The author's girlfriend feels that the trust is being compromised, even if the author didn't mean anything by it.\n\nThe author is now feeling that the girlfriend is overreacting, but the girlfriend's reaction is based on the combination of the sleepover and previous joking about threesomes. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have contributed to the girlfriend's insecurity. The question is whether the author had a responsibility to consider their girlfriend's feelings and avoid situations that could be perceived as inappropriate, even if the author didn't see it that way.\n\nIn relationships, communication and being mindful of each other's boundaries are important. Even if the author didn't intend to harm the girlfriend, not considering how the girlfriend might feel about the sleepover and the past jokes could be seen as negligence. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of actual actions (since nothing inappropriate happened), but they might have failed to communicate or be considerate of the girlfriend's feelings, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. The answer could be B (No) because the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong. But some might argue they should have been more aware of the girlfriend's perspective. However, given that the friend is in a relationship and the author had no ill intent, the answer leans towards B.\n"
