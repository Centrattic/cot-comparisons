One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a friend, Annie, sleep over in his bed, and his girlfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that Annie is in a long-term relationship herself. They had drinks, smoked some joints, and fell asleep watching TV in his room. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time and found out later. She got upset because she thought it was inappropriate, especially considering a previous conversation where they jokingly discussed having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. The girlfriend feels that the situation with Annie sleeping over and Annie's other boundary-crossing behaviors (like playing with his hair, holding hands) are issues she's sensitive about.\n\nThe author feels his girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, what's the key here? The girlfriend's perspective is important. In a relationship, trust and communication are crucial. The author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, but the fact that he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings is a problem. Even if the behavior with Annie was innocent, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author's mention of a past joke about threesomes involving Annie might have made the current situation more triggering for her. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a lapse in communication. He might not have realized the significance of the actions, especially given the context of their previous conversation. While the actions themselves (sleeping in the same room, smoking, watching TV) aren't inherently wrong, the girlfriend's perception matters in the relationship. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't do anything with bad intent, he could be at fault for not being more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and for not discussing the situation with her beforehand. The key point is that in a relationship, both partners' feelings need to be acknowledged and respected. The author's hyperawareness of his actions after the fact suggests he understands that his girlfriend's feelings were important, but the initial oversight might be where he went wrong.\n"
