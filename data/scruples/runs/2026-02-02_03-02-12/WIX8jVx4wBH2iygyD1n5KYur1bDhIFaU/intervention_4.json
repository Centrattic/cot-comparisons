One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his dorm room where they fell asleep together. His girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because there was a prior conversation about wanting to have a threesome and naming Annie. Now the author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The couple has been together for two years, and communication is key in any relationship. The author didn't invite Annie over for the sleepover with the intention of being inappropriate, but the fact that they both ended up asleep in the same bed could be a problem. Even if it was accidental, the girlfriend might feel that the setup was too intimate. \n\nThen there's the part where they discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Even if it was just a hypothetical conversation, bringing up a specific friend might have planted seeds of doubt or insecurity in the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction could be a mix of feeling neglected or insecure about the author's interest in Annie. \n\nThe author claims he didn't do anything wrong, but the issue here is about perception and how his actions, even if well-intentioned, made his girlfriend feel. The girlfriend did acknowledge he didn't initiate the sleepover but that he didn't notice her being bothered by Annie's behavior before. This suggests that the author might not have been fully attentive to his girlfriend's feelings in their interactions with Annie. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's tricky because intentions matter, but so does the impact. The author didn't do anything explicitly cheating, but the situation could be seen as crossing a boundary in a relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should consider her perspective more. However, the author's reaction to feeling the situation was blown out of proportion is also a valid viewpoint if he truly didn't intend to hurt her. \n\nThe key points are: the sleepover happened without informing the girlfriend, the prior conversation about threesomes involving Annie, and the girlfriend pointing out other instances where Annie might have overstepped. The author's failure to notice these things might indicate a lack of awareness of his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a 50-50. On one hand, he didn't mean to hurt her and didn't initiate the sleepover. On the other hand, he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings and possibly avoided situations that could cause her distress, especially after the threesome discussion. The answer depends on whether the situation is seen as a misunderstanding or a boundary that was crossed. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, but he could have been more mindful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
