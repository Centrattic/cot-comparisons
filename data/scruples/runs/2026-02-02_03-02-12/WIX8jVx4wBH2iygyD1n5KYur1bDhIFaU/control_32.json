One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author's friend Annie came over for drinks, then stayed to watch TV and ended up falling asleep in his room. The author didn't think to tell his girlfriend until the next day. The girlfriend was upset because she found it inappropriate and mentioned past instances where Annie seemed to overstep, like playing with his hair and holding his hand when she was nearby. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author admitted he didn't think about how his actions might affect his girlfriend, even though he didn't intentionally cross any lines. The girlfriend's reaction is partly influenced by a past conversation where the author joked about having a threesome with Annie, which adds to her insecurity.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, transparency is important. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating the situation could be seen as a mistake. The fact that the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and that there's a history of her feeling that Annie oversteps suggests that the author should have been more mindful of her boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author didn't do anything malicious. He had a friend over, and it was an accident. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be more about past insecurities and a specific conversation that's now causing tension. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend pointed out that he hadn't noticed her discomfort and that there was a history of Annie's behavior, the author's lack of awareness might be part of the problem. He should have been more proactive in considering her feelings and setting boundaries to avoid misunderstandings. \n\nSo, while the author may not have intended harm, his failure to communicate and consider his girlfriend's perspective could place him in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
