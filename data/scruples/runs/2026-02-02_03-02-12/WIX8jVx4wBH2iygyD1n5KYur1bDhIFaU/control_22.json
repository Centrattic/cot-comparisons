One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a guy who had a sleepover with a female friend, not informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend later got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's friend, Annie, came over, they watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was close with the author, which she felt were boundary issues. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie, which might have contributed to her feelings.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective: she's in a relationship and trusts her partner. If there's a history of discussing boundaries and even joking about threesomes, maybe she felt vulnerable. The fact that the author didn't think to inform her about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of consideration. Even if he didn't do anything wrong, not checking in with her might have made her feel insecure.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything. He and Annie just fell asleep. The girlfriend's reaction might be overblown, especially if the author didn't have any intent to cross boundaries. The fact that he thought nothing of it initially suggests he didn't see the issue. But trust is important in relationships, and maybe he should have considered her feelings more.\n\nThe girlfriend's anger could be influenced by the previous conversation about threesomes. Even if it was a joke, mentioning Annie there might have made the recent sleepover more hurtful. The author might be in the wrong for not being aware of how that joke could affect her. Also, not informing her about the sleepover could be a breach of trust, even if unintended.\n\nBut the author's friend might argue that he didn't do anything intentionally. The main issue here is communication. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend, which led to her feeling upset. In a healthy relationship, partners should communicate openly about their comfort levels. The author's failure to do so, especially after previous discussions about boundaries, might make him at fault.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction might also be disproportionate. The act of sleeping in the same room doesn't necessarily imply anything inappropriate. The context\u2014drinking, smoking, not going to the party\u2014could be factors. But the key is how the girlfriend perceived it. If she felt insecure, even if the author didn't mean to, he should have been more mindful.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating openly. He should have discussed the sleepover with her beforehand and taken into account her previous concerns about Annie's behavior. Even if he didn't act with malice, the lack of communication could be seen as a mistake.\n"
