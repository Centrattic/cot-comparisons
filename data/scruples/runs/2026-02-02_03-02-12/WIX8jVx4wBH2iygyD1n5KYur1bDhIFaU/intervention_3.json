One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend in their room, leading to the girlfriend being upset. The key points are: the author didn't invite the friend over for the sleepover but they ended up there after a party plans fell through. The girlfriend was upset about previous interactions where the friend was physically affectionate towards the author, and there was a conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned the friend. The author now feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend expressed her feelings when she found out, pointing out that the author didn't notice her discomfort in past interactions with Annie. The author didn't initiate the sleepover but didn't set boundaries to prevent it either. Even though the author claims they didn't do anything wrong, not realizing their friend's behavior made the girlfriend uncomfortable shows a lack of awareness. \n\nThe girlfriend's main issue might be about the author not being attentive to her feelings in the past, which led to her feeling hurt now. The fact that they had a conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie could also be a trigger, making her feel like the author was fantasizing about someone else. \n\nEven if the author didn't explicitly do anything wrong, not considering the girlfriend's perspective and not setting boundaries with Annie could be seen as a mistake. The author's friend was in a long-term relationship herself, so maybe she had her own boundaries, but the author's lack of action in preventing the situation might be the issue here.\n\nSo, while the author didn't act intentionally, their lack of awareness and not addressing the girlfriend's concerns proactively might make them at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong). However, if the author had no intention of overstepping and it was a genuine oversight, maybe they're not. It's a bit of a grey area. But the girlfriend's valid concerns about the author not noticing her discomfort before might tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong for not being more considerate.\n"
