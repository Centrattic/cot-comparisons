One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he had a sleepover with his friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend got upset because of this and also brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. The author mentioned he had joked about threesomes involving Annie, which the girlfriend found relevant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and relationship boundaries. In many relationships, partners expect exclusivity in physical and emotional intimacy. Sharing a bed with a friend, especially when the girlfriend could perceive it as a breach of that exclusivity, might be a red flag. Even if there was no intention to be inappropriate, the act itself could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nThen there's the aspect of communication. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which might have been a mistake. The girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and also mentioned past behaviors that he hadn't noticed. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly, and the author had mentioned Annie, could have influenced her reaction. She might have felt that the sleepover with Annie triggered her insecurities, even if it wasn't intentional.\n\nAnother angle is the friend Annie being in a long-term relationship herself. If Annie had done the same with her partner, the girlfriend might have a point about boundaries. The author's lack of awareness about Annie's behavior (like hand-holding) shows he might not have considered how it affects his girlfriend.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't have any intention of being inappropriate. He thought nothing of it afterward, which suggests he might not see it as a big issue. But in relationships, the perception and feelings of the partner matter a lot. The girlfriend's reaction isn't just about the sleepover but also about cumulative incidents that made her feel insecure.\n\nSo, while the author might not have done anything with malice, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries could be seen as a mistake. The key here is whether he should have been more mindful of how his actions, even if innocent, might affect his partner. The answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings and continued to interact in ways that made her uncomfortable. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the actions were innocent and the girlfriend overreacted. But given the context of previous jokes about threesomes and the girlfriend's sensitivity, it's more about communication and awareness.\n"
