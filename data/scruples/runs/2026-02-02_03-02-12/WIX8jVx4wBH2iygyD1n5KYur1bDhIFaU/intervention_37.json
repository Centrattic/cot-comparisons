One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing their girlfriend. The situation involves the author, their girlfriend, and their friend Annie. \n\nFirst, the author and Annie had a sleepover after a party canceled. They watched TV in the author's room, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was a prior conversation where the author mentioned Annie in the context of hypothetical threesomes.\n\nThe author argues they didn't do anything wrong since they didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't have intentions beyond friendship. The girlfriend felt uncomfortable because of the previous conversation about threesomes and Annie's other behaviors like holding hands. The author now feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about their friendship with Annie.\n\nHmm, from a relationship standpoint, the key issue is communication. The author didn't inform their girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not consulting their partner about who they're spending the night with in their room might be a problem. \n\nAlso, the prior conversation about threesomes adds context. If the author had mentioned Annie in that hypothetical, it could have been misinterpreted, especially if the girlfriend felt it validated her insecurities. The girlfriend's reaction might be a mix of jealousy and past discussions that she interpreted seriously.\n\nBut the author didn't have any sexual intentions. They fell asleep with a friend, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the lack of communication and the context of the previous conversation might have contributed to the girlfriend's hurt feelings. So, while the author might not be at fault for the sleepover itself, the situation could have been handled better with open communication.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but there's room for improvement in communication. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but the author's actions weren't malicious. The main issue is the communication gap rather than the sleepover itself.\n"
