One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with a female friend when his girlfriend wasn't around. They had some drinks, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset because of past incidents where the friend might have crossed boundaries. Also, the author had jokingly mentioned the friend in a hypothetical threesome scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Trust and communication are key in relationships. Even if the author didn't mean anything by the sleepover, not informing his girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend might feel that having a friend over in the bed, especially when they had planned to go out but didn't, was an oversight he should have communicated about. \n\nThen there's the aspect of past behavior. The girlfriend mentioned that the friend had been overstepping before, like playing with the author's hair and holding hands. If these were consistent issues, the author might not have realized their impact, but the girlfriend's reaction could be a culmination of those incidents. The author's comment about the threesome, even if it was a joke, might have triggered her concerns because it implied some level of interest in the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the sleepover and thought it was a normal friendship. The friend in question is in a long-term relationship, so maybe there's no romantic intent. However, the fact that the author didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings in the moment could be a problem. The core issue here seems to be about communication and the girlfriend's emotional needs not being met.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. From a relationship standpoint, not considering a partner's feelings and not seeking to avoid situations that might cause discomfort can be seen as a misstep. Even if the actions were innocent, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author might need to work on being more attuned to her perspective. However, the author's intention wasn't malicious, so maybe he's not entirely to blame. \n\nIn terms of the friend's reaction, the girlfriend's valid feelings here might have been overlooked by the author. The author's joke about the threesome might have been a red flag the girlfriend picked up on, making the current situation more sensitive. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author should have been more communicative and aware of his girlfriend's sensitivities. Since the girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings and past experiences, and the author didn't realize the impact, it's a matter of perspective. However, in relationships, it's important to consider the partner's feelings even if the actions seem minor. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for him to improve in communication and sensitivity.\n"
