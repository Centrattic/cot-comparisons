One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who had a friend over, they ended up sleeping in his bed, and his girlfriend got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in a two-year relationship, and his girlfriend is 20. The friend is 22, and they were both at a party. The friend came over before a party, friends bailed, so they ended up watching TV, smoking, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't know. The next day, he told her, and then later, when she confronted him, she was upset about the sleepover and some previous interactions where the friend might have overstepped, like holding his hand. Also, there was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes and he mentioned the friend.\n\nThe author feels his girlfriend is overreacting, and he's worried about his friendship with the friend. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the details: The author didn't initiate anything with the friend. They were hanging out, got drunk, fell asleep. The girlfriend was out, so he didn't involve her. The friend was in a relationship, and the author's girlfriend is in a relationship. The author didn't have any romantic intent, but the girlfriend is upset because of past comments and the fact that the friend crossed boundaries in her eyes.\n\nIn relationships, communication and boundaries are key. The author didn't set a boundary when the friend was being affectionate, and the past joke about threesomes might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. Even if the author didn't mean anything by the sleepover, the girlfriend felt hurt and the actions, especially the past comments, contributed to her perspective.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt, the fact that he was aware (from previous conversations) that the girlfriend was sensitive about this and didn't consider her feelings in the sleepover situation could make him partially at fault. The friend's actions (holding hands, etc.) and the joke about threesomes might have been red flags he overlooked. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions, even if unintentional, hurt his girlfriend and he didn't respect her boundaries.\n"
