One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The key points here are that the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, but there's history of them joking about threesomes and the author mentioning Annie. The girlfriend felt the sleepover was inappropriate because of past behaviors she noticed, like Annie being overly affectionate.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. In relationships, communication is key. The author didn't think to inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not talking to his girlfriend about it might have caused unnecessary worry. Also, considering the past comments about threesomes and choosing Annie, the girlfriend might have felt insecure, and the author should have been more aware of her feelings.\n\nHowever, the author didn't have any malicious intent. He was with a close friend, and the situation led to them falling asleep together. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be partly due to her own insecurities and past conversations. The author might not be in the wrong for the actions themselves but could have handled the communication better. It's a gray area, but since the girlfriend felt hurt and the lack of communication led to her distress, maybe the author is partially at fault. But since the actions were innocent, maybe not entirely. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's reaction is based on her own insecurities and not actual wrongdoing by the author, then he's not in the wrong. But if the act of not informing her is considered a breach of trust, then maybe he is. The key here is that the author didn't have any intention of being unfaithful or disrespectful. The main issue is the lack of communication. In relationships, even if something is innocent, not discussing it can be problematic. So, the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't communicate, but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, B (No) because the actions themselves were innocent. Hmm.\n"
