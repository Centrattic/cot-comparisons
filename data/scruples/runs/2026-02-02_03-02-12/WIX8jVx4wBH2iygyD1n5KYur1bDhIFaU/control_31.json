One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe guy had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, who's 22 and in a long-term relationship. They were at his place, watched TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep in his bed. His girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and came back to her own place. He told her the next day, but didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend was upset because she felt it was inappropriate. She also mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate with the author when she was nearby but not interacting. Plus, there was a joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. Now, he's feeling his girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the sleepover. Both are adults. The author's friend is in a relationship, so maybe there's some tension there. But the author didn't invite her; she came over, they ended up there. He told his girlfriend, so communication was done. But the girlfriend feels it's inappropriate. Why? Maybe because she's uncomfortable with Annie being in his bed, especially given the past comments about threesomes. \n\nThe past instances where Annie plays with his hair and holds his hand when the girlfriend is nearby might be making the girlfriend feel neglected or that the author is too comfortable with Annie. The threesome joke adds another layer. Even if it was a joke, mentioning Annie in that context could have made the girlfriend feel insecure.\n\nSo, the author might not have intended anything wrong, but he didn't consider how his actions and jokes affected his girlfriend. Even if he didn't initiate the sleepover, the fact that he didn't notice the boundaries his girlfriend wanted might be his fault. He should have been more aware of her feelings, especially since they had discussed these topics before. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend did acknowledge he didn't do anything wrong, but the issue is that he didn't realize how it made her feel. That's a communication problem. The author might need to be more mindful of his girlfriend's perspective, even if he thinks the actions were innocent. The key here is about emotional sensitivity and respecting her feelings, not just the actual actions. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's not being intentionally hurtful, maybe not. But in relationships, it's about how your actions make your partner feel. If he failed to consider her feelings despite her previous concerns, then perhaps he's partially at fault. The answer would be A (Yes) if we consider that he should have been more attentive to her boundaries, and B (No) if we think the actions themselves weren't wrong. But given the context, the fact that he had previous discussions about threesomes and Annie's behavior, he should have been more cautious. So leaning towards A.\n"
