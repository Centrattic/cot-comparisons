One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and communication.\n\nFirst, the author and his friend Annie were at his place, ended up in his bed after some drinks and a couple of joints. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The author didn't think it was a big deal initially, but the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially considering past conversations about threesomes which included Annie.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author crossed any boundaries. In many relationships, partners expect each other to be mindful of interactions with others, especially when it comes to spending the night or being in bed together. Even if there's no intention of infidelity, the act of sharing a bed with a friend can be seen as a breach of trust or an invasion of privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were overlooked. The author didn't consider how his actions might affect her, even if he didn't have bad intentions. Also, the past conversations about threesomes might have triggered her insecurities, making the situation more sensitive. \n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate anything inappropriate, and he didn't have any intention of being unfaithful. He just had a friend over and fell asleep. The problem here is more about communication and sensitivity to the girlfriend's feelings rather than malicious intent.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a strict sense, but he could be at fault for not being considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and not setting clearer boundaries with his friend. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding, and sometimes what one person sees as innocent, the other might see as a red flag. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) but with a note that he could have done better by communicating with his girlfriend beforehand.\n"
