One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, which his girlfriend found upsetting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's friend, Annie, came over to his room, they ended up watching TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The author didn't think anything of it until the next day when the girlfriend confronted him.\n\nThe girlfriend's main issues seem to be about boundaries and past behaviors. She mentioned instances where Annie was overly affectionate, like playing with the author's hair and holding his hand. Also, the girlfriend feels hurt because the author had mentioned Annie in hypothetical threesome conversations, even though they weren't serious. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author did something wrong. From a relationship perspective, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and communicate openly. The author didn't intentionally exclude his girlfriend from the sleepover, but he might have been unaware of how his actions affected her. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable with Annie's behavior and the past comments. However, the author didn't initiate the sleepover in a way that was intentionally disrespectful. He also thought nothing of it at first, showing he didn't realize the impact. \n\nThe key points here are communication and awareness. The author might not have been in the wrong in terms of actions, but he could have been more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings. However, given the situation wasn't malicious, it's a matter of differing perspectives. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be B (No), as the author didn't act with malice but needs to be more attuned to his girlfriend's feelings.\n"
