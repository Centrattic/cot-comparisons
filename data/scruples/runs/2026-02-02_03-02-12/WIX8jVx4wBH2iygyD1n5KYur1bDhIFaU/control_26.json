One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, in his room. They both fell asleep there, and the author didn't think much of it. The girlfriend found out later and got upset, especially because there was a prior conversation where they joked about having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. The girlfriend feels that Annie has crossed boundaries before, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while she was alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't initiate any of the interactions with Annie but didn't notice the boundaries his girlfriend was concerned about. The main issue seems to be about communication and being aware of the girlfriend's feelings. The author didn't do anything intentionally wrong according to his own account, but he might have been unaware of how his actions made his girlfriend feel. \n\nThe girlfriend brought up past incidents that the author didn't realize were problematic. That suggests that the girlfriend felt these things were building up, and the sleepover was the last straw. The author's lack of awareness about her feelings could be seen as a failure to consider her perspective, even if he didn't act with malicious intent. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't engage in anything inappropriate with Annie. They just fell asleep together, and he didn't initiate the sleepover. The problem might be more about the girlfriend's insecurities and the prior discussion about threesomes. If they had talked about boundaries beforehand, maybe the author should have been more cautious, but the scenario doesn't indicate that they had such discussions. \n\nSo, is the author at fault for not realizing that the sleepover could be an issue? It's possible that he wasn't in the wrong because he didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend. However, he might have failed to consider her feelings and the context of their past conversations. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable, and the author should have been more attentive to her boundaries. \n\nIn AITA situations, the key is whether the action was intentionally harmful or if it was an oversight despite the other person's feelings. Here, it's more about the latter. The author didn't act with malice but might have been negligent in noticing his girlfriend's concerns. Therefore, he could be seen as partially at fault for not being more considerate of her feelings, even if the action itself wasn't inherently wrong.\n"
