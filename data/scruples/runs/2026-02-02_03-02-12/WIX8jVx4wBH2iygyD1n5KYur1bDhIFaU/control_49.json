One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, in his room where they ended up falling asleep together. The girlfriend found out and is upset, especially because they had previously discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Annie were at a party but ended up not going. They stayed in the author's room, smoked, watched TV, and fell asleep. The author didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend later confronted him about Annie's actions, which he didn't realize were bothering her. The main issue seems to be the lack of communication and the girlfriend's feelings about boundaries and past conversations about threesomes.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is crucial. Even if the author didn't have any intentions, not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by the previous discussion about threesomes, which added an extra layer of sensitivity. The author might not have realized how his actions, even if innocent, could affect his girlfriend's insecurities or jealousy.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author had to be told by the girlfriend about Annie's previous overstepping behaviors (like playing with hair and holding hands) suggests that he wasn't attentive to his girlfriend's feelings. Even if he didn't mean anything by it, not noticing that these actions bothered her shows a lack of awareness. \n\nIn terms of the author's current feelings of being hyper-aware and fearing the friendship's change, that's a valid emotional response, but it doesn't negate the need for open communication and respecting his girlfriend's boundaries. The key here is whether the author's actions were negligent in terms of considering his girlfriend's feelings, which they were. \n\nSo, while the author may not have had malicious intent, the failure to communicate and the lack of awareness of his girlfriend's discomfort points towards him being at least partially in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction isn't entirely overblown if there was prior context that made the situation more sensitive. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
