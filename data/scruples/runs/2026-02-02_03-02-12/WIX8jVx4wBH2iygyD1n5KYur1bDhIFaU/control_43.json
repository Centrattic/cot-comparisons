One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it, citing past behaviors where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. Also, there was a conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend points out as a trigger for her upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. From the story, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he also didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes in a joking manner might have contributed to the girlfriend's discomfort. Even if it was just a joke, bringing up Annie in that context could have planted seeds of doubt. Also, the girlfriend felt that the author didn't notice her being bothered by Annie's behavior before. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author didn't communicate the sleepover with his girlfriend, which is a big no-no in relationships. Even if it was just a friend falling asleep, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because trust and communication are crucial. The hyperawareness and fear of losing the friendship might be on the author's side, but that doesn't negate the girlfriend's right to feel upset. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not being considerate of his girlfriend's feelings, even if the actions seemed innocent. The girlfriend is within her right to express her discomfort, especially since the author's past comments about threesomes could have made her feel insecure. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
