One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not informing his girlfriend about a sleepover with a female friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author (21M) had a friend (22F) come over, they ended up in his room watching TV, smoking, and falling asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned that the author mentioned the friend as a potential person for a threesome, which might have contributed to her feelings.\n\nKey points to consider: Did the author do something intentionally wrong? He didn't initiate the sleepover, but he didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt the friend was overstepping boundaries in the past. The author didn't realize how this made his girlfriend feel. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the actions themselves (sleeping in the same room) weren't malicious, not discussing it with the girlfriend could be seen as a failure to consider her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by past jokes about threesomes, which could have made her more sensitive. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if he didn't have bad intentions, but he also didn't communicate. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she felt uncomfortable. So, while he might not be \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense, he could be wrong in terms of relationship dynamics. However, the question is whether he is at fault. Since the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide based on typical relationship advice. Often, not communicating about such situations can lead to issues, so maybe he's in the wrong. But if the actions weren't deliberate, maybe not. The community might side with B, but some might say A. Hmm.\n"
