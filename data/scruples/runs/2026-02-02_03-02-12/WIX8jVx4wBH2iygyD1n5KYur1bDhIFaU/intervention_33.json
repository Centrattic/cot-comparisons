One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a guy in a two-year relationship, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie. They ended up in his bed, fell asleep, and didn't do anything inappropriate. The girlfriend found out and was upset, mentioning past instances where Annie had crossed boundaries, like holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't think much of it at the time, but the girlfriend brought up a conversation where they had joked about threesomes, and he had mentioned Annie, which added to her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The author didn't mean to hurt his girlfriend, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. Even if Annie was just a friend, sleeping in the same bed could be seen as a boundary cross, especially if the girlfriend didn't know. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the plans, so maybe he should have communicated better. \n\nBut wait, the author says he didn't intend anything wrong. He had a friend over, they watched TV, smoked, fell asleep. It's possible that the girlfriend felt her boundaries were being tested, especially with the past behavior of Annie. The author didn't see it as a problem because he didn't initiate anything, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The fact that the author had mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes, even jokingly, might have triggered her insecurities. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong in not considering his girlfriend's feelings when he had Annie over, even if he didn't do anything intentional. The girlfriend's reaction, while perhaps emotional, is about feeling disrespected. On the other hand, the author might not have realized the impact of his actions. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't communicate his plans with his girlfriend, which could be a mistake. Even if it was a sleepover with a friend, not discussing it could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Also, the past comments about threesomes might have made the girlfriend feel that the author wasn't fully committed to the relationship. \n\nBut then again, if the author didn't have any intention of being inappropriate, maybe the girlfriend overreacted. However, the author's failure to notice her discomfort in previous instances (like Annie playing with his hair) suggests that he wasn't attentive enough to her feelings. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be at fault for not setting clearer boundaries and not communicating better with his girlfriend. Even if the actions themselves weren't wrong, the lack of consideration for her feelings and the failure to acknowledge her concerns could place some responsibility on the author. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong). However, if the girlfriend's reaction is disproportionate given the circumstances, then maybe B is correct. But in relationships, the perception and feelings matter. The author's not asking the girlfriend about the sleepover and the prior jokes about threesomes likely contributed to her hurt feelings. So leaning towards A.\n"
