One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for having a sleepover with a male friend and a female friend (Annie) without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, especially because of past conversations about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked weed, and fell asleep together. The author didn't think to ask his girlfriend. The girlfriend was at a concert with friends. The author didn't realize the issue until the next day when he told her. She got upset because Annie had previously acted in ways she found inappropriate, and the author had mentioned Annie in hypothetical threesome discussions.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key points here are communication and the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the author didn't have ill intentions, not considering his girlfriend's perspective and past concerns shows a lack of communication. The girlfriend felt that the sleepover crossed a line, especially given the context of past talks about threesomes and Annie's behavior. The author didn't notice these signs, which might indicate he wasn't attentive enough to her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and considering the partner's feelings are crucial. Even if there's no malicious intent, the author's actions might have unintentionally hurt his girlfriend's feelings. The fact that he didn't ask for her opinion on the sleepover and didn't realize the significance of Annie's actions before shows a gap in communication. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend had specific reasons (past behavior of Annie and the threesome conversation) that made the situation more sensitive for her. The author's hyper-awareness after the fact suggests he understands that his actions could be perceived as dismissive of her concerns. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to do anything wrong, the lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's feelings likely puts him in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
