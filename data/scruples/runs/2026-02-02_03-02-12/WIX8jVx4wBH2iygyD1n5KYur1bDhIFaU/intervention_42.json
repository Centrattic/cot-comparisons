One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author (21M) had a friend, Annie (22F), over for drinks before a party. They ended up staying in his room, watched TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend (20F) wasn't there at the time; she was at a concert with friends. The next day, he told her, and she was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. The girlfriend now feels hurt because of that past comment and the recent sleepover.\n\nSo, the main issues here are communication and boundaries in the relationship. The author didn't ask his girlfriend for permission, which might be a problem in a committed relationship. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the lack of communication could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling that the author didn't consider her feelings, especially with the history of discussing threesomes and Annie's behavior. \n\nThe author might argue that there was no intention to hurt her, but in relationships, intention isn't the only factor. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the fact that the author didn't check in with her could be seen as dismissive. Also, the sleepover happened in his room, which is a private space, and even if they fell asleep accidentally, it's a situation that could be misinterpreted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't plan the sleepover; it was a result of their friends bailing. He communicated it the next day, which is a positive step. However, the girlfriend's prior concerns about Annie's boundaries and the threesomes joke add context. The author might not have realized how these things stacked up, but it's his responsibility to be aware of his partner's comfort levels.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the relationship norms include discussing social interactions with the partner, then not informing her could be a breach. But if there's no prior agreement about such things, it's more about the girlfriend's feelings being hurt. The hyperawareness he feels now is a consequence of not addressing her concerns sooner. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the expectation of communication in the relationship. Since the girlfriend expressed that she felt the sleepover was inappropriate and linked it to past jokes, the author might be in the wrong for not being more mindful of her perspective and not discussing it before the sleepover happened.\n"
