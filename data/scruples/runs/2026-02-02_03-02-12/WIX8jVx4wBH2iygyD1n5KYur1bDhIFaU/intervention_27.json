One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset about it, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes with Annie. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Annie were hanging out, ended up falling asleep together. The key points here are whether there was any intention to overstep, and if the author was aware of the girlfriend's feelings beforehand. The author didn't initiate any romantic gestures with Annie and thought nothing of it afterward. However, the girlfriend felt uncomfortable because of past jokes about threesomes. \n\nNow, in relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction stems from feeling that the boundaries were not respected, even if the author didn't mean to cross them. The fact that they had discussed threesomes with Annie in a joking manner might have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Well, the action itself\u2014sleeping in the same room\u2014might not be inherently wrong, but the lack of communication with his girlfriend is a red flag. The girlfriend had the right to feel upset because the situation could be perceived as a breach of trust. The author didn't consider her feelings in that moment, which is a mistake. However, if the author hadn't intended anything wrong and there was no prior history of issues, it's not entirely his fault. \n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is valid too. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the action could be hurtful. The author's friends had joked about threesomes, which might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. The author's hyper-awareness now shows he realizes the potential impact. \n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit of a grey area. The author might not be at fault for the action itself, but the lack of communication and not considering his girlfriend's feelings is a mistake. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also understandable given the context of their previous conversations. \n\nIn the end, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) but with a caveat that communication could have been better. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering the girlfriend's valid feelings, maybe the answer is more nuanced. But traditionally, in such questions, if there's no malicious intent and the person didn't know it bothered their partner, they're often not in the wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
