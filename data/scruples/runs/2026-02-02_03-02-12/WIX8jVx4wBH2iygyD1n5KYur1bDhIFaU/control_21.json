One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, in his room. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because there was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes involving Annie. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted, but he's worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and boundaries are important. The fact that they had a conversation about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie might have triggered her feelings. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the girlfriend could feel that the sleepover crossed a line, especially since they were in his room and fell asleep together. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling uncomfortable with the boundaries between the author and his friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intentionally overstep. He didn't initiate anything, and he hadn't noticed her discomfort before. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding of boundaries. The girlfriend did say the author didn't do anything wrong, but the issue is that he wasn't aware of how his actions made her feel. So maybe the author isn't wrong in his actions, but he might be wrong for not being aware of how those actions affected his girlfriend. The problem is about communication and emotional awareness rather than intentional wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author and Annie are close friends, and the girlfriend feels that Annie crosses boundaries (like playing with hair, holding hands) adds to her stress. The author not noticing these things could indicate a lack of attention to his girlfriend's feelings, which is a relationship issue. However, the author didn't do anything malicious. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but he needs to work on communication.\n"
