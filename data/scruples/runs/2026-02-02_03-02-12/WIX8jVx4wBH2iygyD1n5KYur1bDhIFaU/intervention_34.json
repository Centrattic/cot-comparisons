One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author, a guy who's in a two-year relationship with his girlfriend, had a sleepover with his female friend Annie. They fell asleep in his room after drinking and smoking. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because there was a previous conversation where they joked about having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a long-term relationship and felt that the author didn't communicate with her about the sleepover. Even though the author didn't mean to do anything wrong, not informing her could be a breach of trust. Also, the fact that they had previous discussions about threesomes (even if just joking) might have made her feel insecure or like he was considering it seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything with Annie. They were in his room, but it was a social gathering that ended up with them both falling asleep. The girlfriend brought up past incidents where Annie was affectionate, which the author didn't realize were uncomfortable for her. So maybe the author didn't notice Annie's overstepping boundaries, but he also didn't do anything on his part to encourage it.\n\nThe key points are communication and boundaries. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, which could be seen as neglecting to consider her feelings. Even if it was a casual sleepover, not discussing it with her might have been a mistake. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from past conversations and her own insecurities. The author might not be at fault for not realizing Annie's actions were crossing lines, but maybe he should have checked in with his girlfriend more.\n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author isn't the sole person in the wrong, but he could have communicated better. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be proportionate given her feelings and the context of their past discussions. So maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in communication. But according to the question, it's a yes or no. So based on the details, I'd lean towards B because he didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but there's a communication aspect. But some might argue A if they think he should have been more aware of his girlfriend's feelings and discussed the sleepover beforehand.\n"
