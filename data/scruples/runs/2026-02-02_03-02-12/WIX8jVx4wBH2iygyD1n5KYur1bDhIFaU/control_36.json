One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sleepover with his 22-year-old female friend, Annie, in his room while his girlfriend was at a concert. They were hanging out before a party, got high, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next day and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate in ways that might have crossed boundaries, and there was a previous conversation about threesomes where the author jokingly mentioned Annie. Now the author feels like the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, so trust and boundaries are important. Even if the author didn't intend anything inappropriate, allowing a friend to sleep in his bed could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since they had discussed boundaries before. The fact that they had a previous conversation about threesomes (even if not serious) and the author mentioned Annie there might have planted seeds of insecurity. The girlfriend brought up past behaviors (like holding hands and playing with hair) that the author didn't realize were bothering her. So, maybe she felt those actions, combined with the sleepover and the past comment, were signs of disrespect or lack of attention to her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong. He thought the sleepover was harmless, and Annie was in a long-term relationship too. The girlfriend admitted he didn't act wrongly but that he didn't notice her discomfort. So, maybe the issue is more about communication and the girlfriend's feelings of being overlooked. The author might have been unaware of how his actions affected her, which is a common relationship issue. However, friends sleeping over in the same bed, even if they're both in relationships, can be a gray area. It depends on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't check with his girlfriend before the sleepover, which could be a mistake. Even if it was innocent, not discussing it with her shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might be proportional if she feels her boundaries were disrespected, especially with the prior context of the threesome joke. The author's hyper-awareness now suggests he's trying to adjust, but the initial oversight could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the girlfriend is overreacting without clear prior communication of boundaries, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But generally, in relationships, transparency about social interactions is important. So, the author might share some responsibility, but it's a nuanced situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he didn't act with ill intent, but there's room for A if not considering boundaries properly. Hmm.\n"
