One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his female friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend, Annie, came over for a few drinks before a party. They ended up in his room watching TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset, especially because of previous instances where Annie had touched the author (like playing with his hair, holding his hand). She also mentioned a past conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nThe author is conflicted because he didn't think his actions were wrong since he didn't initiate anything, but he now feels hyper-aware and worried about his friendship with Annie. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be about his lack of awareness of her feelings and the fact that Annie was someone they had previously joked about in a sexual context.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key factors here are communication and respect for the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, the fact that he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend is a problem. Trust and communication are crucial in a relationship. By not checking in with his girlfriend about hanging out with Annie, especially given the past jokes about threesomes, he may have overlooked her insecurities. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the lack of communication and consideration for her feelings could be seen as a mistake. However, it's also possible the girlfriend is overreacting, especially if the author had no intention of being secretive. But from a relationship perspective, transparency is important. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication.\n"
