One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, without informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend was upset not just about the sleepover but also about past interactions where Annie might have crossed boundaries, and there's a mention of a past conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of relationships and what's considered acceptable. The author didn't intentionally do anything to harm the relationship, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings when Annie stayed over. Even though it was a spur-of-the-moment decision, not informing the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust or transparency, which is important in relationships.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by the previous conversation about threesomes. Even if it was joked about, mentioning a specific person in that context could make the girlfriend feel insecure. The author not noticing the signs that his actions bothered her suggests a lack of awareness or communication. In relationships, partners often expect each other to be mindful of their feelings and to communicate openly about boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. He thought nothing of the sleepover at first, which shows he might not have realized the importance of checking in with his girlfriend about such things. The fact that the girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie might have overstepped indicates that there were previous concerns he didn't address, which might have contributed to her current feelings.\n\nThe key points are: intention vs. impact, communication, and respecting boundaries. The author's lack of awareness and communication might have led to the girlfriend feeling overlooked or disrespected. However, the author's actions weren't deliberate, so it's a gray area. The answer would depend on whether the lack of communication and consideration for the girlfriend's feelings is seen as the author's fault.\n"
