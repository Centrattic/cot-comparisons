One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. So, the author had a sleepover with their female friend Annie, who fell asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes involving Annie. The author is conflicted because he didn't mean to do anything wrong but now feels his girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the girlfriend's feelings of betrayal or discomfort. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the fact that Annie was in his bed could be seen as crossing a boundary in the relationship. The girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie overstepped, like holding his hand and playing with his hair when the girlfriend was nearby. Those actions, even if innocent, might have made her feel insecure.\n\nThen there's the part about joking about threesomes. Even if they weren't serious, mentioning Annie specifically could have triggered the girlfriend's insecurities. She might feel that the author's thoughts or jokes imply a level of attraction or interest in Annie that he didn't realize was problematic. The author didn't ask his girlfriend before having Annie over, which could be a breach of communication. In a relationship, partners usually expect to be consulted about such situations to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate anything. He didn't plan the sleepover, and Annie's presence was due to a friend bailing. So maybe he didn't act with malicious intent. The problem is more about the girlfriend's feelings and the lack of communication. The author might have failed to recognize how his actions could affect her, even if unintentionally. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, it's important to consider your partner's feelings and maintain open communication. Even if unintentional, the situation could have been handled better by informing his girlfriend beforehand. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt insecure, especially with the prior jokes about threesomes. The author's guilt or fear about the friendship with Annie is a different matter, but the main issue is his responsibility to his girlfriend's trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend and didn't consider her perspective, even if unintentionally. But there's also a case for B if the situation was a misunderstanding and the author had no malicious intent. However, in relationship dynamics, actions that affect the partner's trust often require accountability. So leaning towards A.\n"
