One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation involves a guy who had a friend (Annie) over, they ended up in his bed, and his girlfriend got upset about it. \n\nFirst, the key points. The author and Annie were at his place, drank, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later, and while she said he didn't do anything wrong, she was upset because he didn't consider her feelings. Also, there's a past conversation where the author jokingly mentioned Annie for a threesome.\n\nSo, the main issues here are communication and boundaries. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a red flag in a relationship. Even if they had discussed threesomes jokingly before, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt her boundaries were crossed. The author might not have realized how important it was to check in with her before having another friend over, especially in a close physical setting like sharing a bed.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't initiate the sleepover. Annie came over, they ended up in the bed. The author thought it was fine, but maybe he should have considered his girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend's issue isn't just about the sleepover but also about Annie's previous actions (hair, hand-holding) that the author didn't notice were bothering her. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be at fault for the sleepover itself, but the lack of communication and not recognizing her boundaries could make him partly responsible. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt uncomfortable. So, the answer might be that the author is not entirely in the wrong (B), but he did have a responsibility to communicate better. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The main question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he didn't intend harm but failed to communicate, maybe the answer is B, but there's a nuance. The girlfriend's reaction is reasonable, but the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
