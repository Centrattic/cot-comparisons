One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the person wrote about having a sleepover with their friend Annie, who's in a relationship, and didn't tell their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because of past things she felt were inappropriate, like Annie holding the author's hand and playing with their hair while she was alone. Plus, they had a joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the author did something wrong. Well, the girlfriend felt hurt and the author didn't ask her. Even though they didn't do anything physical, sharing a bed with a friend, especially when the friend is in a relationship, can be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend's reaction includes past behaviors that the author didn't notice, which adds to the conflict. Also, the joke about threesomes involving Annie might have triggered her insecurities. The author didn't consider how his actions and previous comments could affect his girlfriend's feelings. Even if he didn't mean anything by it, not checking in with his partner and being unaware of her discomfort is a problem. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
