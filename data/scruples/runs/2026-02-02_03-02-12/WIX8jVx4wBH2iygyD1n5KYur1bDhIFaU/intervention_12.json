One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, not informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset, especially because they had a conversation where they joked about potential threesomes and he mentioned the same friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The key points are: the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, but he didn't consider how his actions might affect his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't mean any harm. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not considering his girlfriend's feelings is a problem. The fact that they had a prior conversation about threesomes involving the same friend adds context. Even if it was just a joke, it might have made the girlfriend more sensitive to any interaction between him and his friend.\n\nSo, while the author might not have done anything intentionally wrong, the lack of communication and not being mindful of his girlfriend's perspective could be seen as a mistake. The question is whether that makes him \"in the wrong.\" Since the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author should have been more communicative, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but also considering that the author didn't act maliciously. However, in terms of relational responsibility, not addressing the girlfriend's concerns proactively could be a fault. So, the answer is A.\n"
