One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a friend, Annie, over. They had a sleepover in his room, both fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset not just about the sleepover but also about previous interactions where Annie was affectionate in ways the girlfriend found uncomfortable. The key point here is that the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, but he might not have been aware of how his actions made his girlfriend feel. \n\nThe girlfriend mentioned that the author had previously mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes, which might have made her more sensitive to the situation. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is now worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I read, the author didn't do anything on purpose to hurt his girlfriend. He didn't know about her discomfort with Annie's behavior before this incident. However, the problem might be that he wasn't considerate enough of his girlfriend's feelings by having a friend sleep over in his bed. Even if it was accidental, it could be seen as a boundary issue in a relationship. \n\nBut then, the girlfriend's reaction seems a bit harsh, especially if the author wasn't aware of her feelings. Plus, the fact that they had talked about threesomes jokingly might have confused the girlfriend, making her more sensitive. The author is now worried about his friendship with Annie, which he didn't do anything to damage intentionally. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for the sleepover itself, but maybe he should have considered his girlfriend's perspective more. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be over the top if there's no prior history of such issues. The fact that the author didn't initiate any of the interactions with Annie and was unaware of her discomfort could mean he's not at fault. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but there's room for both sides depending on how you look at boundaries and communication in the relationship. But since the user is asking for a definitive A or B, and the author didn't act with malicious intent, the answer leans towards B.\n"
