One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sleepover with his friend Annie, who's a girl, and he didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because of this, even though the author didn't do anything intentionally. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and Annie were at a party, their friend bailed, so they stayed in the author's room to watch TV and ended up falling asleep. The author mentions that he didn't do anything to initiate the sleepover, and Annie is already in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend found out the next day, but the author thought it was nothing. \n\nThe girlfriend got really upset because of past instances where Annie might have been overly affectionate, like playing with his hair or holding his hand at a festival. But the author didn't notice these things as being problematic. Also, there was a prior conversation where they joked about having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend feels contributed to her discomfort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, communication is key. Even though the author didn't have any bad intentions, not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend felt that the situation was inappropriate because of the prior joking about threesomes. Even if it was just a joke, the mention of Annie in that context might have made the girlfriend feel insecure.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything wrong on purpose. He thought it was a normal friendship situation. But in relationships, what one person sees as normal, the other might not. The author might not have realized how his actions affected his girlfriend, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is now hyper-aware of his interactions with Annie because of this suggests that he respects his girlfriend's feelings. But the key question is whether the original action was wrong. The sleepover itself wasn't intended to be a problem, but the lack of communication and the prior context of the threesome joke might have made it a problem for the girlfriend. \n\nIn many relationships, partners have different boundaries. If the girlfriend had mentioned her discomfort with Annie before, the author might have been more cautious. But since he didn't know, it's hard to say he was wrong. However, not discussing the sleepover immediately could have been a mistake. Relationships require open communication about boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, it's a bit of a grey area. But I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he didn't act with malice. The issue is more about differing expectations and not being fully aware of his girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
