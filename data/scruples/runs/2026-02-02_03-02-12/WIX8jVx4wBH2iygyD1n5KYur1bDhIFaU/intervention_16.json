One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves having a female friend sleep over in his bed while his girlfriend found out and is upset. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author is male, 21, and his girlfriend is 20. They've been together two years. His friend Annie, 22, who's in a relationship, comes over, drinks, parties, then falls asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out the next day. She was upset not just about the sleepover but also past instances where Annie touched the author (hair, hand) while the girlfriend was nearby. The author mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome conversation, which the girlfriend interpreted as a red flag.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective: She's in a two-year relationship and feels her partner's actions are dismissive of her feelings. Even if the author didn't intend anything, not asking her about the sleepover could be seen as a lack of consideration. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly and he mentioned Annie might have triggered her insecurities. Her reaction is about feeling overlooked and not having her boundaries respected. She's pointing out past behaviors that she found concerning, which the author didn't realize were bothering her. That suggests she felt her concerns weren't being acknowledged, leading to the current issue.\n\nFrom the author's side: He didn't intend anything inappropriate. He thought the sleepover was innocent, and Annie didn't do anything to suggest otherwise. He didn't realize his actions were causing her discomfort. He felt the situation was blown out of proportion, especially since he had no ill intent. He's worried about his friendship with Annie now.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics: Trust and communication are key. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the act of having another woman in his bed without consulting his girlfriend could be a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction points to her feeling that her feelings weren't taken seriously. The author's not noticing her discomfort in past instances might have contributed to her current feelings. The mention of Annie in a threesome joke, even if not serious, could be seen as a boundary issue.\n\nBut then again, the author didn't ask Annie over to make the girlfriend upset. The situation was spontaneous, and he thought nothing of it afterward. He might not have realized how sensitive the girlfriend was about this. The key here is intent vs. impact. The author's intent was innocent, but the impact on his girlfriend was hurtful. In relationships, intent matters, but impact can't be ignored. If the girlfriend feels her boundaries are being crossed, even unintentionally, that's a problem.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction seems to be based on past behaviors and a specific conversation about threesomes. Maybe she felt the author was more open to those scenarios than he realized, making the sleepover with Annie more problematic. It's possible she's projecting past insecurities onto this new situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If we go by the fact that he didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover and didn't consider her feelings, maybe. But he didn't have malicious intent. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction is valid if she felt her boundaries were disrespected. But is the author at fault for not anticipating her feelings? Relationships require communication. If the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort about Annie's behavior, the author should have been more aware. However, if she hadn't communicated that clearly, it's a communication issue on both sides.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for the actions themselves but could be for not being more attentive to his girlfriend's feelings in the past. However, the girlfriend's reaction might be a valid expression of her needs. The answer hinges on whether the author should have known better despite not having ill intent. Since he didn't act with malice but failed to consider her perspective, he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in communication. The answer is B (No).\n"
