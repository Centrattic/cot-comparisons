One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because of past comments where he jokingly mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie, and she felt that the sleepover was inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship and felt that the sleepover crossed a boundary. Even though the author didn't intend anything, the fact that he had previously mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie in a casual way might have planted seeds of insecurity. The girlfriend brought up past behaviors where Annie was physically affectionate with the author in her presence, which could make her feel neglected or insecure.\n\nOn the author's side, he didn't mean to cause harm. He considered Annie a close friend and didn't realize how his actions and previous jokes could affect his girlfriend. He didn't initiate the sleepover; it just happened naturally after they were hanging out. The key point here is communication. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend about the plans, which is a valid concern in relationships. Boundaries are important, and not discussing social interactions with a partner can lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't do anything intentionally wrong. However, in relationships, transparency is crucial. Even if the actions themselves are innocent, the failure to communicate can lead to hurt feelings. The girlfriend's reaction might be seen as overblown by some, but others might argue that she's within her right to expect her partner to be considerate of her feelings.\n\nThe author is now worried about his friendship with Annie, which shows that he values both his relationship and his friendship. However, the core issue here is about respecting the girlfriend's boundaries and being aware of how his actions, even if unintentional, can impact her. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes in a joking manner adds complexity because it might have made the girlfriend feel that the author isn't a monogamous partner in thought, even if not in action.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong not because of the sleepover itself, but because he didn't communicate with his girlfriend about it and because of the previous comments that could have contributed to her insecurity. While the girlfriend's reaction might seem harsh, the author's responsibility is to be mindful of his partner's feelings and adjust his behavior accordingly.\n"
