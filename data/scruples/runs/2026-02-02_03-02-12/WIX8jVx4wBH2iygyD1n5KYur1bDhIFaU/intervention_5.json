One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with a female friend, and his girlfriend is upset about it. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy had a friend, Annie, who came over to have drinks before a party. They ended up in his room, watched TV, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned that Annie had other instances where she crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand at a festival when the girlfriend was walking behind. Also, there was a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the guy mentioned Annie.\n\nThe guy feels that the girlfriend is overreacting because he didn't initiate anything with Annie and had no intention of it. But he's worried about their friendship now.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, boundaries are important. Even if the guy didn't have intentions, having another person sleep in his bed could be seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend might feel insecure or that her trust is being tested. The fact that there were prior instances where Annie crossed boundaries adds to the girlfriend's concerns. Also, the joke about threesomes with Annie might have made the situation more sensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy didn't do anything intentionally wrong. He didn't plan to have Annie over, and it was an accident. He informed his girlfriend the next day, which is honest. But maybe he should have considered how his actions might affect his girlfriend's feelings, especially given their past conversations. He might not have realized the impact of his actions, but he should have been more aware of her feelings given their history.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the girlfriend feels hurt and the guy wasn't mindful of her feelings, even if unintentionally, he might share some responsibility. But if the girlfriend's reaction is disproportionate given the circumstances, maybe she's overreacting. However, in relationships, it's about mutual respect and boundaries. If the guy wasn't aware of her feelings, he might not be entirely at fault. But he should have been more considerate of her perspective. \n\nHmm. The answer might be a bit nuanced. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's main issue is about the boundary crossing and not being informed, then the author might have made a mistake in not being more considerate. But since he didn't do it on purpose, maybe not. I'm a bit conflicted here. \n\nI think the key points are: the girlfriend's feelings are valid if she feels her boundaries are crossed. The author should have considered her feelings more, especially given their past discussions. Even if unintentional, not being aware of her concerns could make him partially at fault. But he didn't do anything malicious. So maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong), but there's a middle ground. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about her feelings, and if he failed to consider that, maybe he's not in the wrong but should have been more attentive. The question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the girlfriend is right. Since he didn't act with intent, the answer is B.\n"
