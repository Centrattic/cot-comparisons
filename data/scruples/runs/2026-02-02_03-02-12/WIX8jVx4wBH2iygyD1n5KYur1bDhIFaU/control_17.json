One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a male friend where a female friend fell asleep in their bed, and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author's friend Annie came over, they had drinks, went to watch TV in his room (which is in the university), smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. The author didn't think it was a big deal initially but the girlfriend had other concerns, like Annie's previous behavior (playing with hair, holding hands) and a prior joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nThe girlfriend felt it was inappropriate because of those past interactions. The author now feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In many relationships, boundaries are important. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling that her partner didn't consider her feelings, especially given their past discussions. Even if the author didn't intend anything wrong, not communicating with his girlfriend about plans involving friends can be a point of contention. The fact that they had joked about threesomes with Annie adds another layer, as it might have made the girlfriend feel insecure or that the author was open to such scenarios, which she might not be comfortable with now.\n\nThe author's mistake was not checking in with his girlfriend about his plans. Even if the sleepover was innocent, the lack of communication could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's concerns about Annie's past behavior suggest that there were prior red flags the author didn't address, which could have been mitigated by open discussion.\n\nHowever, the author didn't intend to cross any boundaries. But in relationships, perception matters. The girlfriend felt hurt and the author's prior mention of Annie in a threesome joke might have compounded her anxiety. The author's guilt might stem from not recognizing how his actions affected her, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. The act itself might not be inherently wrong, but the lack of communication and not being mindful of the girlfriend's feelings based on past interactions could make him at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his plans, which led to the girlfriend's hurt feelings, even if unintentionally.\n"
