One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room, and his girlfriend got upset about it. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and whether the author crossed any lines.\n\nFirst, the author and Annie ended up sleeping in the same bed after a night of drinking and hanging out. The girlfriend found out and was upset. The author didn't think much of it at first. The girlfriend mentioned that the author didn't initiate anything, but he didn't realize she was bothered by the friend's behavior before this incident. Also, there was a prior conversation where the author mentioned Annie in the context of potential threesomes, which the girlfriend felt was a catalyst for her current feelings.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication and boundaries are crucial. The author didn't explicitly ask his girlfriend if it was okay for Annie to sleep over. However, they both went to the TV room (which is in the author's room) and fell asleep together. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling that the friend was overstepping boundaries, which the author wasn't aware of. The author also mentioned that he didn't have any malicious intent and that the friend's actions (like playing with hair or holding hands) were things he didn't perceive as problematic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, not discussing with the girlfriend about having another friend over, especially in a shared sleeping space, could be seen as a breach of trust or boundaries. However, the author didn't have ill intentions and wasn't aware of the girlfriend's discomfort with Annie's behavior. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt that the situation crossed a line she hadn't communicated clearly before. The prior joke about threesomes might have influenced her perspective, even if it was meant in a lighthearted way.\n\nThe author's fault might be not being more attentive to his girlfriend's possible discomfort and not setting clearer boundaries with his friend. But if the girlfriend didn't previously express these concerns, it's possible she's now projecting her feelings onto a past situation. However, the author should have considered the girlfriend's feelings and maybe should have discussed the sleepover in advance. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is only now bringing up the previous jokes about threesomes, it might be that she's using that as a way to justify her current distress. The author might not be in the wrong if he didn't act with ill intent and wasn't aware of her boundaries. But the fact that he didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover is a point against him. In a relationship, transparency is important, even if the actions themselves are innocent. So the answer might be that the author is somewhat at fault for not considering his girlfriend's feelings proactively, but not entirely in the wrong given the lack of malicious intent.\n"
