One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not asking his girlfriend about the sleepover with his friend. The situation involves the author, his girlfriend, and a female friend. The girlfriend got upset because the friend slept in his bed, which he didn't ask about, and there's a history of discussing hypothetical threesomes.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author didn't inform his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if they had discussed threesomes hypothetically before, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. The fact that the friend had previously crossed boundaries (like playing with his hair and holding hands) might have contributed to her reaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's seriousness in discussing her feelings shows she felt her boundaries were violated. The author's lack of awareness about how his actions affected her could indicate he wasn't considerate enough. Also, the fact that they had talked about threesomes might have made her more sensitive to this situation, even if it wasn't serious at the time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the situation and thought nothing of it initially. The friend fell asleep in his room after they both went to bed, which might not be intentional. However, not considering his girlfriend's perspective and not communicating openly could be seen as his fault. The main issue here is the lack of communication and not being mindful of his girlfriend's feelings, even if the actions themselves weren't malicious.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt her, the failure to communicate and consider her feelings makes him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
