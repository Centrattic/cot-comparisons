One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend in his room, not informing his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and mentioned this friend. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about affecting his friendship with the friend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friends were going to a party, the friend bailed, so they stayed in the guy's room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't there that night. The author didn't inform her. The girlfriend later brings up past instances where the friend was affectionate. Also, they had joked about threesomes involving that friend, which might have contributed to her feelings.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamics perspective, even if the author didn't do anything intentional, not communicating with the girlfriend about a sleepover in his room is a potential issue. Partners often expect some level of transparency, especially regarding close friends sleeping over. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling she wasn't considered important enough to be informed, which is a common insecurity in relationships. The mention of previous jokes about threesomes could have made her feel her boundaries were disrespected, even if it was just in jest.\n\nThe author might think he did nothing wrong, but the crux here is communication and how the girlfriend felt. The girlfriend had valid feelings about being left out of the loop and the friend's previous behaviors making her uncomfortable. The author should have considered her perspective and discussed the sleepover with her, even if he didn't see it as a big deal.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but he needs to recognize the importance of communication and his girlfriend's feelings, even if his actions were innocent. The main issue here is the lack of communication rather than the act itself. Therefore, the author isn't at fault, but he should work on addressing the communication gap to prevent future issues.\n"
