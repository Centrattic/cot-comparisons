One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie came over to his room, they watched TV, smoked pot, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out later and felt it was inappropriate, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes involving Annie. The girlfriend is upset because of the potential for boundary issues and the history of discussing threesomes, even if it was just in a hypothetical way.\n\nSo, the key points here are whether the author's actions crossed any boundaries the girlfriend had, and if the girlfriend overreacted. The author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, like having a sexual relationship or being intimate with Annie. However, the fact that Annie was in his bed without the girlfriend's knowledge, combined with previous jokes about threesomes, might have made the girlfriend feel insecure or disrespected.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as a lack of consideration for her feelings. Even if the action itself was innocent, the context (previous jokes about threesomes) might have made the girlfriend feel that the author was not respecting her boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction, while maybe intense, could stem from her need for reassurance and trust in the relationship. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for the specific action of having the sleepover, but he did fail to consider how it would affect his girlfriend. The fact that he didn't notice her being bothered before might indicate a lack of attention to her emotional state. So, while he didn't act with malice, he could be in the wrong for not being more mindful of his girlfriend's perspective and for not communicating about the situation beforehand.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be disproportionate if she's bringing up past issues that weren't previously discussed. The author's intent was innocent, and the situation wasn't a secret, as he told her the next day. However, the context of the threesome jokes adds complexity. It's possible that the girlfriend's anger isn't just about the sleepover but about feeling that the author's actions could lead to something they discussed hypothetically. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's mistake might be in not being more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings given the context, but the girlfriend's reaction could also be seen as overreaching. However, since the question is about the author being in the wrong, it's more about whether his actions were inappropriate. Given that he had no intention of harming the relationship and the situation was a slip-up, he might not be entirely at fault. But because of the context and his failure to consider her feelings, there's a case for him being in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the action itself was innocent, but with the context, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the answer could be A. Hmm, this is tricky.\n"
