One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room after a party, and his girlfriend found out and was upset. The author didn't think to ask his girlfriend beforehand, and now he's feeling like his girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author and his girlfriend have been together for two years, and they often talk about hypothetical threesomes, including mentioning Annie. That might be a red flag in the relationship. Even if they're joking, if the girlfriend finds this offensive or uncomfortable, it could be a problem. The author might be contributing to the issue by bringing up ideas that make his girlfriend feel insecure or disrespected.\n\nThen there's the sleepover itself. The author and Annie ended up in his room, fell asleep, and he didn't inform his girlfriend. Even if it's innocent, not communicating with his girlfriend about such things can be a problem. Trust is important in relationships, and not checking in with your partner about plans involving friends can lead to misunderstandings or hurt feelings. The girlfriend might feel neglected or that her trust is being violated, even if there's no actual infidelity.\n\nThe girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand or playing with his hair while the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't notice these things, which shows he might not be attentive to his girlfriend's feelings in those situations. Even if he didn't have ill intentions, his actions could be making his girlfriend feel insecure or overlooked.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and he didn't have any intention of being inappropriate. He might genuinely not see why the girlfriend is upset, especially if their jokes about threesomes were meant in a playful way. But in relationships, even if something is meant as a joke, it can still affect the other person's feelings if they perceive it as a boundary being crossed.\n\nSo, considering all these points: the lack of communication about the sleepover, the past jokes about threesomes, and the girlfriend's valid concerns about Annie's behavior, the author might be at fault for not being more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings and for not maintaining clear communication and boundaries in the relationship. Even if his intentions were good, his actions contributed to the girlfriend's distress.\n"
