One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, who was in a long-term relationship herself. The girlfriend found out and was upset, especially because there was a prior conversation where the author mentioned Annie as someone they'd consider for a threesome, even if it was just in a joking way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't invite Annie over with the intention of anything inappropriate. They had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with friends and didn't know about this. The author told her the next day but didn't think much of it. However, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate and brought up past instances where Annie might have overstepped, like playing with hair or holding hands. The author didn't see those actions as problematic, but the girlfriend was upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are the boundaries in the relationship. The girlfriend felt the sleepover was inappropriate, and the prior conversation about threesomes involving Annie probably made her feel insecure. Even if the author didn't mean anything by the past comments, mentioning another woman in that context could have planted seeds of insecurity. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's entitled to feel upset if her partner's actions make her uncomfortable, especially if there's a history of that type of talk.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't have intentions of doing anything wrong, but the action of having a friend over in the bed when the girlfriend is not present could be seen as a breach of boundaries. Relationships require communication and respecting each other's comfort levels. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, not considering the girlfriend's perspective and how it made her feel is a misstep. The prior conversation about threesomes also adds context\u2014maybe the girlfriend felt the author was more open to such scenarios, making the sleepover more concerning.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate anything with Annie, and Annie was in a relationship herself. The main issue is the lack of communication and awareness of the girlfriend's boundaries. The author should have considered how the girlfriend might react and perhaps discussed it beforehand. The fact that the girlfriend was upset about past interactions that the author didn't notice shows a communication gap.\n\nSo, while the author may not have intended harm, the actions and prior comments did contribute to the girlfriend's discomfort. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for not being more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings and boundaries.\n"
