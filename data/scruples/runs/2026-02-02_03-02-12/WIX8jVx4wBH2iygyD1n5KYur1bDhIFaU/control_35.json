One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, Annie, in his room after a party. His girlfriend found out and got upset, citing past instances where Annie might have overstepped. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author did something wrong by allowing his girlfriend to sleep in his bed without informing her. The girlfriend was already at a concert with a friend, and they had decided not to go to the party. The author didn't think to tell her that Annie was staying over. \n\nIn relationships, communication and trust are important. Even if the author didn't have intentions, not informing his girlfriend about a friend sleeping in his bed could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by the past comments about threesomes, which adds to her insecurity. \n\nThe author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he was aware of Annie's presence in his room. The fact that they had discussed threesomes jokingly about Annie might have made the girlfriend especially sensitive. The author's failure to notice her discomfort until she brought it up could be a sign of not being attentive to her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. He thought the situation was innocent. However, in relationships, partners often expect their significant others to inform them about friends staying over, especially in the bedroom. Not doing so can lead to misunderstandings and hurt feelings. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's reaction might seem extreme, the author did have a responsibility to communicate about Annie's presence. The answer likely leans towards the author being at least somewhat in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's perspective and not informing her. But it's also about the girlfriend's overreaction based on past jokes. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't communicate, which is a relationship expectation, he might be in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't initiate the sleepover. Annie came over, drinks happened, and they fell asleep. The author didn't plan it. But still, after the fact, not informing his girlfriend could be a mistake. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate, which is important in relationships. But some might say the girlfriend overreacted, making it a B. But the key is whether the author was wrong. Since he didn't check in with his girlfriend about having a friend over, even if it was accidental, it's a breach of communication. So answer A.\n"
