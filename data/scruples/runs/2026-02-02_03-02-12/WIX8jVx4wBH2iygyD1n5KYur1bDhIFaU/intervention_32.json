One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The scenario involves a few key points.\n\nFirst, the author's friend Annie came over, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together in his room. The girlfriend found out later and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie touched the author, which he didn't think much of. Also, there was a prior joke about threesomes involving Annie, which the author had mentioned.\n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to do anything wrong, the fact that his girlfriend was upset suggests that her feelings are valid. The main issue here is about boundaries and how each partner perceives them. The author might not see the problem, but the girlfriend feels that the situation was inappropriate, especially given the previous comments about threesomes. \n\nThe author's defense is that he didn't initiate anything and that he thought nothing of it. However, in relationships, what one person sees as innocent, another might see as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is partly due to the prior conversation about threesomes, which adds context. Even if it was a joke, it shows that there's a history that makes this incident more sensitive for her.\n\nAdditionally, the author's friend Annie was in a long-term relationship herself, which might not be the main point, but it's worth noting. The key here is whether the author should have considered his girlfriend's feelings and communicated more clearly. Even if he didn't mean to cross a line, the act of not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover could be seen as neglecting to respect her boundaries.\n\nIn terms of the friendship with Annie, the author is now hyper-aware of his actions, which affects their friendship. But the root cause is the girlfriend's concern. The author might need to work on communication with both his girlfriend and Annie to ensure everyone's boundaries are respected.\n\nSo, considering all these points, even if the author didn't have bad intentions, the situation could be seen as a misstep in communication and respect for the girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being at least partially in the wrong.\n"
