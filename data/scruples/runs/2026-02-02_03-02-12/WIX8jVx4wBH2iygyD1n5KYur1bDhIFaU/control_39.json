One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The situation involves the author (a guy) having a sleepover with his friend Annie (22F) in his room, where they both fell asleep. His girlfriend later got upset about it. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author didn't ask his girlfriend about this sleepover first. He thought it was nothing, but his girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. The girlfriend also brought up past incidents where Annie acted in ways that made her uncomfortable, like holding his hand at a festival. Additionally, the author mentioned in a previous conversation that he'd consider a threesome with Annie, which the girlfriend found hurtful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider relationship boundaries. In most relationships, couples have certain boundaries about interactions with others, especially friends of the opposite sex. The author didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a breach of trust or boundary. Even if he had no intentions, not checking in with his girlfriend first might be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction includes past behavior. If the author was aware of Annie's previous actions (like holding hands) and maybe even acknowledged them in a way that the girlfriend found troubling (like joking about threesomes), then the girlfriend has valid concerns. The fact that the author mentioned Annie in the context of a threesome, even if it was just a joke, could make the girlfriend feel insecure or disrespected.\n\nHowever, the author didn't initiate the overstepping; he was just friends with Annie. But in a relationship, partners need to be mindful of each other's feelings and communicate. Not discussing the sleepover and not recognizing the girlfriend's concerns until later might be where he went wrong. Even if the act itself was innocent, the lack of communication and awareness of his girlfriend's feelings could be seen as his fault.\n\nSo, the girlfriend's anger is understandable given the context. The author might not have done anything intentionally wrong, but his lack of communication and awareness of his girlfriend's boundaries could place some responsibility on him. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and didn't communicate, even if his actions were innocent.\n"
