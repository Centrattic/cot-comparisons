One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend without asking their girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author (21M) has a close friend Annie (22F) who's in a long-term relationship. They had drinks, watched TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend (20F) was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, he told her, and initially, he didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend confronted him about it, bringing up other instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand while the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend. The girlfriend pointed out that he didn't do anything wrong himself but didn't notice how she felt. She was upset because they had jokingly discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie in that context.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants to know the community's take.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The author didn't initiate the sleepover, it was Annie. They fell asleep together, but the author didn't act on it. The girlfriend was upset not just about that incident but other past behaviors that the author didn't realize were making her uncomfortable. The girlfriend's main issue seems to be that the author didn't recognize her feelings and the previous boundary crossings. Also, the mention of threesomes and the author bringing up Annie in that context might have made the situation more sensitive.\n\nIn relationships, communication and awareness of each other's feelings are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt his girlfriend, the fact that he didn't notice her discomfort in past interactions could be a point. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her boundaries were being crossed, even if the author didn't mean harm. The key here is whether the author should have been more aware of how his actions, even if unintentional, affected his girlfriend.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in terms of direct misconduct, but he could be at fault for not being more attentive to his girlfriend's feelings and the cumulative effect of Annie's behaviors. The girlfriend's perspective is valid, and the author's hyper-awareness now might be a sign that he's starting to understand her concerns better now.\n"
