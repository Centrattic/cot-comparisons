One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a sleepover with his female friend Annie, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset about it. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and Annie had a sleepover. They were hanging out, drinking, smoking, and fell asleep. The author didn't think to tell his girlfriend. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The author didn't mention this until the next day. The girlfriend then confronted him, feeling it was inappropriate, especially considering past instances where Annie crossed boundaries. Also, there's this conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie, which is probably why the girlfriend is more sensitive now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by not informing his girlfriend about the sleepover? In relationships, communication is key. Even if it's a casual sleepover, not letting the girlfriend know could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend felt her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't mean anything by it. Also, the fact that they had discussed threesomes in the past might have made the girlfriend more anxious about the situation.\n\nThe author argues that he didn't initiate anything with Annie and that he thought nothing of it. But the girlfriend's feelings matter too. Even if the author didn't do anything wrong in his eyes, not considering how his actions made his girlfriend feel is a problem. Also, the fact that he's now hyper-aware and worried about his friendship with Annie might indicate that his actions had consequences.\n\nAnnie was in a long-term relationship herself, so maybe the girlfriend felt that the author was being too friendly with someone who's also in a relationship. But the main issue here is the lack of communication and not respecting the girlfriend's boundaries. Even if there was no physical contact beyond falling asleep, the act of having a sleepover without discussing it with the girlfriend could be seen as a mistake.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and not being considerate of his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend had valid concerns about past behavior and the mention of threesomes, which the author didn't address properly. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes).\n"
