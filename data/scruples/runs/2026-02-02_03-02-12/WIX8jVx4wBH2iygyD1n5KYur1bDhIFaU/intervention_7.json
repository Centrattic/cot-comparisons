One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend is upset about it. \n\nFirst, the guy and his friend Annie were hanging out, got high, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend wasn't there and found out the next day. The girlfriend is upset because Annie has previously done things like playing with his hair and holding his hand when she was nearby. Also, they had joked about threesomes and he mentioned Annie. \n\nThe guy didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but his girlfriend feels uncomfortable. The key points here are communication and boundaries. The guy didn't ask his girlfriend before the sleepover, which could be an issue. Even if it was accidental, not informing her might have caused problems. \n\nThe girlfriend brought up past behaviors that she found concerning. The guy didn't realize these actions bothered her, which shows a lack of awareness about her feelings. Even though he didn't mean anything by it, the fact that he didn't consider her perspective might be a problem. \n\nAlso, the mention of joking about threesomes with Annie could have triggered her insecurities. The guy might have thought it was harmless, but that conversation could have made the situation more sensitive. \n\nSo, the guy might not be intentionally wrong, but he didn't communicate properly or consider his girlfriend's feelings enough. The girlfriend is in a relationship where trust and communication are important. The guy's actions, while not malicious, could be seen as neglecting her emotional needs. Therefore, he might be partially at fault for not addressing her concerns sooner or being more mindful of their boundaries.\n"
