One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy having a sleepover with his female friend when his girlfriend was out. They ended up falling asleep together in his bed. The girlfriend was upset because the friend had previously crossed boundaries in small ways (like holding hands at a festival) and the author had mentioned the friend in a hypothetical threesome conversation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author didn't invite his girlfriend over that night; she was at a concert. He didn't initiate anything with Annie. The girlfriend felt uncomfortable because of prior incidents and the mention of the friend in a threesome context. He didn't realize she was bothered until she brought it up. Now he's worried his behavior affected his friendship with Annie.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is based on feeling that the boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't mean anything by it. In relationships, communication and respecting boundaries are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The fact that he mentioned the friend in a threesome discussion, even jokingly, might have contributed to her insecurity. However, the sleepover itself was a result of a friend bailing, and they were just hanging out and got tired. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that he didn't act with malicious intent and the situation was accidental, but the girlfriend's feelings are legitimate, it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the author didn't intentionally overstep and was unaware of her discomfort until she explained, it's possible he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that in a relationship, even unintentional actions that make a partner uncomfortable can be seen as a slight. However, the answer might lean towards B (No) because the author didn't act with intent, but others might say that being with another woman in bed without discussing it with the girlfriend is a breach, regardless of intent. \n\nWait, but the girlfriend was at a concert, so maybe it's not about being with her friend when the girlfriend wasn't present. The issue is more about the boundaries in their relationship. The girlfriend's jealousy is valid, but the author's actions weren't malicious. The fact that the sleepover was accidental and not premeditated might matter. Also, the mention of the threesome joke could have planted the seed in her mind. \n\nIn many perspectives, the author isn't in the wrong if he didn't act with intent to hurt. The girlfriend's reaction is about her feelings and communication, which is important. The answer would depend on whether the action itself (sleeping in the same bed) is inherently wrong, but since it was accidental and not a sexual context, it's less clear. So probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
