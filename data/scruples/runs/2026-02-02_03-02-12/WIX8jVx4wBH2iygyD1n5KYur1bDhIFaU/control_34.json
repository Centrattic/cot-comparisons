One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend (Annie) in his room while his girlfriend (GF) wasn't there. The GF got upset about it, even though the author didn't intend anything inappropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship norms. The author and his GF have been together for two years. Trust and communication are key in any relationship. The author didn't inform his GF about the sleepover, which could be a point of contention. Even if it was just a friend sleeping over, not telling them might make the GF feel insecure or not respected.\n\nNext, the GF brought up past instances where Annie had crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand. The author didn't notice these as issues before, but the GF felt they were a problem. This suggests that the GF had prior concerns that weren't addressed, which might have contributed to her overreaction. However, the author didn't seem to acknowledge these concerns until after the incident.\n\nThe conversation about threesomes and mentioning Annie is a crucial point. Even if it was in a joking manner, it could have led the GF to feel that the author was open to the idea of being with someone else, which might affect their trust. The GF's reaction is understandable because even hypothetical discussions about sleeping with others can be hurtful in a committed relationship.\n\nThe author's feelings about being hyper-aware and fearing the loss of his friendship with Annie show that he's trying to balance both relationships. However, the main issue here is communication. The author didn't check in with his GF about the plans, and the GF felt her boundaries were being ignored. Even if the author didn't have malicious intent, the lack of communication and consideration for the GF's feelings is a problem.\n\nSo, while the author may not have intended to cause harm, not discussing the sleepover with his GF and not being attentive to her previous concerns about Annie's behavior could be seen as a breach of trust. The GF's reaction, while maybe intense, is rooted in her need for reassurance and trust in the relationship. The author's responsibility is to communicate openly and respect his partner's feelings, even if he doesn't see an issue immediately. Therefore, the author is at least partially in the wrong for not being more communicative and considerate of his GF's perspective.\n"
