One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves a guy (21M) having his close friend (22F) over, they end up in his bed, and the girlfriend (20F) finds out later and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and his friend were drinking, watching TV, smoking, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't there and found out the next day. The girlfriend is upset because she feels that the friend crosses boundaries, like holding hands and playing with hair when the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there's a prior conversation where the couple discussed threesomes jokingly, and the guy mentioned the friend. The girlfriend now thinks this affected her perception of the situation.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author did something wrong by not considering his girlfriend's feelings. The author didn't initiate anything, but he also didn't check in with his girlfriend beforehand. Even though they're in a two-year relationship, communication is key. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by past jokes about threesomes, which could make her more sensitive. The fact that he didn't realize his actions were bothering her suggests a lack of awareness. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, not discussing it with his girlfriend afterward and not being mindful of her possible discomfort could be seen as a mistake. The author is now hyper-aware and worried about his friendship, but the main issue is whether he was wrong in the first place. Since relationships require communication and consideration, not informing the partner about a situation that could be perceived as risky, especially with a friend in a long-term relationship, might be where the author went wrong. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings and didn't communicate adequately.\n"
