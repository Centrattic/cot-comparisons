One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend who's 22, and didn't inform his girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset because of this and also mentioned past interactions where the friend might have crossed boundaries. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted, especially since they had joked about threesomes before.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the sleepover. The friend came over, they ended up in the same bed, fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert. The author didn't think to inform her. The girlfriend's anger seems to stem from feeling that the author wasn't considerate of her feelings and that there's a pattern of the friend overstepping.\n\nEven if the sleepover was accidental, the fact that the author didn't communicate with his girlfriend about it could be a problem. Open communication is important in relationships. The author didn't consider how his girlfriend might feel about a female friend being in his bed, especially if there's a history of the friend crossing boundaries. The mention of joking about threesomes might have added to the girlfriend's insecurity. \n\nThe girlfriend is within her right to feel upset about not being informed and about the friend's past behavior. The author's responsibility is to be aware of his partner's feelings and respect boundaries, even if he himself didn't intend anything. So, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate and didn't take his girlfriend's perspective into account beforehand.\n\nBut maybe the girlfriend overreacted? However, the fact that she brought up past issues shows that this was a culmination of things. The author's not noticing how his actions affected her could mean he's not being attentive enough. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
