One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his female friend (Annie) and not asking his girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend feeling upset about the sleepover and past interactions where Annie might have crossed boundaries.\n\nFirst, the key points: the author and Annie were hanging out after a party, fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out the next day and felt it was inappropriate. She also mentioned previous instances where Annie's behavior made her uncomfortable, like holding hands at a festival. Additionally, there was a conversation where the author jokingly mentioned wanting to have a threesome with Annie. The girlfriend is upset because she feels these actions, even if not intentional, hurt her and made her insecure.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a relationship, communication is key. The author didn't consult his girlfriend about the sleepover. Even if it was accidental, not checking in with her could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she feels the boundaries were crossed, especially given the previous comments about threesomes. The author might not have intended harm, but the context of the prior conversation (joking about threesomes) adds a layer of insensitivity here. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't notice the girlfriend's discomfort in the past instances shows a lack of awareness of her feelings. While the author didn't initiate the sleepover, the situation being in his room and with a friend who had a history of making the girlfriend uneasy could contribute to valid hurt feelings. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't have ill intentions, the actions did impact the girlfriend's emotional state. The girlfriend's feelings are important in the relationship, and the author's failure to consider her perspective in both the sleepover and prior interactions could be seen as a mistake. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not being attuned to his girlfriend's feelings and not maintaining open communication about boundaries.\n"
