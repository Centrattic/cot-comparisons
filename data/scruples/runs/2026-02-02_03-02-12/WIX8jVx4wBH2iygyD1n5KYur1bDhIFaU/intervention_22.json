One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, and not informing their girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset about it, even though the author didn't initiate anything. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The couple has been together for two years, so trust and communication are key. The author's action\u2014having a friend sleep over in their bed\u2014might seem minor to them, but the girlfriend is clearly hurt. The girlfriend mentions past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, which the author didn't notice. That's a red flag. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, not being aware of Annie's behavior towards them could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThen there's the part about the conversation about threesomes. The author mentioned Annie in that context, which the girlfriend points out as a trigger. This history might have made the girlfriend more sensitive. Even if they were joking, bringing up partners in such a way can create insecurities or mistrust. \n\nThe author didn't ask their girlfriend before having Annie over. In a relationship, it's important to check in with each other about social interactions, especially when it involves someone the partner might be jealous of. The fact that the author didn't consider their girlfriend's feelings and didn't seek her opinion shows a lack of communication. \n\nAlso, the author now feels their friendship with Annie is affected because they're hyper-aware. That's a consequence of not handling the situation properly. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt disrespected or insecure. The author's actions, while not malicious, still caused harm. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, the lack of communication and awareness of the girlfriend's boundaries is where they're at fault. The answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's feelings and didn't maintain open communication about their social interactions.\n"
