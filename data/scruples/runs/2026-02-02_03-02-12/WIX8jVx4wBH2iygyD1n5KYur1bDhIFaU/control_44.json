One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author, a 21M, had a sleepover with his 22F friend Annie in his university room. His girlfriend, a 20F, found out and was upset. The key points here are the context of the sleepover, the girlfriend's reaction, and the past conversation about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the sleepover happened after a party cancellation. They were in the author's room, had drinks, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The author didn't think it was a big deal and only told her the next day. The girlfriend was upset because she felt the author didn't consider her feelings, especially after a previous discussion where he mentioned Annie in the context of a hypothetical threesome. \n\nThe girlfriend's main issues seem to be about the perceived lack of boundary awareness and the reference to Annie in the threesome talk. The author didn't initiate the closeness with Annie, but he might not have been aware of how his actions affected his girlfriend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication and boundaries are crucial. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the context of their past conversation could be an issue. The fact that he mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome might have made the situation more sensitive for the girlfriend. The author's lack of awareness about how his actions could be misinterpreted or make his girlfriend uncomfortable could be seen as a mistake. However, if the couple has discussed boundaries and the author didn't cross them with intent, it might not be entirely his fault. \n\nThe key here is whether the author violated any clear boundaries they had set together. If they hadn't explicitly discussed such situations, the author might not be in the wrong, but his failure to consider his girlfriend's feelings and the context of their past conversation could make him partially responsible. The girlfriend's reaction is valid due to her feelings, but the author's unawareness doesn't necessarily make him wrong. It's a communication problem rather than a clear violation. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with a note about improving communication.\n"
