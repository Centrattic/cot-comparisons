One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (a guy) had a friend, Annie, who slept over in his bed without asking his girlfriend. The girlfriend found out and was upset about it, bringing up past instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries. The author thinks his girlfriend overreacted, especially since they had joked about threesomes before, and he mentioned Annie in that context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's in a two-year relationship, and her boyfriend had a friend asleep in his bed. Even though they were just hanging out and fell asleep, it's a situation that can be seen as compromising. The girlfriend was upset not just about the sleepover but also past behaviors like Annie playing with his hair and holding his hand when she was nearby. These actions might seem innocent to the author, but to the girlfriend, they could feel like a pattern of ignoring boundaries.\n\nThe girlfriend's main issue seems to be that the author didn't notice or respect her boundaries. She mentioned that the author didn't initiate the sleepover, so he wasn't directly at fault there. However, the fact that they had previously discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. Even if the discussion was in a joking manner, it could have been a trigger for her.\n\nFrom the author's side, he didn't mean any harm and loves his girlfriend. He's now hyper-aware of his actions around Annie and fears losing the friendship. The question is whether his actions were wrong. The key points here are communication and boundaries. The author didn't communicate with his girlfriend about the sleepover, which is a big no-no in a relationship. Even if it was an accident, not discussing it could be seen as neglecting her feelings. Also, the past comments about threesomes might have contributed to the current issue, as they could have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind.\n\nNow, considering typical relationship advice, communication is crucial. The author should have informed his girlfriend about the sleepover immediately instead of the next day. Also, being aware of how his actions might affect his girlfriend is important. The fact that the girlfriend felt the need to sit him down shows that she felt her boundaries were crossed or that her concerns weren't being heard.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have overreacted by bringing up past events that the author didn't consider significant. However, in relationships, past actions can contribute to current conflicts, especially if one partner feels insecure. The author might not have realized how cumulative these incidents were for his girlfriend.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, he is partly responsible for not being more attuned to his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating better. However, he didn't intentionally do anything malicious. The girlfriend's reaction, while valid for her, might be seen as overblown if the sleepover was innocent and the other instances weren't malicious. But given the context of prior jokes about threesomes, it's understandable that the girlfriend felt uneasy.\n\nSo, weighing all this, the author might be partially at fault for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not communicating properly. But the girlfriend's reaction might also be influenced by her own insecurities. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the act itself (the sleepover) wasn't intentional and without malice, but the lack of communication and not acknowledging her feelings is a problem, the answer might be a mix. However, since the options are A or B (either yes or no), and the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong but failed to communicate, I might lean towards B (No), because the author didn't act with malice, but he should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more. Wait, but in relationships, intentions matter less than the impact. So even if he didn't mean to, the impact was negative. So maybe he's partially at fault. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but does that make him in the wrong? The answer could be that he's not in the wrong because he didn't intentionally cross boundaries, but he should have been more considerate. So perhaps B is correct. Alternatively, if the answer considers that not respecting her boundaries (even unintentionally) is wrong, then A. Hmm. It's tricky. The answer likely depends on whether the act itself is wrong regardless of intent. In relationships, sometimes things are wrong because they make your partner uncomfortable, even if unintended. So the author might be at fault for not being considerate enough, hence A. But the girlfriend's overreaction is also a factor. I'm a bit torn. Maybe the answer is B because the author didn't do it on purpose and loves his girlfriend, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he didn't act with intent, maybe B.\n"
