One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves a 21-year-old male (the author), his 22-year-old female friend Annie (in a long-term relationship), and his 20-year-old girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the key events: Annie and the author ended up sleeping in his bed after a party plans fell through. The girlfriend found out later, was upset, and brought up past instances where Annie interacted with the author in ways the girlfriend found problematic. The author didn't mean anything by it but now feels his girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nSo, from the girlfriend's perspective, trust is a big issue here. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the fact that Annie slept in his bed might make her feel insecure. Also, the past comments about threesomes and choosing Annie could have planted seeds of doubt. The girlfriend might feel that the author's actions, even if innocent, cross boundaries she hasn't clearly communicated before. That could lead to her feeling like her concerns aren't taken seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't plan the sleepover; it was an accident. He didn't initiate any of the interactions with Annie. He thought it was harmless. But the problem is that the girlfriend felt hurt and the author didn't consider her perspective beforehand. The fact that he mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes, even jokingly, might have contributed to her anxiety. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his actions, though unintentional, disregarded his girlfriend's feelings. Even if there was no intent, not being aware of her boundaries and not considering how she might feel could be seen as a mistake. The argument for the author being in the wrong would be that he should have been more attuned to her potential discomfort, especially given their previous discussions about threesomes. \n\nConversely, if the author truly had no malicious intent and the situation was an accident, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings matter, even if the author didn't mean harm. The key here is communication. The author didn't check in with his girlfriend beforehand, which led to her feeling ignored. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how your actions affect your partner, even if they're not intentional. The author might not be in the wrong for the specific incident, but he could be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and not addressing past comments that might have contributed to her anxiety. So, there's a balance here. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong for the sleepover itself, the answer might lean towards B (No), but with the caveat that better communication was needed. But given the girlfriend's valid feelings and the context of past comments, maybe A (Yes) is the answer because he should have been more mindful of how his actions could be perceived.\n"
