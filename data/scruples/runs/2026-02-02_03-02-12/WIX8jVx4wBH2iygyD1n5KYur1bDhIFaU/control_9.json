One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a male friend, Annie, who came over to his place for drinks before a party. Their friend bailed, so they stayed in the author's room, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. The next day, the author told his girlfriend about Annie sleeping in his bed. The girlfriend then brought up other instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand when she was alone. The author admitted to joking about threesomes with Annie's name mentioned, which the girlfriend found hurtful.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author didn't initiate the sleepover, but he didn't ask his girlfriend either. He didn't anticipate that this might upset her, especially given their previous discussions about threesomes. The girlfriend felt neglected and that her feelings were not considered. The author didn't check in with his GF before the sleepover, which is a common expectation in a relationship to avoid such misunderstandings.\n\nEven though the author didn't have intentions, the act of not communicating with his GF about his plans, especially involving a friend who's in a relationship, could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because the author didn't consider her feelings beforehand. The part about the threesome jokes might have compounded her feelings of insecurity. \n\nSo, while the author might not have meant anything by it, the failure to communicate and consider his GF's perspective is where he went wrong. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being mindful of her feelings and not discussing the plans with her.\n"
