One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a sleepover with a female friend who's in a relationship, and the girlfriend getting upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and his friend, Annie, had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out and was upset because the friend had previously crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. Also, there's the mention of joking about threesomes with Annie, which the girlfriend might have taken more seriously than intended.\n\nThe author didn't initiate the sleepover but didn't consider that his actions might make his girlfriend uncomfortable. Even though he didn't mean anything by it, the context of previous boundary issues and the joke about threesomes might have made the girlfriend worry about the implications. The author's friend is in a long-term relationship, so there's a potential for jealousy or insecurity on the girlfriend's part.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't think to ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Even if he thought it was innocent, not considering her perspective might be a mistake. The girlfriend's reaction could be valid if she felt her boundaries were being tested, especially with past instances.\n\nHowever, the author claims he didn't mean anything by the previous interactions and loves his girlfriend. The joke about threesomes was just playful, not serious. The main issue is whether the author was negligent in not considering how his actions might affect his girlfriend. \n\nIn many relationships, partners expect each other to be considerate of their feelings, even in seemingly harmless situations. The author might be in the wrong for not being proactive in communication and not recognizing the potential for his actions to cause distress. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting if the author's intentions were truly innocent. But relationships often involve managing each other's insecurities, so the author's failure to check in with his girlfriend could be a mistake.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and the context of past issues, leading to her justified concern.\n"
