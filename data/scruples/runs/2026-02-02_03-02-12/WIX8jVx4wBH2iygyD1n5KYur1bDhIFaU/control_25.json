One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, which his girlfriend found upsetting. The key points here are the context of the sleepover, the girlfriend's perspective, and the history of their conversations about threesomes.\n\nFirst, the sleepover happened when the girlfriend wasn't there. The author didn't ask her, which might be a point of contention. The fact that they fell asleep together after drinking and smoking could be seen as a lapse in judgment, especially if they're in a committed relationship where boundaries are important. The girlfriend was upset not just because of the sleepover but also because of previous incidents where the friend crossed boundaries, like touching hair and holding hands. The author didn't notice these things, which his girlfriend was bothered by. \n\nThen there's the conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned his friend. Even if it was a joke, bringing up a specific friend in that context might have made the girlfriend feel insecure. The girlfriend did say the author didn't do anything wrong, but the fact that he wasn't aware of her feelings and the history of their discussions might mean he's not in the wrong, but he's responsible for not addressing her concerns. However, the author now feels that the girlfriend overreacted, which could be a point of contention.\n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication and awareness of the girlfriend's feelings. The author didn't intentionally do anything harmful, but the situation could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt uncomfortable, especially with the history of threesome talks. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he didn't act with malice. It's more about a communication breakdown. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong, but he needs to be more mindful of his girlfriend's feelings.\n"
