One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with a female friend and not informing his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's friend Annie, who is in a long-term relationship, came over for drinks, then they watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend found out later, and she was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie was affectionate towards the author, which he didn't notice as issues. Also, there's a past joke about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in relationships. The author didn't intend to do anything wrong, but his actions (sleeping in the same bed, previous casual interactions) might have crossed the girlfriend's boundaries. Even if he didn't mean to, not considering her feelings and not communicating with her before the sleepover could be a problem. The girlfriend's reaction is partly because of previous unaddressed concerns, which the author didn't recognize as issues. However, the author didn't initiate the interaction with Annie and seems genuinely unaware of her discomfort. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context of their relationship and what boundaries were previously established. If they had open communication about friends and boundaries, then not informing her could be a mistake. But if this was an innocent sleepover without any intent, maybe the girlfriend overreacted. However, the fact that the author mentioned Annie in a hypothetical threesome before might contribute to his girlfriend's insecurity. \n\nThe author's main question is whether he's wrong for thinking his girlfriend overreacted and for being worried about his friendship with Annie. If the author truly didn't mean to cross any boundaries, but the girlfriend feels it's a big deal, it's more about their relationship dynamics. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of actions, but he could be in the wrong for not being more attentive to her feelings and boundaries. However, the initial action (sleeping in the same bed) might be seen as a minor mistake, but the girlfriend's reaction isn't entirely unfounded given the previous context. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but since the user asked for A or B, and the author didn't intend to do anything wrong, maybe B (No) is the choice. But some might argue A if considering the girlfriend's emotional needs. However, the author didn't have malicious intent, so B makes sense.\n"
