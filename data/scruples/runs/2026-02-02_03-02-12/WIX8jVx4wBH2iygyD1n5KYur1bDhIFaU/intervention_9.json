One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy (21M) who had a sleepover with his female friend (22F) and didn't inform his girlfriend (20F), leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his friend went to watch TV in his room, had some drinks, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next day. The girlfriend is upset not just because of the sleepover but also because of other instances where the friend crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival while the girlfriend was nearby. The author mentions that they had joked about threesomes, and he had mentioned the friend, which might have contributed to the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust and communication in a relationship. The girlfriend felt insecure and noticed behaviors that the author didn't realize were making her uncomfortable. The author didn't ask his girlfriend before the sleepover, which could be a breach of trust. Even if the sleepover was innocent, not informing the girlfriend about plans involving another person, especially a close friend, might be seen as disregard for her feelings. Additionally, the previous jokes about threesomes could have planted seeds of insecurity, making the girlfriend view the situation as more significant than it was.\n\nHowever, the author didn't intentionally do anything to harm the relationship. He didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't have any intention to cross boundaries. The issue seems to stem from a lack of communication and the girlfriend's past concerns being valid. The author's friend's actions (like holding hands) might have been innocent, but from the girlfriend's perspective, they could be perceived as flirtatious. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate their boundaries and comfort levels. The author might not have realized how his actions affected his girlfriend, but the fact that he didn't consider her feelings beforehand is a point against him. He should have discussed the plans with her, especially given their previous conversations about threesomes. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be seen as overreacting if the author had no malicious intent, but her feelings are valid because trust is crucial in a relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not checking in with his girlfriend before the sleepover and not being aware of how his actions made her feel. Even if the actions were innocent, the lack of communication and consideration for her feelings could be seen as a mistake. However, the girlfriend's reaction might also be influenced by past insecurities, so it's a nuanced situation. The key is that the author didn't act with malice, but his failure to communicate led to a breach of trust. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but not entirely. However, based on the options given, the answer would be A (Yes) because the author's actions, though not malicious, contributed to the girlfriend's discomfort through lack of communication and awareness.\n"
