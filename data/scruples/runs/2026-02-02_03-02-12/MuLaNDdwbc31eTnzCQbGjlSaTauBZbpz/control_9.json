Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for heckling cat-caller. They do this by making a loud \"booo!\" sound, like at a movie villain. The main question is whether their actions are justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so stopping it is generally seen as a good thing. But the method here is public heckling, which might have unintended consequences. The user mentions that other people think they're an asshole, with both men and women criticizing them. Men think it's getting them into trouble, women think it draws attention and makes the situation worse.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong (A): Their method might escalate the situation. By loudly reacting, they could be making the victims uncomfortable or even more of a target. The cat-caller might feel provoked and act out more. Also, the author is using a confrontational approach that could be seen as aggressive, even if the intent is good. Drawing attention might not be helpful for the person being harassed, as they might not want to be noticed. Plus, the author is getting threats, which shows that their approach is causing conflict.\n\nArguments for not being in the wrong (B): The author's goal is to stop harassment, which is a positive intention. They're trying to create a culture where others also speak up. Their method might shame the cat-callers into stopping. Since no one has physically attacked them yet, it might not be causing real harm. They believe their actions are effective in discouraging bad behavior.\n\nBut then, even with good intentions, if the method is causing more problems (like drawing attention to the victim or escalating the situation), then maybe it's not the best approach. Also, the reactions from others suggest that their method isn't seen as helpful. It's possible that a different approach, like reporting or non-confrontational methods, would be better. The line between standing up for someone and causing more issues can be thin. So, even if the intent is good, the execution might be problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to use public shaming? It depends on cultural context. In some places, direct confrontation is accepted, but in others, it might not be. Also, considering power dynamics: the author is a big person, so maybe they feel safe to do this. But others might not be able to. The effectiveness is questionable. If the cat-caller is just cussing back, maybe it's not stopping the harassment. The author's approach might not be the best solution.\n\nSo, balancing all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their method could be counterproductive. Even if the intent is good, the outcome might make things worse for the person being harassed. The best approach might be to address it in a way that doesn't draw attention to the victim and doesn't escalate conflict. So, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
