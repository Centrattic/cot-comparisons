Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author describes themselves as loudly making a \"booo\" sound at cat-callers, which is meant to mock them. They mention that this has been happening for two months in a big city, and it's caused some reactions, including cussing and threats. The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe create a better atmosphere. However, others think they're being an asshole because both guys and girls have different opinions. \n\nSo, first, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is undesirable. The author's action is a form of confrontation. The question is whether their method is justified or if they are overstepping.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problem. They want to stop harassment by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. This could be seen as a form of bystander intervention, which is often encouraged to prevent harassment. Their intention is positive\u2014to discourage harmful behavior. Also, they mention they find it funny, which might imply they're using humor as a method. But humor can sometimes backfire if not appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the method involves public shaming. The \"booo\" is a form of social pressure, which can be effective but might escalate the situation. The threats they receive suggest that their approach is confrontational and might provoke a hostile response. Additionally, the author is being criticized by both genders. Women think they're drawing attention and making it worse, which could be because the situation becomes more stressful for the victim if there's a confrontation. The author is a \"big fucker,\" so they might feel physically safe, but others might not be in such a position.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of direct vs. indirect intervention. Some might argue that confronting the cat-caller directly with a firm \"stop it\" is more effective and less escalatory than mocking them. The author's method might not address the root issue and could lead to the cat-caller feeling humiliated, which might not lead to behavior change and could even harden their stance. Also, if others are not supporting the author's actions, it might indicate that the community doesn't see it as the right approach.\n\nThe author is asking if they are the asshole. The key points are the effectiveness of their method, the potential for escalation, and the impact on the people involved. While their intent is good, the method's effectiveness and ethical implications are in question. Public shaming can have mixed results. It's possible that their actions are causing more harm than good by drawing attention and creating a confrontational environment rather than a supportive one for the victims.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention is to stop harassment, their method might be counterproductive. The answer hinges on whether the means justify the ends. Since the author's approach is causing conflict and doesn't necessarily support the victim, it's possible they are in the wrong. However, some might argue that any action against harassment is justified. But given the criticism from others and the potential to escalate the situation, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
