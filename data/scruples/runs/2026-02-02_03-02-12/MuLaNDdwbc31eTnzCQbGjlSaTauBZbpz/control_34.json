Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers, which is causing some backlash but they think it might discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The author's actions are confrontational but not violent. They're trying to stop harassment, which is a valid concern. But they're using public humiliation as a method. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment that can make women feel unsafe. By interrupting it, the author might be helping the victims. But the author is also making a scene, which could escalate the situation. The author mentions that people think they're an asshole, with some thinking it draws more attention. However, the author's intent is good\u2014they want to discourage the behavior.\n\nBut wait, is it the author's place to do this? Maybe they should instead report to authorities or support the victims in a less confrontational way. However, the author is using their own power to stop the harassment directly. The line between standing up for someone and inserting oneself into someone else's problem can be blurry.\n\nAlso, the author is big, so they might not fear retaliation, but others might not be in that position. Their approach could be seen as overstepping if they're not asked by the victim to intervene. But if the victim is just a bystander, maybe direct confrontation isn't the best approach.\n\nDifferent perspectives: some see it as a white knight act, others as making it worse. The author's method might not be the best, but does that mean they're in the wrong? If the intent is good and the action doesn't involve violence, perhaps they aren't in the wrong, even if their method is debatable. Alternatively, maybe they should avoid making it about themselves and instead find a more subtle way to support the victim.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method might be questionable, the intent is to stop harassment, which is positive. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
