Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author started doing this two months ago in a big city. They use a loud \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which sometimes leads to cussing and threats but no actual physical confrontations. People around think they're an asshole\u2014both guys and girls have different opinions. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe create a better atmosphere. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, so intervening might be seen as positive. But the method here is public heckling, which could escalate the situation. The author is using mockery, which might not be the best approach. The response from others is negative, with some thinking it's making things worse by drawing attention. Also, the author is big and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but threats are there.\n\nOn one hand, standing up against harassment is good. On the other, the method might not be effective or safe. The author's approach could be seen as confrontational rather than de-escalating. The girls' perspective that it draws attention and makes the situation worse is a valid concern. Maybe there are better ways to intervene, like reporting or supporting the victim without direct confrontation. The author might be well-intentioned but the execution could be problematic. So, considering all that, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because their method could be counterproductive and potentially harmful, even if the intent is good.\n"
