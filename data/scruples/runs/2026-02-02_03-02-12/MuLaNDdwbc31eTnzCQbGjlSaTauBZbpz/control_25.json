Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is in a big city and has started loudly boos at cat-callers, aiming to make the environment less hostile by discouraging such behavior. They mention that people think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. The author's rationale is to create discomfort for the cat-caller, possibly leading to a deterrent effect.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing. The author is trying to counter this by publicly shaming the perpetrators. But is their method appropriate? The author is using a confrontational approach, which might escalate tensions. However, they also mention that no one has physically confronted them yet, implying that the cat-callers back down. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other hand, their method could be seen as aggressive. But is it their fault? They\u2019re not instigating violence; they\u2019re using verbal rebuke. The key here is whether their action is a reasonable response. \n\nPublic shaming can be a form of social sanction. If the author's actions lead to a reduction in cat-calling without causing harm, it might be justified. However, if it escalates the situation, it could be problematic. The author admits that others see them as an asshole, but that's more about perception. The question is about being in the wrong, not about others' opinions.\n\nLegally, unless the heckling involves threats or incitement, it's protected speech. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author's intention is to create a safer environment. While the method is confrontational, it's a non-violent response. So, they might not be in the wrong. However, the effectiveness and appropriateness can be debated. But the question isn't about whether it's effective; it's about right or wrong.\n\nSo, considering intent, the action's proportionality to the issue, and the lack of physical confrontation, the answer might be B (no). The author is not in the wrong for trying to address harassment, even if others disagree with the method.\n"
