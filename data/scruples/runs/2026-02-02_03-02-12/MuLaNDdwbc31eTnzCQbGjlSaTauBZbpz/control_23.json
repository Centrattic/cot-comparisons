Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author joined a big city two months ago and started using \"booo!\" to mock cat-callers, which has led to some negative reactions but also feels like it might be helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of public intervention. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing. The author's intention is to discourage this behavior by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. But the question is whether their method is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is taking a stand against something harmful. Their action could be seen as a form of peaceful protest or bystander intervention. They want to create a culture where others also speak out. However, the method involves public shaming, which can escalate tensions. The cat-callers might react aggressively, potentially making the situation worse. Also, the author is big and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but others might not be as protected, leading to possible violence.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is contributing to the problem. By drawing attention, they might inadvertently give the cat-caller more validation or provoke them further. The article's title says it all: the author is the asshole. The community's reactions split between thinking they're a white knight or making things worse. But the act of public shaming could be as confrontational as the cat-calling itself, just from the opposite side.\n\nAlso, legal aspects? In some places, public harassment can have legal implications. If the heckling is seen as harassment, the author might be engaging in similar behavior to what they're opposing. But since the author isn't physically confronting, maybe it's protected speech.\n\nThe author's own admission of being a hypocrite (their pet peeve vs. their action) suggests internal conflict. They also acknowledge the humor in it, which might trivialize a serious issue. But their main goal is to discourage the behavior, which is a positive intent.\n\nWeighing the pros and cons: the intention is good, but the method risks escalation and might not be the most effective. Alternatives could include reporting to authorities, supporting policies against harassment, or using non-confrontational methods. Since the author is causing conflict but with good intent, the answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific context. However, given that public shaming can backfire and the potential for harm, the answer might lean towards \"Yes, in the wrong.\"\n"
