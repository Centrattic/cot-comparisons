Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making a loud \"booo!\" sound. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to deter catcalling by making the perpetrators uncomfortable. They mention that their action is similar to booing a villain in a movie, which is a form of public disapproval. The author acknowledges that both men and women have different opinions on whether they're being a white knight or causing more attention. The author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others might also speak up against the behavior.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Catcalling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the catcallers. Public shaming can be a gray area\u2014it can sometimes escalate situations, but in this case, the author claims they haven't faced any physical confrontation yet.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument: by drawing attention, maybe they're making it worse for the person being catcalled. The author admits that some women think it's making the situation worse. But the alternative is allowing the harassment to continue without intervention. The author's method is non-violent and aims to discourage the behavior without physical retaliation.\n\nAnother angle: the right to free speech versus public order. The author is expressing disapproval, which is a form of free speech. But if their actions are causing a disturbance, there might be a conflict. However, since they're not using threats or violence, it's more about public expression.\n\nAlso, the author is aware of the potential backlash and is reflecting on their actions, which shows they're considering the consequences. They're open to stopping if they're wrong, which is a responsible approach.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are intended to reduce harassment, though the effectiveness is debatable. The key point is whether their method is appropriate. Since they're not engaging in violence or threats, and their goal aligns with reducing unwanted behavior, it's a form of peaceful protest. However, the debate lies in whether public shaming is the right approach. But given the options, the author isn't in the wrong for trying a non-violent method to address a problem they care about.\n"
