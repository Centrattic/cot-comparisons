Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a big city and has a habit of \"booo!\"-ing cat-callers, like a silent movie villain. They mention that this leads to some angry responses but no actual harm yet. Their rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere where others might speak up. They also admit they find it funny but are open to the possibility they're an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and the author is trying to stop it. Public shaming or immediate intervention can sometimes deter such behavior. The author isn't physically confronting the cat-callers, just verbally expressing disapproval. That could be seen as a positive action, standing up against harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that publicly humiliating the cat-caller could escalate the situation. The author mentions that it leads to threats, so there's a risk of confrontation. Also, some people (like the girls mentioned) think it draws more attention and might make the situation worse. The author is using a confrontational method, which could be seen as aggressive or disruptive. \n\nBut then again, the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't physically harming anyone, just expressing disapproval in a public setting. The intent is to discourage harassment, which is a valid goal. While the method might be debated, the intent seems positive. \n\nHowever, the key here is whether the author's actions are considered wrong. The author is taking a stand against harassment, which is widely seen as negative. Even if the method is questionable, the underlying action is supporting a positive cause. The response from others (guys calling them a white knight, girls thinking it's making it worse) shows divided opinions, but the author's actions are aimed at stopping something harmful. \n\nIn such cases, the general consensus often leans towards supporting interventions against harassment, even if the method isn't perfect. So the author's actions, while maybe not the most effective or considerate, are likely not in the wrong. The answer would be B, not in the wrong."
