Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's reasoning is that they want to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They mention that their actions sometimes lead to cussing and threats, but they haven't faced physical consequences yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and can make others feel harassed. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But is public shaming a valid or ethical response? On one hand, standing up against harassment is commendable. On the other hand, the author is using a confrontational method that might escalate the situation.\n\nThe author's justification is about creating a deterrent effect. However, by loudly heckling, they might be adding to the confrontation. Some people might argue that this isn't helping the person being harassed, who might feel more embarrassed or targeted if others are involved. The author's peers are divided: some see them as a white knight, others think they're making things worse. \n\nAlso, the author is using humor or mockery, which could be seen as disrespectful. The line between standing up against harassment and becoming part of the problem can be thin. If the heckling leads to a more hostile environment without effectively stopping the cat-caller, it might not be helpful. Plus, there's the risk of escalating to violence, even if it hasn't happened yet.\n\nBut then, the author's intention is good\u2014they want to reduce harassment. Maybe there are more effective ways to address it, like reporting to authorities or using non-confrontational methods. However, the question is about right or wrong, not effectiveness. Legally, unless the heckling involves threats or is part of the harassment, it might be protected speech. Ethically, though, it's a grey area. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author's actions are a form of intervention, but the method might be problematic. It's possible they are overstepping by inserting themselves into a situation that might not be their role to handle. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the answer is A (yes), it's because their approach could be harmful. If B (no), it's because they're trying to combat harassment. But given the potential to escalate and the mixed opinions, maybe A is the better answer here.\n"
