Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is actively calling out cat-callers by making loud noises, which is leading to some negative reactions. The question is whether their actions are justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment and unpleasant for the victims. The author's intention is to discourage this behavior by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. On the surface, that seems like a positive intent. However, the method involves public confrontation, which could escalate the situation.\n\nNow, the responses from others: some guys think he's a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble, implying that his approach might be too confrontational. Women think he's making the situation worse by drawing attention. There's a valid point here that public heckling might not be the best way to address harassment. It could potentially escalate tensions, making the environment more hostile rather than safer. Also, if someone is being threatened or cursed at, the heckler might be putting themselves in a dangerous situation, even if they feel physically capable.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. The author believes that by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, they'll stop. But does this method actually work? Studies or experiences might suggest that direct confrontation could sometimes lead to the harasser becoming more aggressive. Alternatively, bystander intervention techniques often recommend strategies that de-escalate rather than escalate, like calmly confronting the person or reporting to authorities.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they find it funny. That could be a problem if the motivation isn't just about stopping harassment but also personal amusement. It's important that the action is genuinely aimed at stopping harassment, not for the thrill or attention.\n\nLegal considerations: In some places, there might be specific laws about public disturbances. If the heckling is loud and disruptive, it could lead to legal issues. However, since the author hasn't faced any legal consequences yet, maybe it's not a major point here.\n\nThe author's approach might not be inclusive. For example, if someone is being cat-called, they might want the situation to be ignored to avoid confrontation. The author's action could inadvertently take away the victim's choice to handle it their way. Plus, not all victims might appreciate a third party making a scene, as it could draw more attention to them.\n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the author is overstepping. While the intent is good, the method might not be the most appropriate. Encouraging others to tell the cat-caller off could be more effective if done in a calm, non-confrontational way. Public heckling might come off as aggressive and not model the desired behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention is to stop harassment, the method used could be counterproductive. It might escalate the situation, make the victims uncomfortable, and not effectively deter the behavior. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using a confrontational approach that could cause more harm than good.\n"
