Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who writes about heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The question is between A (yes, they are wrong) or B (no, they aren't). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started loudly booing cat-callers. They mention that this is a response to their pet peeve and they want to discourage the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the cat-caller. They get negative reactions from both sides\u2014some people think they're a white knight, others think they're making it worse. The author is questioning if they're an asshole for doing this.\n\nSo, the main points here are: is it acceptable to confront cat-callers in a public manner that might escalate the situation? The author's intention is good\u2014stopping harassment. But their method involves public shaming, which can have unintended consequences. \n\nCat-calling is indeed a form of harassment, and bystander intervention can sometimes help. However, the way the author is doing it\u2014loudly booing\u2014might not be the most effective approach. It's possible that it draws more attention to the victim, making the situation worse. Also, the author admits that people around them think they're an asshole, which suggests mixed reactions.\n\nI should consider the possible outcomes. The author's method might lead to conflict, as they've received threats. Also, while the intention is to discourage harassment, public shaming can sometimes be just as aggressive. The article mentions that women think they're making it worse, which is a valid concern because the victim might not want the situation escalated. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions are aimed at stopping harassment, which is a positive intent. But the method could be counterproductive. There's a balance between standing up against harassment and creating a more hostile environment. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified as a form of intervention. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that it's good to challenge harassment, but others might say that it's not the bystander's place to act in a way that could make the victim uncomfortable. The effectiveness of the method is also in question. Does public booing actually discourage the behavior, or does it just cause more tension?\n\nAnother angle is the author's admission of hypocrisy (the asterisk note), which might indicate self-awareness. They are open to the idea that they could be wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the method used is causing more harm than good, even with good intentions, then maybe yes. But if it's seen as a valid form of protest, then no. The question is about being in the wrong, which is a moral or social judgment. \n\nIn many cases, direct confrontation can be problematic. Encouraging others to intervene is better, but the author is doing it themselves. The answer might lean towards A because the method could be seen as inappropriate, even if the intention is good. However, some might argue B because the action is against harassment. \n\nBut the consensus in the scenario is that others think the author is an asshole, and the potential for escalation exists. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their approach isn't the best way to address the issue. So, Answer A.\n"
