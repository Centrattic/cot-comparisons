Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to stop catcalling by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. They use a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which sometimes leads to curses or threats. They acknowledge that others see them as an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. Their rationale is to discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere, though they also admit they find it funny.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to address a problem. However, their method is public shaming or heckling. While their intent is good, the method might be problematic. Public shaming can escalate tensions, potentially leading to confrontations. Even though no physical altercations have occurred, the threats suggest it could happen. Also, the author admits to possibly being a hypocrite, which adds complexity.\n\nOn one hand, intervening in harassment is commendable. On the other, the approach might not be effective and could make situations worse. The author's own admission that others think they're an asshole and that it might draw unwanted attention supports the idea that their method isn't universally accepted as appropriate. Plus, the line between standing up against harassment and becoming a provocateur is thin here. The humor they find in the situation might trivialize the seriousness of the issue they're addressing.\n\nSo, while the intent is good, the method could be seen as counterproductive or aggressive. The answer likely leans towards A (they're in the wrong) because their approach may escalate conflict rather than resolve it, and they might not be considering the broader impact of their actions beyond their immediate intent.\n"
