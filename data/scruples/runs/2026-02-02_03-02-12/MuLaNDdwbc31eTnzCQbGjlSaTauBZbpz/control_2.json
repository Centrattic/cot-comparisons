Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're loudly heckling cat-callers by making a \"booo!\" sound at them, and getting some angry responses. They want to know if they're an asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author moved to a big city two months ago and noticed that cat-calling is a problem. They're trying to address it by making a public show of disapproving, which they admit can be seen as hypocritical since they're also interrupting the moment. \n\nNow, cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so the intention here is to stop that behavior. The author's method is to confront the cat-callers in a public way, hoping to discourage them. They acknowledge that people on both sides (men and women) think they're being an asshole. Men think they're overstepping and risking a confrontation, while women believe they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to prevent harassment, which is a valid concern. They might be helping to create a culture where such behavior is not tolerated. On the other hand, their method involves public shaming, which could escalate the situation. The author mentions that people curse back and threaten them, which could lead to more conflict. Also, by drawing attention, they might inadvertently focus more on the cat-caller, which some argue could make the victim uncomfortable or embarrassed. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of their method. If the goal is to stop harassment, does publicly shaming the cat-caller work? Some studies suggest that public shaming can be effective in changing behavior, but it can also lead to backlash. The author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage them. However, there's also a risk that the cat-caller might become more aggressive or retaliate against the author or the victim.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they're physically imposing, which might deter potential physical confrontation. But even so, the act of heckling could be seen as aggressive and possibly contributing to a hostile environment. The key here is whether the author's actions are an appropriate response. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, is it the author's place to intervene in this way? Some might argue that it's better to support victims by creating a safe environment, but direct intervention can be seen as taking matters into one's own hands. There's also the question of consent; the author is intervening without the victim's permission, which might not be considered respectful by all.\n\nConsidering all these factors, there's a balance between addressing harassment and the method used. The author's intention is positive, but the method could be problematic. Public shaming might not be the most effective or respectful way to handle the issue. It's possible that the author is overstepping, even if their intentions are good. Therefore, the answer could lean towards them being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
