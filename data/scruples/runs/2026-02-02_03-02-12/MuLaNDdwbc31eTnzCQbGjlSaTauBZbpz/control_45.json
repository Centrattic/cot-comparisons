Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they've been loudly heckling cat-callers by making a \"*booo!*\" sound like in a silent movie. They admit some people think they're an asshole, with different opinions from guys and girls. The author's reasoning is that they want to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe create a culture where others tell the cat-caller off. They also find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's right or wrong. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address this, but their method might be problematic. The question is whether their response is reasonable or if they're overreacting.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. Their action might shame the cat-caller, possibly deterring them. However, heckling with a \"*booo*\" could be seen as mocking or drawing more attention to the situation. The cat-caller might feel humiliated, which could escalate things. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, so maybe their approach is confrontational and not effective in the long run.\n\nThe other side is that public shaming can have negative consequences. It might not address the root issue and could make the cat-caller more confrontational. Also, by loudly reacting, the author might be making the situation more noticeable, which could be uncomfortable for others around. The girls think it's making things worse by drawing attention. If the goal is to stop harassment, maybe a different approach, like directly telling the person to stop or supporting the victim more discreetly, would be better.\n\nThe author's size and confidence might protect them from physical harm, but others might not be so lucky. Relying on personal intimidation isn't a sustainable solution. Also, the humor aspect might not align with the seriousness of the issue. While the intent is good, the method could be counterproductive.\n\nSo, balancing intent (trying to stop harassment) with the method (publicly shaming with heckling). It's a tricky area. Some might argue that any action against harassment is good, but others say it's not the right approach. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong. If the method is causing more harm than good or is seen as inappropriate, then maybe they are in the wrong. However, if the intent is positive even if the method is questionable, it's a gray area. Ultimately, it might depend on whether their actions are effective and respectful. Since the author is causing confrontation and possibly making the situation worse for others, they could be in the wrong.\n"
