Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that they're loudly booing cat-callers, which is their way of trying to stop the behavior. They mention getting cussed out and threats, but no actual harm. The question is whether they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, cat-calling is generally seen as harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to stand up against that, which could be seen as a positive action. Their intention is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. That might be justified in the sense of challenging harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that the author's method of loudly booing could escalate the situation. The author mentions that others think they're making things worse by drawing attention. Also, the fact that they find it funny might come off as mocking the situation or not taking it seriously. The question is whether their actions cross a line into being confrontational or provocative, which could lead to more conflict rather than solving the problem.\n\nThe author is in a big city, where such incidents might be more common. Their rationale is to create an atmosphere where people discourage each other from cat-calling. However, using public heckling might not be the most effective method. It's possible that the cat-callers are already aware of their behavior being inappropriate, and the author's reaction could make them more defensive or aggressive.\n\nAlso, the author's size might play a role in why they haven't been physically confronted, but that doesn't mean their actions are right. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified as a form of intervention. Some might argue that it's a form of civic duty to stand against harassment, while others might say it's not their place to intervene in that way.\n\nI should also consider the potential consequences. If the author's actions lead to more hostility or escalate situations, that could be problematic. However, if it's preventing harassment and making the environment less welcoming for cat-calling, it could be seen as a positive. The author's own perspective is that they're trying to be the change, but others see them as an asshole. The dilemma here is balancing intervention with causing more harm.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, public shaming or confrontation can be a gray area. While the intent is good, the method might not be the most constructive. The author might benefit from other methods like reporting the behavior to authorities or supporting policies that address harassment rather than direct confrontation.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether the author's approach is considered effective and appropriate. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, and considering that their actions aim to stop harassment, but their method might have negative side effects, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, since they're trying to address a harmful behavior, even if their method is questionable, it's possible they aren't in the wrong. But if their actions are counterproductive, they might be. The answer could go either way, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent is to stop harassment, even if the method isn't perfect.\n"
