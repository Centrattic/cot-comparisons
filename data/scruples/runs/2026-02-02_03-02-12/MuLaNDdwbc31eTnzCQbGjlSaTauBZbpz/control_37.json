Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who's heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The author is doing this to confront people who catcall others, which they find objectionable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, catcalling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The author's intention is to stop this behavior by making it uncomfortable for the culprits. They mention that they're not getting into physical fights but are using verbal heckling. \n\nBut then, the method is loud and confrontational. The author gets curses and threats in return, and others think they're being an asshole. Some might argue that direct confrontation could escalate the situation, even if the intent is good. The author's approach might draw attention, which could make the victims more uncomfortable or put them in a worse position. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of personal responsibility. The author claims they're trying to create a better environment by discouraging others from catcalling. However, the effectiveness of this method is debatable. If the author's actions lead to more conflict or don't actually stop the behavior, it might not be the best approach. \n\nAnother angle is that the author might be overstepping. While they're objecting to harassment, their method could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. It's possible that the catcallers are unaware their actions are harmful, but the author's public shaming could be counterproductive. \n\nOn the other side, some might support the author's actions as a form of standing up against harassment. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If their actions cause more harm than good, even with good intentions, they might be at fault. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward, but the consensus in the question's context (AITA) often leans towards whether the action is socially acceptable. Since people around think the author is an asshole and there's a risk of making the situation worse, even if the intent is good, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong). However, there's also a strong case for B (Not in the wrong) because they're addressing a problem. But the consensus in similar situations usually emphasizes de-escalation and not drawing attention, so the answer is likely A.\n"
