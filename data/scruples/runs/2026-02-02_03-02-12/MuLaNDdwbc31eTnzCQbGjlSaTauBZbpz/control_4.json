Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author has been loudly heckling catcallers by \"booo!\"ing them like a silent movie villain. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. The motivation is to make the catcallers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, and maybe create an atmosphere where others tell the catcallers to stop. However, both men and women think the author is an asshole. Men say they're a white knight asking for trouble, and women think they're drawing attention and making things worse. The author acknowledges they might be an asshole and are asking for validation.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about addressing catcalling. Catcalling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author's approach is direct confrontation by publicly shaming the catcallers. But the question is whether this makes the author the asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop a behavior that's harmful and unwanted. Their intention is to discourage it by making the catcallers uncomfortable. That seems like a good intention. But on the other hand, their method could escalate the situation. By heckling loudly, they might be drawing more attention, which could make the victims (women) feel more uncomfortable or targeted. Also, the catcallers might react aggressively, which could put the author at risk or escalate the conflict.\n\nThe author mentions that people think they're an asshole. Women think they're making the situation worse. It's possible that the author's approach isn't effective and might even be counterproductive. For example, if the catcaller is being mocked, they might double down or retaliate. Plus, the author's method isn't addressing the root issue but rather just reacting publicly, which could come off as performative or confrontational.\n\nAnother angle is the use of public shaming. While it might seem like a way to call out bad behavior, it can sometimes be seen as vigilantism. The author is taking it upon themselves to enforce social norms, which might not be the best approach. Also, the author's own safety is a consideration\u2014they might be provoking potentially dangerous situations by engaging in this way.\n\nBut then again, the alternative is that the author is trying to create a safer environment for others. If the catcalling is a problem in their area, someone has to step in. However, the method might not be the most effective. A better approach might be to support the person being catcalled discreetly or to address the behavior in a non-confrontational way. The author's approach, while well-intentioned, might not be the most effective or considerate.\n\nAlso, the author is getting cussed at and threats, but they feel they can handle it. However, their actions might not be helping the person being catcalled. If the target of the catcalling is uncomfortable with the author's intervention, that could be problematic. The author doesn't mention asking the person if they want help, which could be a key missing element.\n\nIn summary, the author's intentions are good, but their method might be flawed. Publicly heckling could be seen as creating more conflict rather than solving the issue. It's possible that the author is overstepping and not considering the perspective of those being catcalled. So, while the intent is positive, the execution might make them the asshole. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
