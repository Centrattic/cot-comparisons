Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author says they do this by making a loud \"booo!\" sound when they see cat-calling. They mention that people around them think they're an asshole, with both men and women criticizing them. The author's rationale is that they want to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and unwanted. The author is trying to address it by publicly shaming the cat-caller. But the question is whether their method is justified. \n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment, so trying to stop it could be seen as positive. Public shaming might deter the behavior. On the other hand, if the response escalates the situation or draws more attention, it could potentially make things worse. The author mentions that the cat-callers respond with cussing and threats, but the author is physically strong and hasn't faced actual harm yet. \n\nThe author also acknowledges that others think they're an asshole. Some people might think that intervening in such a way could be counterproductive, as it might make the victims feel more self-conscious or embarrassed. However, the author's intention is to support the victims and discourage harassment. \n\nI should consider different perspectives. Legal aspects? Probably not an issue unless there's a physical confrontation. Ethically, it's about the right to protest harassment versus the methods used. The author isn't causing physical harm, just verbal. But public shaming can be seen as a form of confrontation. \n\nAnother angle: bystander intervention. Encouraging others to step in is a good idea. But the method here is public humiliation. Is that acceptable? Some might say yes, as it's a non-violent way to address the problem. Others might argue that it's not the bystander's role to act in that way, and that it could lead to more conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are positive, but the method might be questionable. However, since cat-calling is a harmful behavior, and the author is trying to stop it without violence, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a middle ground where they could be more supportive to the victims without escalating. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, and given their non-violent approach, probably not.\n"
