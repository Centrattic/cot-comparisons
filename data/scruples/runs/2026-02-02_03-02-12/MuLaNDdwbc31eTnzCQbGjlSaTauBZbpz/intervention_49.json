Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author's actions involve making a loud \"booo\" sound at people who are cat-calling, which is a form of public shaming. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. The rationale is that by making the cat-callers uncomfortable, they might discourage the behavior and create a more supportive atmosphere.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of public shaming. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and disrespectful, so the author has a valid grievance. However, responding with public mockery could escalate the situation. The author mentions that they get cussed at and sometimes threatened, but no physical harm yet. \n\nThe author's defense is about being a deterrent, but is that justification enough? Public shaming can sometimes be seen as vigilantism. While the intent is good\u2014trying to stop harassment\u2014the method might not be the best approach. It's possible that drawing attention to the situation could make it worse, as others might get involved or the situation could become more confrontational. \n\nThe author also mentions that both men and women think they're being an asshole. Men think they're being a \"white knight\" who's asking for trouble, and women think they're making things worse by drawing attention. There's a risk that the heckling could escalate the problem rather than solve it. \n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of the approach. Does public shaming actually reduce cat-calling, or does it just create a different kind of conflict? Maybe there are better ways to address cat-calling, like reporting to authorities or using bystander intervention techniques that don't involve confrontation. \n\nThe author also admits to finding it funny, which might be a bit self-serving. While the main goal is to stop harassment, the enjoyment aspect could be seen as hypocritical or not serious enough. \n\nIn terms of personal responsibility, the author is trying to take action against something they find wrong. That's commendable, but the method needs to be appropriate. If the heckling leads to more conflict, it could be counterproductive. \n\nLegal considerations: In some places, heckling might be protected under free speech, but if it incites violence or leads to public disorder, there could be legal repercussions. The author hasn't faced consequences yet, but that doesn't mean there aren't any. \n\nSo, balancing the good intention with the potential negative outcomes. The author isn't wrong entirely because cat-calling is a real issue, but their method might be problematic. It's a gray area. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer could hinge on whether the ends justify the means. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to combat harassment, the approach of public shaming might not be the most effective or appropriate. Therefore, they could be considered in the wrong for not considering alternative methods that don't escalate the situation.\n"
