Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. They provided their own thoughts, thinking the author isn't wrong, but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers in a big city. Their goal is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and promote a culture where others also call out such behavior. They've received reactions from both sides\u2014some guys think they're a \"white knight cruising for a bruising,\" while women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author acknowledges some hypocrisy in being a pet peeve about cat-calling but engaging in it themselves through heckling. They also admit to finding it funny, which might be a complicating factor.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unwanted. The author is trying to address this by interrupting the act publicly. The question is whether their method is appropriate. \n\nOn one hand, interrupting harassment can be seen as a form of intervention, which is positive. It might help the person being harassed by showing support and deterring the cat-caller. Public shaming, however, can have mixed results. It might escalate the situation, making the victim feel more exposed. Also, if the heckling leads to confrontations, it could put the author at risk, but they mention being a \"fairly big fucker\" and no one has acted on threats yet. \n\nThe author's rationale is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. That's a good intention. But the effectiveness of public heckling is debatable. Does it really stop the behavior, or just create a spectacle? Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might imply a lack of seriousness about the issue, even if their intentions are good. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for drawing more attention to the situation. While the author wants to create an atmosphere where others join in, it might instead make the person being cat-called feel like the situation is now a public spectacle, which could be uncomfortable or stressful for them. \n\nLegally, unless the heckling involves threats or incitement, it's likely protected speech. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally. \n\nThe responses from others are mixed. Some see the author as a well-meaning but naive person, others as exacerbating the problem. The key here is whether the method of intervention is appropriate. \n\nIf the author's action is non-confrontational and doesn't escalate the situation beyond verbal heckling, it might be justified. But if it leads to threats or a hostile environment, that's a problem. The author claims no one has followed through on threats, so maybe it's not causing physical harm yet. \n\nThe hypocrisy angle is mentioned by the author themselves. They dislike cat-calling but engage in a form of public shaming, which could be seen as similar behavior. However, the intent here is to stop harassment, not to harass. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a form of direct intervention aimed at stopping harassment. While their intentions are good, the method could have unintended consequences. The question is whether the ends justify the means. If the heckling effectively deters future harassment without causing more harm, it's a positive action. If it makes the situation worse for the victim or leads to violence, it's problematic. The author hasn't caused physical harm yet, but the social backlash is present. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is trying to do the right thing but might be using a method that isn't the most effective or considerate. However, since their intent is to stop harassment and they aren't causing direct harm, they might not be in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the method's drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\n"
