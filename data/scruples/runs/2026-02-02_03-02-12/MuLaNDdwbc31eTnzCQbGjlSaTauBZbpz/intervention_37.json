Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making \"booo!\" sounds at them. The author's rationale is to discourage the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers. Others around them have given mixed reactions: guys think it's white knight behavior, and girls think it's making things worse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and unwelcome. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the offenders. But public shaming can be a tricky approach. While the intent is good\u2014trying to stop harassment\u2014the method might have unintended consequences. \n\nIf the author's actions are causing the cat-callers to become hostile or escalate the situation, that's a problem. The author mentions that the cat-callers respond with curses and threats, but the author is physically capable and hasn't faced actual harm. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just if it's effective.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for drawing attention. The author is loud and disruptive, which might make the situation worse for the victims. The girls' opinion is that it's making things worse, which is a valid concern. If the heckling causes more attention, the victims might feel even more uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nAlso, the method of \"white knight\" behavior\u2014intervening in a way that might not be welcomed by the person being harassed\u2014could be problematic. The person being cat-called might prefer privacy and not want public confrontation. The author's intervention might not be their desired response, thus adding another layer of discomfort.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is trying to create a culture where others also speak up against harassment. If the author's actions lead others to do the same, maybe it's positive. However, the effectiveness here is questionable, and the potential for harm is there.\n\nSo, weighing the intent (good) against the method (public shaming that could escalate conflict and potentially distress victims), it's possible that the author is in the wrong. The intervention might not be the best approach, even if the intent is good. The right approach might involve more direct support to the victim or reporting the behavior rather than public confrontation. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
