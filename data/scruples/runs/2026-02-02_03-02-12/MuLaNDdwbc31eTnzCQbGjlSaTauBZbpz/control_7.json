Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds at them. The author's reasoning is that they want to discourage the behavior by making the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly foster a culture where others tell the cat-callers to stop. However, others think the author is an asshole, with some thinking they're being a white knight and others saying they're making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author is trying to address this, which is a positive intent. However, their method is public heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The question is whether this method is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is taking a stand against harassment, which is commendable. They are trying to deter the behavior, which aligns with promoting a safer environment. Their action might also serve as a form of social accountability, which can be effective.\n\nOn the other hand, the method involves direct confrontation in a public setting. This could escalate the situation. The author mentions getting curses and threats, which shows that the cat-callers react negatively. By drawing attention, the author might inadvertently make the target feel more targeted, which could be counterproductive. Also, some people might argue that the author's approach is aggressive, which could lead to more conflict rather than resolution.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does heckling actually discourage cat-calling? If it works, then maybe it's justified. However, if it makes the situation worse by turning the attention back onto the victim (the person being cat-called), that's a concern. The author's intention is to help, but the impact might not align with the intention.\n\nAdditionally, there's the aspect of personal safety. The author mentions being a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they can handle physical confrontations, but others might not be in that position. Public heckling could set a precedent that might be unsafe for others to follow.\n\nLegal perspectives? In some places, cat-calling is protected under free speech unless it's targeted harassment. The author's response is also a form of public expression. However, depending on local laws, there might be nuances. But generally, both parties are within their rights to express themselves unless there's a threat of violence.\n\nSocial norms vary. In some communities, public shaming is seen as a way to enforce norms, while in others, it's considered bullying. The author's approach might be seen as a form of vigilantism, which can be controversial.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's method is the appropriate way to address the issue. While the intent is good, the method could have negative side effects. The author might be crossing a line by using confrontation that could escalate the situation rather than de-escalate it. The fact that others think they're an asshole might indicate that their method isn't well-received, even if the goal is to stop harassment.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that standing up against harassment is important, and the author is taking a proactive stance. The key here is whether the means justify the ends. If the author's actions are effective in reducing harassment without causing more harm, then it's a valid approach. But if it's making the situation worse, then it's problematic.\n\nGiven the mixed reactions from others and the potential for escalation, the author might be in the wrong because their method isn't universally supportive and could be counterproductive. However, if the community or context supports such actions, then maybe not. Since the scenario is in a big city where such dynamics are complex, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but it's a nuanced issue.\n"
