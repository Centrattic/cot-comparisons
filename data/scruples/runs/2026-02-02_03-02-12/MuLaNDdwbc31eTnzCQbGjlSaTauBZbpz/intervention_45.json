Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author's main argument is that they're trying to discourage catcalling by making it uncomfortable for the offenders. They mention that they've been doing this for two months in a big city, and while people have mixed reactions, their rationale is about creating a better atmosphere.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally seen as harassment, so intervening might be seen as standing up against harassment. However, the method used is loud heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The author uses a \"booo\" like in a silent movie, which is a form of public shaming. \n\nPublic shaming can be a gray area. On one hand, it might deter the behavior by making the offender feel socially unacceptable. On the other hand, it could escalate tensions, leading to physical confrontations. The author mentions that people think they're an asshole, with some believing it could make the situation worse by drawing attention. \n\nThe key points to consider are intent versus impact. The author's intent is positive\u2014they want to stop harassment. However, the impact might not align with that intent. If their actions lead to more conflict or if others feel they're adding to the problem by being confrontational, that's a negative impact. Also, the author acknowledges that they find it funny, which might suggest a lack of empathy for the cat-caller's reaction or the potential escalation.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does public shaming actually discourage catcalling? Some might argue that a more effective method is direct confrontation or reporting to authorities. But others might say that public accountability works in some contexts. \n\nLegal aspects? In most places, catcalling is not a criminal act unless it's part of a pattern of harassment. The author's response is a form of free speech, so unless they're inciting violence, it's probably protected. However, if their heckling leads to a physical fight, that could be a different story. \n\nSocial norms also play a role. In some cultures, public confrontation is more accepted, while in others, it might be seen as inappropriate. The author is in a big city, which typically has more diverse opinions, so mixed reactions make sense. \n\nThe author's size and the fact that no one has physically confronted them yet might mean they feel safe, but others might not be in the same position. This could imply that their method isn't universally applicable or safe for everyone else. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to reduce harassment, the method might not be the most effective or considerate. The answer hinges on whether the means justify the ends. If the action leads to more conflict or is seen as disruptive, then maybe they are in the wrong. But if it's helping to create a deterrent effect without causing harm, then perhaps not. The community's mixed reactions suggest that opinions are divided, but the author's approach is controversial.\n"
