Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started loudly boooooing cat-callers as a way to stop them. They mention that people think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere.\n\nSo, the key points here are: cat-calling is generally considered harassment, and the author is trying to stop it publicly. Their method is disruptive but not physically aggressive. They get cussed at but haven't faced physical consequences yet.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Legally, in many places, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and intervening could be seen as standing up against it. However, the method of intervention\u2014loudly heckling\u2014might be considered confrontational. But is that inherently wrong?\n\nEthically, supporting a victim or preventing harassment is generally seen as positive. However, the author's approach might draw attention to the situation, which some argue could escalate things. The author acknowledges that women think they're making it worse by drawing attention, which is a valid concern because sometimes public confrontations can put the victim in a more awkward position.\n\nBut the author's intention is to stop the harassment. The question is whether their method is appropriate. Since there's no physical harm and the author is using their voice to support a victim, it's a form of advocacy. However, the effectiveness is debatable. Some might say it's a good way to encourage others to speak up, while others think it's not the best approach.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't directly harming the cat-caller beyond verbal confrontation. Unless their actions lead to a physical altercation, which hasn't happened yet, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The cat-caller is the one initiating harassment, so the author is trying to counter that.\n\nBut the author's method might not be the most effective or respectful. Maybe a better approach would be to support the victim discreetly or report the harassment. However, the author is choosing a public confrontation, which some might see as justified given the context.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are aimed at stopping harassment, which is a positive intent. While the method could be debated, the intent is good. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance since the method might not be the best. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about the effectiveness or best practices.\n"
