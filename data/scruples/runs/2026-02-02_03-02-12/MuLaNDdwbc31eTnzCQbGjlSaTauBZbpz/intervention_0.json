Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author is responding to cat-calling by making loud boos. They mention that their intention is to discourage the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers. They also note that others think they're an asshole, but they believe they're doing the right thing.\n\nSo, is this a case of standing up against harassment? Maybe. But the method is public confrontation. The author is using a form of public shaming. On one hand, cat-calling is inappropriate and should be addressed. On the other, publicly humiliating someone might not be the best approach. However, the author isn't engaging in physical violence or using hate speech. They're using a humorous method, like booing a villain. \n\nBut does that escalate the situation? The author mentions that cat-callers respond with curses and threats, but no actual harm. The author is confident in their ability to handle themselves. \n\nNow, considering different perspectives: some might say that intervening is good, even if the method is unorthodox. Others might argue that it's not the author's place to act as a vigilante. Also, the author is aware of potential hypocrisy. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are justified in the context of addressing harassment. The author isn't causing physical harm but is using a non-violent, public response. While it might be seen as confrontational, it's not illegal. The question is about being in the wrong, which is subjective. \n\nI think the author's intentions are good, but the method could be debated. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author is trying to prevent harassment and not causing direct harm, the answer might be B. But some might argue the approach is unhelpful. However, given the information, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
