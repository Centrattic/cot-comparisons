Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-caller. The author has a history of disliking cat-calling and has started to publicly confront it by making loud noises. They've received negative reactions from the cat-callers, and others have mixed opinions. The question is whether the author's actions are justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is unacceptable. The author is trying to stop this behavior, which is a positive intent. However, the method involves public confrontation, which can be seen as aggressive. The author argues that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might deter them, but others feel it draws more attention or escalates the situation.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, cat-calling is protected under free speech unless it's targeted and harassing. If the heckling is a form of speech, it might also be protected, but there's a line when it comes to provoking violence. The author mentions getting threats, which could be a concern.\n\nSocial norms: Publicly shaming someone can be seen as a form of vigilantism. While the intent is good, the approach might not be the most effective. Some might argue that it's better to report incidents to authorities rather than confront directly, which could lead to more serious consequences.\n\nEffectiveness: The author's method might discourage some, but others might feel it's not the best way. It's possible that the heckling could escalate tensions, making the situation worse for everyone involved. The mixed reactions from others suggest that this approach isn't universally accepted.\n\nPersonal responsibility: The author is trying to take personal responsibility for their values, which is commendable. However, they need to consider if their actions are contributing to a solution or creating more conflict. The threat of violence is a real risk, even if it hasn't materialized yet.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is to address a harmful behavior, the method might be problematic. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a line from right to wrong because the approach is confrontational and might not be effective, leading to potential escalation. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method, though well-intentioned, could exacerbate the problem and create a hostile environment.\n"
