Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author moved to a big city and started making it their habit to respond to cat-calling by \"booo\"ing loudly, like a silent movie villain. They get some negative reactions, but no physical harm yet. The person is big, so they feel confident. Others think they're an asshole; some people think they're a white knight or that they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior, while also finding it funny.\n\nNow, the key points here are about cat-calling, which is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to counter that behavior. But the method is public heckling, which might not be the best approach.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, cat-calling is unwanted and harassing, so standing up against it is commendable. The author's intention is to prevent such behavior, which is a positive goal. On the other hand, the method of loudly \"booo\"ing could potentially escalate the situation. It might draw more attention, making the victim (the person being cat-called) feel more uncomfortable, even if the intention is good. Also, the author mentions that people think they're an asshole, and that could lead to confrontations where someone gets hurt, even if it hasn't happened yet.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for making the situation worse. If someone is being cat-called, adding another loud person might not be the best support. It's possible that the person being harassed doesn't want attention drawn, so the author's method could be counterproductive. The author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also speak up, but if it's not effective and causes more issues, then it's questionable.\n\nAlso, the author admits to finding it funny, which might downplay the seriousness of the harassment. The humor aspect could be seen as insensitively handling a serious issue. Even if the intention is good, the method might not be the most effective or respectful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a grey area. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether their actions are considered inappropriate despite the good intentions. Some might argue that standing up against harassment is right, but others say the method is wrong. However, the author is using public confrontation which could have unintended negative consequences. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach might not be the best way to address the issue and could be causing more harm than good, even if their intentions are good. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the focus is on the intent to stop harassment, then B (not wrong). But the common AITA answer would likely lean towards A because the method is problematic, even with good intentions.\n"
