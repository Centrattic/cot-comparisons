Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who loudly heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that they move to a big city and start doing this for two months. Their method is making a \"*booo!*\" sound like in a silent movie. The cat-callers get angry, sometimes cuss them out or threaten them, but the author is big and no one has actually attacked them. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, they might discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others tell the cat-caller to stop. They also admit they find it funny, which is a bit of a red flag. \n\nNow, the possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). I need to think about the ethical implications here. On one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and the author is trying to stop it, which is a good intention. But the method they're using is to loudly mock the cat-caller. \n\nBut here's the catch: when you heckle someone, even if they're doing something wrong, it might escalate the situation. The author is getting threats, which shows that the cat-callers are taking it personally. The question is whether the author's actions are appropriate. \n\nThe article mentions that other people think they're an asshole. The guys think they're a white knight, which might mean they see the author as overstepping, while the girls think it draws more attention and makes things worse. So there's a split in public opinion. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, is it okay to confront someone in a public way that gets them angry? The author is using public shaming, which can be a form of social punishment. However, the targets are other men, and the author is doing this to discourage harassment. The problem is that the author is also making the situation uncomfortable for the women, perhaps? If the cat-caller is already being ignored, the author's heckling might not help. But if the author is trying to create a safer environment by making the cat-caller feel embarrassed, maybe that's okay. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is not the one being harassed. They are a third party stepping in. The cat-caller is directed at the women, not the author. So by heckling the cat-caller, the author is taking a stand against the harassment, which is a positive action. However, the method of doing so\u2014publicly mocking them with a \"*booo!*\" might be seen as disruptive or confrontational. \n\nWait, but in some contexts, public shaming can be a valid form of social control. If the cat-caller is doing something wrong, and the author is using a non-violent, non-threatening method to call them out, maybe that's justified. But if the \"*booo!*\" is directed in a way that's making the situation worse for the women being harassed, like drawing more attention to them or making them feel more targeted, then it's counterproductive. \n\nThe author says their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior. But if the women themselves are the ones being harassed, maybe they don't want strangers getting involved. Also, the author is a man, so some might question their role in this scenario. Could this lead to unintended consequences, like the women feeling more threatened if the situation escalates? \n\nAnother angle: the author is taking a stand against harassment, which is a good thing. But the method might not be effective. The girls' reaction is that the author is making it worse by drawing attention. So if the author's action leads to more aggression towards the women, that's bad. \n\nBut the author isn't physically confronting them, just making a loud, mocking sound. It's a form of social disapproval, which can be a way to shame the harasser. The question is whether this is acceptable. \n\nIn some communities, bystander intervention is encouraged. The author is a bystander here. But the method of intervention is key. If it's non-confrontational and doesn't escalate, it's better. However, the \"*booo!*\" might be seen as childish or not serious enough. \n\nAlso, the author is a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they might be intimidating. If they use their physical presence to mock someone, maybe that's aggressive and could be perceived as bullying the harasser. \n\nBut the harasser is already acting aggressively. The author's response is a peaceful, non-violent way to counter that. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHowever, the author is not the victim here. The women are the ones being harassed. The author's intervention could be seen as taking over the situation, which might not be helpful. The women might prefer a different kind of intervention or none at all. \n\nAnother point: the author is getting threats from the cat-callers, which shows their actions are effective in making the cat-caller uncomfortable. But if the cat-caller is already facing social disapproval from the author's actions, maybe it's working. \n\nBut if the author's heckling is causing more embarrassment to the women, then it's not helpful. However, the author is not shouting at the women, just at the cat-callers. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention is to stop harassment, which is good. The method is a non-violent form of social shaming. However, the effectiveness is questionable, and there's a risk of making the situation worse for the women. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If their action is non-violent and they're not causing harm beyond the cat-caller's discomfort, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if their method is counterproductive, possibly making the women feel more targeted, then they are. \n\nThe girls' opinion is that it's making it worse. So if the author is actually causing more harm than good, even if their intention is good, maybe they are in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because their method could be counterproductive and not respectful.\n"
