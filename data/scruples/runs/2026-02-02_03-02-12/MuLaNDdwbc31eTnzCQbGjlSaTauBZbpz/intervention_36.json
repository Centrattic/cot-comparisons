Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're at fault for loudly heckling cat-callers. The person describes their action as a response to a pet peeve, and they've been doing this for two months in a big city. Their method is making a loud \"booo!\" sound like a silent movie villain, which sometimes leads to cussing and threats from the cat-callers but no actual physical confrontations yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment, especially towards women, and it's meant to make them feel uncomfortable. The author is trying to counteract that by drawing attention to the cat-callers and making them uncomfortable. That seems like a good intention. However, the methods they're using\u2014loud heckling\u2014might be causing more attention to the situation.\n\nNow, the arguments for the author being in the wrong (A) could include that their actions might escalate the situation. For example, if their heckling draws more attention to the cat-caller, it could potentially make the victim feel more targeted. Also, some people, both men and women, think the author is drawing unnecessary attention and making things worse. Additionally, the author mentions that they find it funny, which might be seen as not taking the issue seriously enough.\n\nOn the other hand, arguments for the author not being in the wrong (B) would center around the idea that they are addressing a harmful behavior. By making the cat-callers uncomfortable, they might be deterring such behavior in the future. The author isn't physically confronting anyone, just using a verbal response. They also haven't caused any actual harm, just verbal threats from others. Plus, the author's intention is to create a safer atmosphere by encouraging others to stop the behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of free speech. People have the right to express disapproval, and heckling is a form of expression. However, this needs to be balanced against the potential for causing more harm. The question is whether their method is effective or counterproductive.\n\nI should also consider societal norms and what's commonly accepted. In some places, public shaming or heckling might be seen as a form of activism, while in others, it might be viewed as inciting a confrontation. The author is in a big city, where such issues are more prevalent, but the effectiveness of their approach is debatable.\n\nThe author acknowledges that others think they're an asshole, but they believe their actions could have a positive impact. It's possible that while the intention is good, the method isn't the most effective. Maybe a different approach could be better, like reporting to authorities or supporting systemic changes. But does that mean the author is in the wrong for their current approach?\n\nIn summary, the key factors are: the intent to stop harassment (positive), the method of verbal response (possibly negative), the risk of escalation (concern), and the perception from others. The line between standing up against harassment and causing further issues is thin here. I need to decide if the author's actions cross that line.\n"
