Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, the author is in a big city and has a habit of loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers. They mention that they do this to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior. They also note that their actions have led to some backlash, with people cussing them and threatening violence, but the author isn't getting physically harmed. \n\nThe author's rationale is that by making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers, they might stop, and perhaps encourage others to also stop such behavior. However, others around them (both men and women) think the author is an asshole. Men think they're being a \"white knight\" (which might mean they're overstepping or seeking validation), while women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address this in a public space, which could be seen as standing up against harassment. Their intent is to create a change, which is commendable. However, the method is public heckling, which could be seen as confrontational.\n\nOn the other hand, heckling could escalate the situation. While the author isn't using physical violence, the loud disapproval might be seen as aggressive. Some might argue that it's not the author's place to police others in public, and that it could make the situation more confrontational, potentially putting others at risk. Also, women might feel that drawing attention to the situation could make them more vulnerable if the cat-caller becomes more aggressive.\n\nBut the author is not physically intervening, just using verbal disapproval. It's a form of public shaming, which is a gray area. Some might support it as a way to hold people accountable, while others might see it as overstepping. The author's size might also play a role in their confidence to do this, but others might not feel safe doing the same.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. If it's discouraging the behavior, maybe it's helpful. But if it's causing more conflict, maybe it's counterproductive. The author admits some people think they're making it worse. Also, the author finds it funny, which could imply that the motivation isn't purely altruistic. That might affect how others perceive their intentions.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's subjective. The author is trying to address a harmful behavior, but the method is controversial. Laws and social norms vary, but in many places, verbal confrontation without physical harm is protected speech. However, creating a hostile environment for others could be an issue. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't clear-cut. However, the author's intent is to stop harassment, which is positive, but the method might be problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If \"in the wrong\" means acting immorally or unethically, it's debatable. They might be seen as taking a stand, but others might see it as unnecessary confrontation. \n\nI think the answer would depend on perspective. Since the author isn't causing physical harm and is responding to harassment, some might side with them. However, others might argue that they should let authorities handle it or address it in a less confrontational way. But since the author is using their own judgment and not physically interfering, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author could be seen as overstepping, but also as trying to make a positive change. \n\nHmm. Given that cat-calling is generally viewed as bad, and the author is trying to counter it, even if their method is questionable, they might not be entirely in the wrong. However, the potential for escalating situations and the mixed reactions from others suggest that there's a case to be made that they're overreaching. But since the question is from the author's perspective, asking if they're the asshole, the answer might hinge on the effectiveness and appropriateness of their method. Since the author isn't causing physical harm and is motivated by a desire to stop harassment, perhaps they're not in the wrong. But others might disagree. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because while the method is debatable, the intent is to address a harmful behavior, and without physical harm, it's protected speech. However, the answer could also be A if considering that it's not their place and might make situations worse. But given the context, B seems plausible.\n"
