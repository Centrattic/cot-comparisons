Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started boos at cat-callers. They mention that they do this to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior. They've had some negative reactions, like cussing and threats, but no physical altercations. Friends and others have different opinions: some think they're a white knight, others that they're making it worse.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author's actions are justified. On one hand, cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so standing up against it might be seen as right. But the method here is public heckling, which could be seen as confrontation. The author's approach might escalate the situation, even if their intent is good. The question is about intent vs. impact. \n\nThe author's rationale is to create a culture where others also stop such behavior. But by drawing attention, maybe they're putting the target (the person being cat-called) in a more uncomfortable situation. Also, some people might think that direct confrontation isn't the best approach and could lead to more conflict. However, others might argue that it's a valid form of protest against harassment.\n\nLegally, unless the author is inciting violence or using threats, public heckling might be protected speech. But socially, it's a gray area. The author is trying to be proactive, but the effectiveness and appropriateness of the method are in question. It's possible that there are better ways to address the issue without creating more tension, like reporting to authorities or supporting broader societal change. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since their intent is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal, but their method might have unintended negative consequences, it's a mix. However, the key is that the author isn't using violence or threats, just verbal protest. So, some might say they're not in the wrong, others might say the approach is flawed. The answer might hinge on whether the method is effective and respectful. Given the information, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong, but they could consider alternative methods for better results.\n"
