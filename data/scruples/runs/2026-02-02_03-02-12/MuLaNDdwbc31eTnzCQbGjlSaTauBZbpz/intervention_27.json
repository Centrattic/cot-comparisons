Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers in a big city, which has led to some backlash, including curses and threats. The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly discourage their behavior. The question is whether this makes the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment and is wrong. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the offenders. But is there a line where the author's actions become counterproductive or also inappropriate?\n\nFrom one perspective, the author is taking a stand against harassment, which is commendable. They are using their voice to support victims and possibly deter future harassment. Public shaming can be a form of social pressure, which might be effective in some cases.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that the author's method is not the best approach. Drawing attention to the situation could escalate tensions, making it unsafe for everyone involved. Additionally, the author mentions that some people think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. There's also the aspect of personal safety; even though the author feels physically capable, there's a risk of conflict escalating beyond words.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of the method. If the author's intention is to discourage cat-calling, is public shaming actually effective? Studies or common sense might suggest that while it could work in some instances, it might not address the root causes or prevent future incidents. Also, the author finds it funny, which might seem dismissive of the serious nature of harassment.\n\nBut then, the author is not physically confronting anyone, just verbally responding. The line between standing up against harassment and becoming a provocateur is thin here. If the cat-calling is a form of harassment, the author's response is a form of direct intervention. However, the reactions from others (both men and women) suggest that opinions are divided. Some see the author as a white knight, others as someone making things worse.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions, while well-intentioned, cross into being an asshole. The term \"asshole\" here is subjective. If the author is genuinely trying to help and reduce harassment, even if their method isn't perfect, they might not be in the wrong. But if the method is counterproductive or harmful, that's a different story.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a form of intervention aimed at stopping harassment. While the method has its drawbacks, the intent seems positive. Unless there's a clear harm caused beyond verbal confrontation, the author might not be in the wrong. However, considering the potential for escalation and mixed public opinion, the answer could hinge on whether the intervention is deemed constructive or just disruptive.\n"
