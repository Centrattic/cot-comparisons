Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The scenario is that the author started doing this after moving to a big city. They loudly \"booo\" cat-callers, which sometimes leads to cussing and threats, but no actual violence. People around think the author is an asshole, with different opinions from men and women. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, plus they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified or not. Cat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to stop it, which seems good, but their method is heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The key points to consider are: intention, method, consequences, and societal norms.\n\nThe intention is to discourage bad behavior, which is positive. However, the method is loud public shaming. While some might support this as a form of social accountability, others might argue that it escalates the situation. The author mentions getting threats, but no actual harm has occurred. The question is whether the means justify the ends here.\n\nAnother angle is bystander intervention. There are recommended ways to intervene safely, like direct confrontation, seeking help from authorities, or using non-confrontational methods. The author's approach is confrontational and public, which could be seen as effective in deterring the behavior, but it also risks making things worse. The author is big, so maybe they can handle the threats, but others might not be as fortunate.\n\nThe opinions of others are mixed. Men see the author as a white knight, while women think it draws attention and makes things worse. Women might be more aware of the risks of confrontation in such situations, as cat-calling is a form of gender-based harassment. Their perspective might be that public shaming could escalate the situation or put others in more danger, especially if the cat-caller becomes aggressive.\n\nThe author's admission that they find it funny could be seen as using the situation for personal amusement, which might undermine their good intentions. However, this doesn't necessarily make their action wrong, but it does add a self-serving element.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a debate on the best ways to address harassment. Some advocate for direct intervention, others for non-confrontational methods. The line between standing up against harassment and becoming a harasser oneself is thin. The author's method, while well-intentioned, might cross that line by using public humiliation instead of more constructive approaches.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the method of intervention is causing more harm than good or is inappropriate, then yes. However, if it's an effective deterrent without causing actual harm, then maybe not. The fact that no one has followed through on threats might suggest it's working, but the potential for escalation is a concern. Also, the author's size might make them a safer person to intervene, but that's not a justification if the method itself is problematic.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer could lean either way. But since the question is about being in the wrong, it's about whether their actions violate social or moral norms. Public shaming, even of cat-callers, can be seen as inappropriate because it's confrontational and might not address the root issue. The better approach might be to support the victim, report the behavior, or use non-confrontational methods. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their method is counterproductive and potentially harmful, even if their intention is good.\n"
