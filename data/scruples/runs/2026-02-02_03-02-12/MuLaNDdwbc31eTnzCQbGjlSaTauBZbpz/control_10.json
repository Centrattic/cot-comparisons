Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is making a habit of loud \"boos\" when cat-calling happens, which leads to some backlash. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. Cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment, especially towards women. The author is trying to stand up against it by publicly shaming the cat-callers. On one hand, this could be seen as a positive action to deter such behavior. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author mentions that people around them think they're being an asshole. Men think they're being a \"white knight,\" possibly overstepping, and women think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior, but others might see it as escalating the situation.\n\nI need to think about the ethics here. Is it okay to confront someone's harassment in a public way? If the method is non-violent but disruptive, is that justified? The author isn't using violence, just verbal response. However, by drawing attention, maybe they're putting the victim in a more uncomfortable position. For example, if the cat-caller is being booed, the victim might feel self-conscious or embarrassed because of the attention on them. Alternatively, the presence of someone confronting the harasser might make the victim feel safer.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking it upon themselves to act as a moral arbiter. Is that their role? Some might argue that it's not their place to police others' behavior in that way. Also, could this lead to unintended consequences, like the cat-caller becoming more aggressive or retaliating against the author or the victim?\n\nBut then again, bystander intervention is encouraged in many contexts to prevent harassment and violence. The author is trying to create a culture where people feel safe. However, the method might be questionable. The \"booo\" sound is a form of social shaming, which can be effective but might also be seen as mocking or condescending. The author's approach might not address the root issue but instead create a confrontational environment.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal safety. The author mentions being a \"big fucker,\" so maybe they feel physically safe, but others might not. If others try to replicate this method without the same confidence or physique, it could lead to dangerous situations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, is public shaming an acceptable form of protest? In some contexts, it's common (like heckling in a political protest), but in others, it might be seen as inappropriate. The key difference here is that it's targeted at harassment, which is a social issue. However, the author's method might be seen as overstepping because they aren't the authority to enforce social norms in that way.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's method is effective and appropriate. If their intention is good but the method causes more harm, then they might be in the wrong. However, if their action is a legitimate form of standing up against harassment without causing harm, then they aren't. The author is not using violence but is using social pressure, which can be a gray area.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's approach might not be the best because it could make the situation more uncomfortable for the victim and doesn't address the harassment effectively. Instead of creating a supportive environment, they might be adding to the problem. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong). Alternatively, if the action is non-violent and aims to stop harassment, maybe B (not wrong). It's a tough call, but given the responses from peers and the potential for making the situation worse, A might be the correct choice.\n"
