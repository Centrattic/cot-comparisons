Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down. The author moved to a big city and started using a \"booo!\" sound to mock cat-callers, trying to make them uncomfortable. They got some backlash, and people think they're an asshole. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so interfering with that is usually a good thing. The author is trying to discourage the behavior, which is positive. But the method is public heckling, which might be seen as confrontational. The argument is whether their approach is appropriate.\n\nThe author says they're trying to create discomfort for the cat-caller to stop the behavior. That makes sense as a deterrent. But some people might argue that the heckling draws more attention to the situation, which could make the victim uncomfortable. However, the author is not directly confronting the victim, just the cat-caller. \n\nAlso, the author is physically capable and hasn't faced actual harm, which might suggest that their method is effective in deterring violence. The counterpoint is that it's not the author's role to police others, even if they're doing something wrong. But then again, bystander intervention is often encouraged in such situations.\n\nThe AITA format usually looks at social norms. If the author's intent is good, and the method isn't directly harmful (just verbal), then they might not be in the wrong. However, the reaction from others (both men and women) suggests there's a divide in opinions. \n\nI think the key here is the intention versus the impact. If the intention is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal, and the method is non-violent, then it's a matter of whether the means are justified. Since cat-calling is widely considered inappropriate, the author is addressing a harmful behavior. Even if some people criticize their approach, the core action is against harassment, which is right. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
