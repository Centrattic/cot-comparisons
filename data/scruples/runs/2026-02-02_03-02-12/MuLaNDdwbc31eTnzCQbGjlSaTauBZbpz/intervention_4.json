Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about heckling cat-callers by making a loud \"booo!\" sound. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's reasoning is that cat-calling is a problem, and by making a public reaction, they're trying to discourage the behavior. They mention that it's been effective so far, with cat-callers getting angry but no physical confrontations. Their rationale is that making the cat-callers uncomfortable might reduce the behavior and create a better environment. They also admit that others think they're an asshole, with some thinking they're overstepping and potentially making the situation worse by drawing attention.\n\nOn the other hand, the counterarguments are that the author is using a public shaming tactic, which could be seen as aggressive or confrontational. Some people might argue that it's not their place to police others, and that this method could escalate tensions instead of resolving them. Also, there's the point that women might feel that drawing attention could make the situation worse, perhaps by making them feel more targeted or causing the cat-caller to become more aggressive.\n\nI should consider the context: the author is in a big city where this kind of behavior is common. The method they're using is non-physical, just a loud sound and maybe some mockery. The effectiveness is debatable. The question is whether their actions are justified as a form of social intervention or if they're overstepping.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n1. Intent vs. Impact: The author's intent is to stop harassment, but the impact might be counterproductive.\n2. Public vs. Private Shaming: Is it appropriate to publicly shame someone for their behavior in public?\n3. Personal Responsibility: Should individuals take it upon themselves to act as enforcers of social norms?\n4. Alternatives: Are there better ways to address cat-calling without confrontation?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that no one has physically confronted them yet, but there are threats. That suggests a potential risk of escalation, which could be a concern.\n\nLooking at societal norms, some might see it as a positive action against harassment, while others might view it as vigilantism. The key here is whether the author's actions are considered within the bounds of acceptable public behavior to address a social issue.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the principle of proportionality is important. Is the response (heckling) proportional to the offense (cat-calling)? Also, the principle of non-maleficence\u2014do they avoid causing harm, or are they causing more harm by making the situation tense?\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. If the author's actions are actually reducing cat-calling in their area, that could support their actions. But if it's causing more conflict without changing behavior, it's a problem.\n\nI should also think about legal aspects. In most places, public harassment is protected under free speech unless it's threatening. Cat-calling is a form of public harassment, but the author's heckling might also be seen as protected speech. So legally, the author isn't breaking the law by responding.\n\nBut the question is about moral or social wrongness, not legal. So the answer would hinge on social norms and ethical considerations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent is to address harassment, which is a positive goal. However, the method might not be the most effective or considerate. While the action isn't inherently wrong, the judgment could be split. The answer might depend on whether the community perceives it as helpful or harmful. The author's own acknowledgment of others' opinions adds nuance\u2014some see them as a \"white knight\" and others as an asshole. The key is whether the approach is constructive. Since the author is not using violence and is trying to create a better environment, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the potential for making the situation worse for the victims is a valid concern. So, the answer might be B (No), but with reservations.\n"
