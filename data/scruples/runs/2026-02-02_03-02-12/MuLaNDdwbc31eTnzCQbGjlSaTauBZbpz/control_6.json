Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's situation is that they've started loudly \"boooing\" cat-callers in a big city, which is their way of trying to stop the behavior. They mention that people think they're an asshole, either for being a \"white knight\" or for making things worse by drawing attention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's motivation is to discourage cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. That seems like a good intent. However, the method involves directly confronting them in a public way, which might be seen as escalating the situation. The question is whether this response is appropriate or if it's crossing a line.\n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment, and bystanders often feel powerless. The author is trying to be an ally to the victims by publicly shaming the cat-callers. Some might argue that this is a valid form of intervention, especially if it deters future incidents. The author also mentions that no one has physically confronted them yet, so maybe their approach isn't leading to violence, which is a positive.\n\nOn the other hand, critics might say that loud heckling could escalate the situation, making it more dangerous for everyone involved. The author admits that people think they're an asshole. The argument here is that drawing attention might not be helpful and could put the victims in a worse spot, as the focus shifts to the heckler instead of the harasser. Also, the author's amusement at the situation might trivialize the seriousness of cat-calling, which is a real issue with potential for harassment and intimidation.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does loudly boooing actually stop the behavior, or does it just create more conflict? If the goal is to create a culture where others also intervene, maybe the method is flawed. Also, the author mentions they are physically imposing, which might make others less likely to retaliate, but what if someone less physically capable tried this? The advice might not be universally applicable.\n\nLegally, in many places, cat-calling is considered harassment, and bystanders intervening are often protected. However, the method of intervention matters. If the author's heckling is considered a form of civil disobedience or a peaceful protest, maybe it's justified. But if it's seen as provocation, that could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some communities might support direct confrontation as a way to combat harassment, while others might prefer more subtle or institutional solutions. The author is in a big city where such issues might be more prevalent, so their actions could be part of a broader movement.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions have good intentions but might have unintended consequences. While the intent to stop harassment is commendable, the method could be counterproductive. It's possible that the author is in the right in intent but wrong in execution. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether their actions are effective and appropriate. Given the mixed reactions and potential for escalation, some might argue they are in the wrong, while others might support their approach. Given the options (A or B), and considering that the author's actions, while well-meaning, could be seen as exacerbating the problem, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
