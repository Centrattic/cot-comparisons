Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author is in a big city and has started this habit for two months. Their motivation is to combat catcalling, which they personally find objectionable. They use a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain, which leads to some backlash from the cat-callers. The responses they get are mostly from others who think they're being an asshole. The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly deter them, while also trying to create a culture where others intervene. However, some people think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the appropriateness of the author's actions. On one hand, they're trying to address a harmful behavior (catcalling), which is a valid concern. On the other hand, their method involves public confrontation, which might have unintended consequences. \n\nThe question is whether this makes them the asshole. The answer depends on the perspective. The author's intent is positive\u2014they want to stop harassment. However, their method could be seen as escalating the situation. For example, if the heckling leads to more aggression from the cat-callers or puts the author in a risky situation, that's a downside. Also, some argue that direct confrontation might not be the most effective way and could draw unnecessary attention, making the victims uncomfortable too.\n\nBut considering that catcalling is a pervasive issue and bystander intervention is encouraged in many anti-harassment strategies, the author's approach might be seen as a form of standing up against harassment. However, the effectiveness and appropriateness of the method matter. The author's size and confidence might reduce their personal risk, but it's still a judgment call on whether their actions are constructive or just disruptive.\n\nIn some contexts, public shaming or heckling can be a form of social accountability. However, it's possible that a more constructive approach, like reporting incidents or encouraging others to speak up, might be better. The author's actions might be well-intentioned but could be counterproductive if they cause more harm than good.\n\nSo, weighing the intent against the potential consequences, the answer isn't straightforward. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the actions are meant to combat harassment, which is a socially negative behavior, the author's intent aligns with a positive goal. However, the method's effectiveness and appropriateness are debatable. Depending on cultural norms and specific situations, the answer might vary. But generally, trying to address harassment, even if the method is debatable, might not make the author the asshole. So I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong), but with reservations.\n"
