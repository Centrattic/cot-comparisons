Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers by making a loud \"booo!\" sound. The author's rationale is to discourage the behavior by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. They mention getting some backlash but no actual harm so far.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so the author is trying to address a problem. However, their method is public shaming, which can be controversial. Public shaming can sometimes escalate situations or make others uncomfortable. The author acknowledges that others think they're an asshole, with some people thinking it draws attention and makes things worse.\n\nBut the author's intention is to create a deterrent effect. They believe that by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, they might stop the behavior. It's a form of direct action without physical confrontation. The question is whether this action is justified. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other hand, their method might not be the most effective or respectful. The line between addressing harassment and becoming part of the problem can be thin. Public heckling could be seen as a form of vigilantism. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might indicate a lack of seriousness about the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. Even though no one has physically confronted the author yet, there's a risk that someone might retaliate. The author's confidence in their physical size might not account for other factors like surprise or group attacks.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a debate about how to address harassment. Some might support the author's proactive stance, while others might prefer more structured solutions like reporting to authorities or supporting policies against harassment. The author's method is immediate but informal.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, is the author in the wrong? The key points are the intent to stop harassment versus the method used. If the method is causing more harm or discomfort than good, maybe. But if it's effective in deterring the behavior and not escalating things, perhaps not. The answer hinges on whether the means justify the ends and if there's a better alternative.\n"
