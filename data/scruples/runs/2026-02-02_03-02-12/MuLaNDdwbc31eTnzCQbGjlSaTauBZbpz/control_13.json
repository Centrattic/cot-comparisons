Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers for two months after moving to a big city. They justify it as trying to discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others would also tell cat-callers to stop. They mention that people think they're an asshole, with guys saying they're a \"white knight\" and girls saying it draws attention and makes things worse. The author also admits to finding it funny but is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the ethics of their actions. Cat-calling is generally considered unacceptable and harassing. The author is taking a stand against it by publicly shaming the offenders. But is their method appropriate?\n\nOn one hand, confronting harassment can be seen as a positive action. Supporting victims and discouraging harassment are good things. Public shaming could deter others from cat-calling. However, the method here is loud heckling, which might escalate the situation. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, which could make the situation more confrontational.\n\nThe author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior. But some argue that it draws more attention to the situation, potentially embarrassing the victim further or escalating the conflict. The author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't been physically attacked, but others might not be so lucky. Also, the effectiveness of this approach is debatable. Does public shaming actually stop the behavior, or does it just create more tension?\n\nAnother angle: The author is taking matters into their own hands. While the intent is good, maybe the method isn't the most effective or safe. Some might say that it's not their place to intervene in that way, and that it could lead to unintended consequences. Others might support it as a form of allyship.\n\nAlso, the author admits to hypocrisy (their pet peeve but then acting as a hypocrite) by engaging in this behavior. But hypocrisy doesn't necessarily make the action wrong if the intent is positive.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, public shaming can be a gray area. It's a form of direct action, which some support for social change, while others find it confrontational and potentially harmful. The question is whether the author's actions are justified given the intent and the outcomes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider that the intent is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal, but the method could be counterproductive or escalate the situation, then it's a judgment call. However, since the question is about being in the \"wrong,\" which typically relates to moral or ethical standards, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to address a problematic behavior. On the other hand, if their method is causing more harm (like drawing attention, creating a hostile environment), they could be seen as contributing to the problem.\n\nBut given that cat-calling is widely seen as unacceptable, the author is supporting a positive cause. The method might be debatable, but the intent isn't malicious. So, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but with a note that the method could be improved. However, some might argue that the approach is inappropriate regardless of intent. It's a tricky balance between standing up against harassment and using the right methods.\n"
