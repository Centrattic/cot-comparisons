Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author started doing this after moving to a big city, two months ago. Their main reason is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior. They also mention that some people think they're a \"white knight\" or an asshole, and that their actions might be making situations worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of intervening in such situations. Catcalling is generally considered harassment and is wrong. The author's intention is to stop it by making the harassers feel bad. But the method they use is public heckling, like booing. That could be seen as a form of public shaming. \n\nPublic shaming can have mixed effects. On one hand, it might deter the person from continuing, as they feel embarrassed. On the other, it could escalate the situation, making the harasser more aggressive. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, which shows some negative reactions. However, they also say no one has followed through on the threats, so maybe they're safe for now.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at the intent, they want to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. But the method might be problematic. Intervening directly could be seen as standing up against harassment, which is good. However, the way they do it\u2014loudly booing\u2014might not be the most effective or safe approach. \n\nSome people might argue that public shaming isn't the right way to handle harassment. It could draw more attention to the incident, potentially embarrassing the victim more. The girls in the scenario think it makes things worse, which is a valid perspective. Also, the author might be putting themselves in a position where they could be harmed, even though they say they're a \"fairly big fucker.\"\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"being the change.\" The author believes that by acting this way, they contribute to a culture where others also stop the behavior. That could be effective in the long run, but it's unclear if it's the best approach. There's also the possibility that their actions might not actually discourage the cat-caller but instead make the victim feel more exposed.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The intent is good, but the method might not be. The author is taking a stand against harassment, which is commendable, but the approach could be counterproductive. It's possible that more constructive methods, like calmly confronting the harasser or supporting the victim privately, might be better. \n\nSo, considering the possible negative consequences and the mixed opinions from others, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but there's a counterpoint. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the action is seen as helpful, maybe B. But if the method is harmful or not the best approach, then A. Since the author is causing discomfort but also getting negative reactions and possibly making the victim more uncomfortable, it's debatable. The community's opinion is split, but the author's rationale is to stop the behavior, which is good. However, the way they do it might not be the most effective or respectful. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A, because even though the intent is good, the method could be seen as aggressive or not appropriate, and the author is causing a scene which might not help the victim. Plus, the threats they receive could lead to more harm. So, even if they mean well, their actions might be counterproductive or unsafe.\n"
