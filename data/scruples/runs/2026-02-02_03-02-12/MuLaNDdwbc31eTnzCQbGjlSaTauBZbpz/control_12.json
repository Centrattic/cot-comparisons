Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author explains that they started doing this as a way to combat catcalling, using loud \"boos\" to mock the perpetrators. They mention that their actions have led to some negative reactions, like curses and threats, but they haven't been physically assaulted yet. They also note that others both support and criticize them, with some thinking they're a white knight and others, like women, saying they're making things worse. The author's rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, so the author is trying to address a harmful behavior. However, their method involves public confrontation. Is this justified? On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other hand, loud heckling could escalate the situation, potentially putting others at risk. The author mentions that women think it draws attention and makes it worse. That's a valid concern because if the cat-caller becomes more aggressive due to the reaction, the victims could be in more danger. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of personal safety. The author might be putting themselves in a confrontational position, but they claim to be a \"big fucker\" so they don't fear physical retaliation. However, their actions might not be the most effective way to stop harassment. Maybe a better approach is to report to authorities or educate others rather than confront directly in a public, confrontational manner.\n\nAnother angle is the principle of not responding with aggression. Some might argue that responding with mockery could perpetuate a cycle of hostility. The author's method is a form of vigilantism, which might not be the best approach. It's possible that creating a hostile environment for the cat-caller isn't the most constructive way to address the issue. \n\nBut then again, the author's intention is to deter future behavior. If their actions do lead to the cat-callers feeling publicly shamed, maybe they'll think twice. However, the effectiveness is questionable. Also, the author is using their own judgment to police others, which could lead to overstepping. \n\nConsidering the community's opinion, since others are divided, but the women's perspective is that it's making things worse, that's a stronger concern because the primary victims of catcalling are women. If the author's actions are causing more harm, even unintentionally, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nSo weighing all factors: the intent is good, but the method might be counterproductive or harmful. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes) because the author's approach could be making the situation worse, even if their intentions are good. Alternatively, if the method is seen as a justified form of direct action against harassment, then B (No). But given that women are advising against it, and the potential for escalation, A seems more likely.\n"
