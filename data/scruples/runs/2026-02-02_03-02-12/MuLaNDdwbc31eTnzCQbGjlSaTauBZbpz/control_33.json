Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in a big city, and they've started heckling cat-callers with a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. They mention that they get cussed at and sometimes threatened, but no one has actually attacked them. People around them, both men and women, have different opinions. Men think they're a white knight asking for trouble, women think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a culture where others stop it too. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening could be seen as standing up against harassment. But the method here is public heckling. The author is using a confrontational approach, which might escalate the situation. The woman's perspective is that it draws attention and could make the victim feel worse. Maybe they feel that being the center of attention in such a situation is uncomfortable. On the other hand, the author's intent is to stop the harassment by making the harasser uncomfortable.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, it's a gray area. Legally, cat-calling is a form of harassment, so intervening could be justified. But the method matters. If the author's actions are causing more harm, maybe. But if it's effective in stopping the harassment without escalating violence, maybe not. The author isn't using physical force, just verbal. However, the confrontational approach might not be the best. Maybe a more supportive approach towards the victim would be better, like offering assistance or reporting the incident rather than directly confronting the harasser publicly.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they are a \"fairly big fucker,\" implying they can handle threats, but others might not be in that position. Their method might not be scalable or safe for everyone. Public shaming could backfire, leading to more aggression. Women might feel that adding another layer of confrontation could make them feel unsafe. The author's rationale is to create a culture where others stop the behavior, but if their approach is seen as disruptive or counterproductive by those affected, it's possible they are causing more harm than good.\n\nBut then again, taking a stand against harassment is positive. The line between right and wrong here is blurry. The author's intentions are good, but the execution might be problematic. So, is the author in the wrong? If the method is causing more issues than solving them, then A. But if it's a legitimate way to combat harassment, then B.\n\nConsidering societal norms and the potential consequences, maybe the answer is A because the approach could be counterproductive and not the most effective or considerate way to address the issue. The women's perspective that it draws attention and makes the situation worse is a valid concern. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong despite good intentions.\n"
