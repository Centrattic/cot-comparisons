Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is in a big city and has started this habit of loudly booing people who catcall others. They mention that some people think they're a white knight or an asshole, but their rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally considered harassment, so intervening might be seen as standing up against harassment. But the method the author uses is loud public heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The question is whether this response crosses a line.\n\nThe author argues that their intention is to create a deterrent effect. However, their actions might escalate the situation. For example, if the cat-caller responds with threats, the author's intervention could lead to a more hostile environment. Also, the author is a \"big fucker,\" which suggests they might be physically imposing, so others might view their presence as intimidating regardless of intent.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for drawing attention. The author mentions that others think it makes things worse by attracting more attention. If the catcallers become more aggressive or if the situation becomes a spectacle, it could backfire. However, the author believes making the cat-caller uncomfortable is justified.\n\nThere's also the aspect of personal responsibility. The author might be trying to enforce social norms, but using public shaming. While catcalling is wrong, the method of response could be seen as vigilantism. It's possible that the author isn't accountable to any authority, so their actions might not be sanctioned.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author's actions lead to a reduction in catcalling, that could be a positive outcome. But if it leads to violence or worse harassment, that's negative. The author hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but that's a risk.\n\nI need to balance the intent (good) against the method (potentially confrontational). While the goal is commendable, the approach might not be the most effective or appropriate. There's a difference between advocating for respectful behavior and publicly shaming someone, which could be seen as hypocritical if the author isn't a bystander in other situations. Also, the author admitted to being a potential hypocrite, which adds complexity.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, is the author in the wrong? Well, the answer depends on whether the method of intervention is appropriate. If the author is trying to address a problem but using a method that escalates the situation and could be seen as aggressive, then maybe they are in the wrong. Alternatively, if it's seen as a form of justified public resistance against harassment, they might not be. The consensus in the scenario is that others think they're an asshole, which leans towards them being in the wrong. But their intent is good. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just popularity. So, if their actions violate social norms or laws, that's a factor. Since catcalling is harassment, but the author's response is heckling, which is different. It's a gray area. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is good, the method of public heckling might be inappropriate and counterproductive, leading to the author being in the wrong.\n"
