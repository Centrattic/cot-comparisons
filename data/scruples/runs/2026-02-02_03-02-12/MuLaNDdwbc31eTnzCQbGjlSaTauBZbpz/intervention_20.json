Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The scenario is that they're making a loud \"booo!\" to mock the cat-caller, which sometimes leads to verbal abuse but no physical harm. The person argues that they want to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe foster a better environment.\n\nFirst, cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment, especially when directed at women. The heckling here is a form of public intervention. So, is theheckler overstepping? On one hand, intervening in harassment is positive. But the method involves public shaming and confrontation, which could escalate tensions. The user mentions that people around think they're an asshole\u2014some women think it draws more attention. \n\nThe author's rationale is to create a culture where others intervene. However, public shaming might not be the best approach. If the heckling leads to more conflict, it could backfire. Also, the person is getting cussed out and threatened but not stopping. The question is whether their actions are justified despite the reactions.\n\nI think the key points are: the intent is to stop harassment, which is good, but the method might not be effective or safe. Public confrontation can sometimes make situations worse. The author is not in the wrong for trying to help, but maybe there's a better way. But according to the question, it's about being in the wrong. Since their actions are a form of intervention against harassment, even if the method is questionable, their intent is positive. So maybe answer B, not in the wrong. However, others might argue that the method is inappropriate. Hmm. Need to weigh intent vs. method.\n"
