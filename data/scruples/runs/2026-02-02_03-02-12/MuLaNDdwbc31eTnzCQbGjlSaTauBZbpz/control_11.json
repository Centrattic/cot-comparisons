Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of that AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has started loudly \"booo\"-ing cat-callers in a big city. Their reason is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and potentially discourage the behavior. They mention that some people think they're a \"white knight\" or that they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author is conflicted because they might be an asshole and should stop, hence the question.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the action (publicly shaming cat-callers), the intent (discourage harassment), and the reactions from others. \n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is inappropriate. The author's response is to confront it publicly. But is their method problematic?\n\nOn one hand, publicly shaming someone can escalate the situation. The cat-caller might feel attacked and respond aggressively. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, which shows it's confrontational. Also, some people think it draws more attention, making the situation worse for the victim. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent is to create a safer environment by discouraging harassment. They might believe that by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, they are standing up against harassment. However, the effectiveness of this method is questionable. Does publicly shaming someone actually stop them from cat-calling in the future? Maybe not, and it could make the situation more hostile.\n\nAlso, the author admits to possibly being a hypocrite, which might indicate they're aware of their own flaws. But the main issue is whether their actions are justified. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Cat-calling is wrong, so trying to stop it is good, but the method might not be the best. Maybe a better approach would be to support the victim discreetly or report the behavior rather than confront the harasser publicly, which could escalate things. \n\nSo, considering that the author's actions might be counterproductive and could potentially make things worse for everyone involved, including the victims, it might be that they are in the wrong. But it's not clear-cut. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's method could be seen as aggressive and possibly harmful, the answer might lean towards A (yes). But others might argue it's a form of standing up against harassment. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. Since their intention is to stop harassment, which is right, but the method is questionable. However, public confrontation can be seen as inappropriate, especially if it leads to threats or escalates the situation. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
