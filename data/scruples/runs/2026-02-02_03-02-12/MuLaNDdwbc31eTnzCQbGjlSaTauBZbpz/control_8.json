Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down. The author moved to a big city and started loudly \"booo\"ing cat-callers, trying to be the change they want to see. They get some backlash, but no one has physically confronted them yet. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, often making women and others feel unsafe. The author is trying to stop this behavior, which is a positive intent. But their method is public heckling, which might have mixed results. \n\nNow, the possible arguments against the author: Maybe they're escalating the situation. If they draw more attention, it could make the victim feel more embarrassed or in danger. Also, using humor (like the silent movie reference) might not be taken seriously. The guy's approach might come off as performative, making him a \"white knight\" in the eyes of some. And even though he's big and hasn't been physically attacked, verbal threats are still a risk.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to discourage harassment by making the cat-caller uncomfortable. It's a proactive approach, and it seems to have some support from other people who think it's a good idea. The key here is whether the method is effective and respectful. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Legally, unless he's inciting violence or breaking specific laws, it's probably okay. Ethically, it's more nuanced. If his actions are helping to create a safer environment without directly harming others, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if his heckling is causing more harm (like drawing attention to the victim), then it could be problematic. \n\nThe responses from others are split: some guys think he's a white knight, while women think it's making it worse. The author acknowledges the possibility that they're an asshole. The main point is whether the method is effective and considerate. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his actions are genuinely helping. If he's making the cat-caller stop and not causing harm to others, maybe not. But if it's causing more issues, then perhaps it's not the best approach. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the intent is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal, but the method has potential downsides, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the author is trying to address a problem, so the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is that they are in the wrong because their approach might not be the best way to help.\n"
