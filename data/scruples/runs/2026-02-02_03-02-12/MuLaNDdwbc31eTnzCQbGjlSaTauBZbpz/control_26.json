Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The author's situation is that they publicly shame cat-callers by booing them, which sometimes leads to verbal abuse and threats. They mention that people think they're an asshole, with some believing they're inciting violence or making things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is harmful. The author's intent is to discourage this behavior by making the perpetrators uncomfortable. That seems like a good intention. However, the method used\u2014publicly humiliating them with loud boos\u2014might escalate the situation. \n\nOn one hand, the author is taking a stand against harassment, which is a positive thing. Their rationale is to create a deterrent effect, which could potentially reduce harassment. On the other hand, the approach might draw attention to the situation, possibly putting others at risk if the cat-caller reacts aggressively. The author mentions that they are big and haven't been attacked yet, but there's still a risk involved.\n\nAlso, the people around them, both men and women, have mixed reactions. Some men think it's a futile act, while women believe it draws more attention. It's possible that the author's method isn't effective and might even be counterproductive. Public confrontation can sometimes lead to defensiveness or more aggression from the perpetrator.\n\nAnother angle is the right to free speech versus the right to be safe. The author is expressing their disapproval, but the cat-caller is engaging in harassment. The balance here is tricky. While the author's actions are a form of protest, they might not be the best way to address the issue. Maybe a more constructive approach, like reporting incidents or promoting awareness through other means, would be better.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent is good, but the method might be problematic. They could be in the wrong if their actions inadvertently make the situation worse or put others at risk. It's possible that a different approach would be more effective and less confrontational. So, while the motivation is positive, the execution could be questionable.\n"
