Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started loudly boos cat-callers. Their reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They mention that some people think they're a white knight or that they're drawing attention and making things worse. The author gets cursed at but hasn't been physically harmed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is the author's method effective? Is it appropriate? Does it escalate the situation? \n\nCat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address it by public shaming. But public shaming can have mixed results. It might stop the behavior in the moment, but could also lead to the cat-caller becoming more aggressive. Also, the author is putting themselves in a confrontational position. \n\nThe author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also speak up. But if the response is negative from others, maybe that approach isn't fostering the desired environment. Also, the author admits some people think they're an asshole. \n\nBut then again, the alternative is doing nothing. The author is trying to stand up against harassment. However, the method might not be the most effective or safe. It's possible that by making a scene, they're drawing more attention to the situation, which could be uncomfortable for everyone involved, including the victims. \n\nI should consider if there's a better way to address cat-calling. Reporting to authorities, supporting the victims discreetly, or using non-confrontational methods might be more effective. But the author is trying to use peer pressure on the cat-callers. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're trying to address harassment, which is a positive intent. But the method might be problematic. It could lead to escalation, and maybe isn't the most constructive approach. However, if the author isn't harming anyone except the cat-caller (who's already engaged in harmful behavior), is it wrong? \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions might be seen as justified in standing up against harassment, but the approach could be improved. However, since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer depends on whether their actions are considered acceptable under the circumstances. \n\nSome might argue that the author is taking a stand, which is commendable, but others might say it's counterproductive. Given that the author is not physically confronting, just making noise, it's a form of protest. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's a caveat that their method could be improved. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about the effectiveness. If the action is legal and not directly harmful beyond the confrontation, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe in social terms, they're seen as an asshole because they're drawing attention and not helping the victims directly. But the author's intent is good. It's tricky. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, but I'm not entirely sure. However, given the options and the need to choose between A and B, based on the analysis that while the method could be better, the intent is positive and they're not engaging in harmful actions beyond confronting the cat-caller, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
