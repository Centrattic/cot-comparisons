Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The author's main point is that they're trying to stop cat-calling by making it uncomfortable for the perpetrators. They admit people think they're an asshole, but their reasoning is about discouraging the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so trying to stop it could be justified. However, the method here is public heckling with a \"booo!\" which might escalate the situation. The author mentions that the cat-callers get angry and threaten them, but no actual harm has happened.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other hand, their method could be seen as confrontational and possibly making the situation worse by drawing more attention. The author even acknowledges that others think they're causing more harm than good.\n\nBut the key point is whether their actions are morally wrong. Since the intent is to stop harassment, which is a valid concern, maybe the method is debatable but the intent isn't. However, using public humiliation (mocking like a silent movie villain) might not be the best approach. It could lead to more conflict instead of a calm resolution.\n\nThe author also admits to finding it funny, which might suggest some hypocrisy since they're criticizing others' behavior. However, their actions do aim to reduce harassment. The responses from others (people thinking they're an asshole) might indicate that the approach isn't socially accepted, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's morally wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The intent is good, but the method could be problematic. If their actions lead to escalation rather than resolution, maybe they are contributing to the problem. However, since they're trying to address harassment, which is a valid issue, maybe they are not in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether the means justify the ends here.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the intention is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. However, the effectiveness of the method is questionable. But the question is about being in the wrong, not effectiveness. Since the author is trying to address a harmful behavior, even if the approach is flawed, they might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if their method is causing more harm, they could be. But the question is whether they are in the wrong, not just if their method is the best. Without a clear harm done beyond words, it's hard to say they are in the wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
