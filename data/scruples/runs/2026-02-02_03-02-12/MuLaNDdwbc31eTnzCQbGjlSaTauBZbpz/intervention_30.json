Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author is responding to random men shouting at others by loudly booing them, which leads to some backlash. They mention that others think they're an asshole, but their rationale is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and possibly discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered unacceptable and harassing behavior. The author is trying to counter that by publicly shaming the perpetrators, which could be seen as a form of social intervention. However, the method they're using\u2014loudly booing\u2014might be seen as confrontational or escalating the situation.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions might be viewed as standing up against harassment, which is commendable. They are using their voice to challenge inappropriate behavior, which could help create a safer environment for others. Their approach is direct and aims to deter future incidents by making the cat-caller feel socially unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is inserting themselves into a situation that doesn't involve them. The cat-caller might feel targeted or provoked, leading to a potential escalation. The author acknowledges that people, both men and women, think they're an asshole. Men worry they're overstepping, while women think they're drawing too much attention. The key issue here is whether the author's method is effective and appropriate.\n\nThe author's intention is to discourage cat-calling by making the perpetrator uncomfortable. But does publicly shaming someone in a public space cross a line? It's possible that the cat-caller might become defensive or aggressive, which the author is already experiencing with the threats. However, the author mentions they are physically intimidating, so maybe they feel safe in that context.\n\nAnother angle is the societal expectation of how to address harassment. Some might prefer a more supportive approach, like intervening privately or encouraging victims to report incidents. The author's method is public and confrontational, which could be seen as effective in the moment but potentially harmful if it leads to retaliation or makes the victim feel more uncomfortable.\n\nLegally, there's no mention of any laws being broken here. The author isn't using threats or violence, just verbal response. So legally, they might be in the right. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The effectiveness of the method is debatable. Public shaming can work as a deterrent, but it can also lead to backlash or further aggression.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are aimed at addressing a negative behavior, which is a positive intent. However, the method chosen may not be the most effective or considerate approach. While they might not be \"in the wrong\" legally or ethically in a strict sense, the potential for causing more conflict or unintended consequences is present. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's intent is to stop harassment, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong.\n"
