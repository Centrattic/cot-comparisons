Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been loudly making fun of cat-callers by doing a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie. They get some negative reactions back, but they think it might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. People around them think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered unwanted and harassing behavior, especially towards women. The author is trying to stand up against that, which seems positive. However, their method is to mock the cat-callers publicly. The question is whether this is an appropriate response.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address a problem by making the cat-caller uncomfortable, which could deter them. It's a form of bystander intervention, which can be effective. But on the other hand, if the heckling leads to escalation or puts the author in a dangerous situation, that's a concern. The author mentions they're a big person and no one has acted on the threats, but there's still risk involved.\n\nAnother angle is the reaction of others. If others think the author is making things worse by drawing attention, maybe their approach isn't the best. Women's perspectives here are important\u2014some might appreciate the intervention, others might feel like it's not their role to handle it that way. The author's own admission of hypocrisy (being a \"hypocrite\" for being a big person) is interesting. Maybe they feel they can handle the confrontation better, but that's not necessarily justifying their actions.\n\nThe author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable could discourage the behavior. While that might work sometimes, it's also possible that it could escalate the situation. If someone is being harassed, the best approach might depend on the context. However, the author is not the victim here; they're a bystander. Is it their responsibility to intervene, or is it better to leave it to the victim to handle? Also, the humor aspect\u2014while the author finds it funny, others might not, and it could be seen as aggressive or inappropriate.\n\nLegal considerations? In most places, cat-calling is not illegal unless it's part of a pattern of harassment. The author's heckling is a form of free speech, so probably not illegal either. But does that matter in terms of being in the wrong ethically?\n\nThe key points are: addressing harassment is good, but the method might be problematic. Public shaming (the boos) could be seen as a form of vigilantism. If the author's actions make the environment more hostile for everyone, that's a negative. However, if it's effective in stopping harassment without causing more harm, it's a positive. The balance between the two is tricky.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If their actions are effective and not causing more harm, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if their method is counterproductive or could be seen as overstepping, then they might be. Since the author is a bystander and not the victim, their intervention might not be necessary, and could potentially make things worse for the victim by drawing attention to them. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're inserting themselves into a situation where their method isn't the best approach, even if their intentions are good.\n"
