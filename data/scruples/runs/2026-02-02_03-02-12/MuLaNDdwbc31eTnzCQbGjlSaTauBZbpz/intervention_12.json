Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author started doing this to address a pet peeve, using a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie. They get some negative reactions, but they argue it's to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. The community's reactions are split: some guys think they're a white knight risking a fight, while women think they're making it worse. The author is unsure if they're being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening is usually seen as positive. But the method here is public heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The author's intent is good\u2014to discourage harassment\u2014but the approach might have unintended consequences. \n\nThe key points are: Is the author's method effective? Do their actions escalate the situation? What are the societal norms around intervening in such cases? Publicly shaming someone might not always work and could lead to more conflict. However, the author isn't physically confronting the cat-callers, just using a crowd-like response. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that people don't think they're in the wrong, but others think they're an asshole. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to weigh the pros and cons. Maybe the author's actions do help, but the threats they receive could be a risk. Also, if the heckling draws attention, it might make the situation worse for the person being cat-called, as the article suggests. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the method is non-violent and their intent is to stop harassment, maybe not. But there's a debate about the best way to intervene. Some might say they should instead report or involve authorities, or support the victim silently. However, the author isn't harming the cat-caller, just trying to discourage them. \n\nIn conclusion, while the approach is debatable, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their intent is to address harassment, and they're not using violence. But it's a nuanced situation where different perspectives exist. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
