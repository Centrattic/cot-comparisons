Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person has been heckling cat-callers by making loud \"booo!\" sounds, like at a villain in a movie. They mention that people, both guys and girls, have different reactions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment, especially towards women. The author is trying to counter this behavior by publicly shaming the cat-callers. Their intention is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. They acknowledge that some people think they're an asshole, but they believe they're doing it for a good reason.\n\nNow, the key points here might be about the method used. Is publicly heckling someone's harassment acceptable? On one hand, the author is trying to address a negative behavior, which is good. On the other hand, their method might be seen as adding to the disruption or potentially escalating the situation. The author mentions that they get cursed at and sometimes threatened, but they're physically imposing and no one has attacked them yet.\n\nAnother angle is whether the heckling is effective. The author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable could deter them. But do other people, especially the women, think it's making things worse by drawing more attention? There's a possibility that their actions could make the victims feel more self-conscious or unsafe, even if that's not the intention.\n\nAlso, the author admits to possibly being a hypocrite, given their own pet peeve about random dudes shouting. Maybe there's some personal motivation here, like feeling the need to assert dominance or humor. However, the intention is to create a better environment by discouraging harassment.\n\nLegally, unless the heckling involves threatening language or incites violence, it's probably protected speech. But the question is more about social wrongness rather than legality. The author isn't physically harming anyone, just using a loud verbal response.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that public shaming is a form of vigilantism. Others might see it as a necessary action in a city where cat-calling is common. The author's method doesn't involve violence, but it's confrontational. It's a balance between standing up for others and potentially causing more conflict.\n\nThe responses from others are mixed: guys think the author is a \"white knight\" (meaning well but possibly naive or overstepping), while girls think it draws attention and could make the situation worse. The effectiveness and impact on the victims is a concern here. If the victims are more uncomfortable because of the heckling, then maybe it's counterproductive. But if it's making the cat-caller stop, then maybe it's effective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a form of trying to address harassment, but the method could be problematic. It's a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong if the intent is to stop harassment and if the method doesn't escalate violence, but there's room for debate. Since the question is a yes/no, and the author's actions are a reaction to harassment without causing direct harm, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But some might argue A because it's disruptive and could make things worse. However, given that the author is trying to help, and given that cat-calling is a serious issue, the answer is likely B.\n"
