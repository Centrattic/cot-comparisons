Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author started doing this two months ago after moving to a big city. Their main goal is to make cat-calling uncomfortable for the perpetrators, hoping to discourage the behavior. They use loud \"booo!\" sounds like in a silent movie. People around them think they're an asshole, with some guys calling them a \"white knight\" and girls saying they're making things worse. The author's rationale is about creating a deterrent and maybe fostering a culture where others also speak up. They also admit they find it funny, which might be an issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment or disrespect, especially towards women. So, intervening in some way might be seen as positive. But the method here is public heckling, which can escalate tension. The author is using a confrontational approach, which might not be the best way to address the issue.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to stop harmful behavior. That's commendable. On the other hand, their method could be seen as aggressive or disruptive. The key question is whether the means justify the ends. If the goal is to stop harassment, is loud heckling an effective method, or does it just create more conflict without solving the problem?\n\nAlso, the reactions from others matter. If the author's approach is causing more harm, like drawing attention and potentially making the victims feel more vulnerable, then maybe it's counterproductive. The author mentions that some women think it makes things worse. That's a significant point because the intended beneficiaries (the people being cat-called) might not appreciate the intervention method.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. If the cat-callers respond with threats or aggression, even if the author is physically capable, it could lead to dangerous situations. The author might be putting themselves and others at risk by provoking confrontation.\n\nMoreover, the author's personal enjoyment (\"find it funny\") could indicate a lack of sensitivity towards the seriousness of the issue. While humor can be a coping mechanism, in this context, it might undermine the gravity of the problem.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, bystander intervention is encouraged, but it's important to use methods that are safe and effective. Non-confrontational approaches, like reporting to authorities or supporting the victim discreetly, might be more appropriate. The author's method is public and direct, which could be counterproductive.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's intentions are good, but the method is questionable. They might not be in the wrong if the intent is to stop harassment, but the approach could be improved. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer might depend on whether the method is ethically acceptable despite the approach's flaws. If the method is causing more harm than good, then the author could be in the wrong. But if the intent is right and the method is just not optimal, maybe not.\n"
