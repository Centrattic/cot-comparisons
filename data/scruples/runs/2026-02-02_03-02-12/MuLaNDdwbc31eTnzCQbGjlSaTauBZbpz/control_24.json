Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author moved to a big city and has taken it upon themselves to loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers, like a silent movie villain. They mention that this has been happening for two months. Their reasoning is that by making the cat-callers uncomfortable, they might discourage the behavior and help create an atmosphere where others also speak up against it. However, they've faced backlash from both sides: guys think they're being a white knight, and girls think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author is conflicted because they want to be part of the solution but are being called an asshole. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Cat-calling is generally considered a form of harassment and is disrespectful. The author is trying to address this behavior in a public space. But their method is public heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's actions are justified or if they overstep. On one hand, they're trying to stop harassment, which is a positive intent. On the other hand, their method might be counterproductive. The author mentions that women think it's making the situation worse by drawing attention. There's a risk that the cat-caller might escalate the situation if they feel targeted. Also, the author is a \"big fucker\" and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but others might not be as safe.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of the method. Does public shaming actually reduce cat-calling? Some might argue that it could make the cat-caller more defensive or aggressive. Also, there's the issue of bystander intervention. The ideal approach is to support the victim without putting them in more danger. By stepping in, the author is taking a stance, but the method could be problematic.\n\nThe author's humor about it might also be a factor. If they're taking it lightly, maybe they aren't considering the seriousness of the harassment. However, their intent to create an atmosphere where others speak up might have merit in the long run.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. While cat-calling is wrong, how to address it is debatable. Some might say direct confrontation in public is not the best approach. Others might support any method that deters harassment. The author could be seen as trying to protect others, but the method might not be the most effective or safest.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one cat-calling, so their intent is to help. But is it their responsibility to act in this way? Maybe, but the approach could be improved. For example, supporting the victim discreetly or reporting the incident might be better. The author's loud heckling could unintentionally place the victim in a more uncomfortable position, especially if the cat-caller turns aggressive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intent is to stop harassment, the method employed might be counterproductive and could potentially escalate the situation. They are trying to do good but might not be considering the possible negative consequences. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for using a confrontational approach that could harm the very people they're trying to help.\n"
