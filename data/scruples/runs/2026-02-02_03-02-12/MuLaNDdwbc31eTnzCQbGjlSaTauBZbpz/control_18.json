Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation involves the author publicly confronting cat-callers by making loud noises, which leads to some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and unwelcome. The author is trying to address this by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. But is their method justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to discourage bad behavior, which is a positive goal. Standing up against harassment can be important. However, the method involves public shaming. Public shaming can be a gray area. While it might deter the cat-caller, it could also escalate the situation. The author mentions that some people think they're making things worse by drawing attention. \n\nAlso, the author is a \"fairly big fucker\" and hasn't faced physical confrontation, but that doesn't mean it's safe or appropriate. There's a risk of escalating into a physical altercation, which could be dangerous for everyone involved. Moreover, the author is being hypocritical by acknowledging their own pet peeve but acting in a way that others see as problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness. Does public shaming actually reduce cat-calling long-term? There's no evidence provided that this method works. It might just create a hostile environment without addressing the root issue. The author's rationale is that it makes the cat-callers uncomfortable, but that's not a universally accepted justification. \n\nThe responses from others are divided: some see the author as a white knight, others as an asshole. The key here is whether the author's actions are more harmful than helpful. Public confrontation can sometimes be a form of support for the victim, but if it's not asked for, it might not be welcomed either. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intention is good, the method of publicly shaming might not be the right approach. It could be seen as the author taking justice into their own hands, which can lead to more problems. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their approach could be counterproductive and potentially harmful, even if the motive is positive.\n"
