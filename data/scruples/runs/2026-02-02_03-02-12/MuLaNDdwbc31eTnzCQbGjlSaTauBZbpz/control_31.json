Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author's main point is that they're trying to discourage catcalling by making the perpetrators uncomfortable. They admit it's a new habit and that people are split on whether they're helping or causing more issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Catcalling is generally seen as inappropriate and unwanted attention, often making women and others feel unsafe. The author is trying to combat this by publicly shaming the catcallers. On one hand, their intent is to stop harmful behavior, which is a positive goal. On the other hand, the method\u2014loudly heckling\u2014could escalate the situation. \n\nThe author mentions that their actions sometimes result in angry responses from the catcallers, but they haven't faced physical consequences. The question is whether their approach is justified. Some arguments against their actions might be that it could draw unwanted attention to the victim, potentially making the situation worse. Also, using public shaming might not effectively deter the behavior and could lead to conflict.\n\nHowever, the author's intent is to create an environment where people discourage each other from catcalling. They also admit it's partly for their own satisfaction. The key here is whether the method is appropriate. Since catcalling is the initial wrongdoing, the author's response is a form of direct intervention. Depending on the context, like the setting and the people involved, it might be seen as a reasonable response. But if it's causing more harm, like escalating tensions or putting others at risk, it could be problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Their intent is good, but the method's effectiveness and potential downsides matter. Since the question is about being in the wrong, not just effectiveness, I need to consider social norms. Publicly confronting someone in this way could be seen as taking sides in a way that's not constructive. However, given that catcalling is widely considered unacceptable, intervening might be seen as justified. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal views on how to address harassment. Given that the author is trying to stop a harmful act, even if their method isn't perfect, they might not be in the wrong. But if their actions are causing more harm, they could be. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the intent is to stop harassment, but there's a case to be made for A if the method is counterproductive. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. So, maybe B is the answer here.\n"
