Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The user says they're in a big city and have been doing this for two months. Their main reason is that they dislike random dudes shouting at others. They compare it to being a \"white knight\" but acknowledge they might be a hypocrite. \n\nSo, the author uses loud \"booo!\" sounds at cat-callers, which gets them cussed at and sometimes threatened, but they're big and no one has acted on it. People around them think they're an asshole, with some guys saying they're asking for a beating and women thinking it draws attention and makes things worse. The author's rationale is that making cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere where others tell each other off. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing behavior, especially towards women. The author is trying to counter that. But their method is to mock the cat-callers publicly. Is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, standing up against harassment can be positive. The author is trying to create a more hostile environment for the harassers, which might reduce their behavior. Their intention is to discourage it, which is a good goal. \n\nOn the other hand, the method of using loud heckling could be seen as confrontational. It's possible that this approach escalates the situation. The author mentions that people think it draws attention and makes things worse. If someone is being harassed, adding attention might not help. Also, the author is using humor, which could trivialize the issue for some. But maybe the humor is a way to defuse tension.\n\nAnother angle: The author is intervening, which is generally supported in preventing harassment. However, the method might not be the most effective or safest. If the cat-callers respond with threats, the situation could become more dangerous. The author's size gives them confidence, but others might not be so lucky. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of public disruption. The \"booo!\" might be loud and disruptive in public spaces, leading others to perceive the author as the problem. The author is trying to correct a behavior but might be seen as creating their own issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the intention is good, but the method could be problematic. The effectiveness of their approach is debatable. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not effectiveness. Legally, if they're not breaking any laws, maybe not. Ethically, if their action is seen as helping, they might not be. But if they're causing more harm by drawing attention, maybe they are. \n\nThe author acknowledges they could be an asshole and are open to stopping. The key is whether their action is a reasonable response. Since cat-calling is harassment, and intervening is generally encouraged, the author's action might be justified, even if it's not perfect. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but with considerations about method.\n"
