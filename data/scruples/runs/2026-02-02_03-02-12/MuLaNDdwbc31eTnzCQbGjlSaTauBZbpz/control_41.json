Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-collars by making a loud \"booo!\" noise. \n\nFirst, let's look at the context. The author moved to a big city two months ago and has a pet peeve about random guys shouting at others. They're trying to be the change by publicly shaming the cat-callers. Their method is to make a sound like a movie villain getting booed. The result is that they get cursed at or threatened, but they're big and no one acts on it. People around think they're an asshole. Men think they're a white knight asking for trouble, and women think it's making things worse. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might deter them and promote a culture where others stop the behavior. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nSo, the key points here are: cat-calling is generally considered harassment and is bad. The author is trying to address it in a public way. But the method is loud and confrontational. Now, the question is whether that's the author's fault.\n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is harassment, so intervening is usually seen as good. Supporting victims and stopping harassment is positive. But the author's method is to mock the harassers publicly. Is that acceptable? Well, if someone is being harassed, supporting the victim by distracting the harasser or showing support is common. But the author is not the victim here. They're a third party stepping in. \n\nBut the problem is that the author is using a confrontational method. If someone is cat-calling, the usual advice is to ignore or, if safe, tell the person to stop. However, if a third party intervenes, it's generally seen as good, but how they do it matters. Loudly booing might draw attention, which could escalate the situation. The author mentions that women think it's making things worse by drawing attention. That's a valid concern because if the cat-caller feels targeted, they might react aggressively. The author is in a position where they could cause more harm if the confrontation becomes physical. They admit they're big, so they might feel confident, but others might not.\n\nAlso, the author's own admission of hypocrisy is a clue. They mention they're about to be hypocritical, which suggests they're aware their actions might not align with their values. The question is whether their method is effective or just adding to the problem.\n\nAnother angle: laws against public harassment. If the author is using a method that's non-violent, like a loud boo, is that protected speech? In many places, yes. But if it leads to a confrontation, maybe not. But the author isn't using violence, just making a sound. \n\nSo, the author's intention is good, but the method might be questionable. They're trying to deter harassment but possibly causing more tension. However, the alternative is to do nothing, which allows harassment to continue. \n\nIn the scenario, the author is not the victim but a third party. Intervening is a good thing, but the method of intervention matters. The key is whether their method is appropriate. Publicly shaming someone through loud mocking could be seen as bullying, even if the target is a harasser. It's a form of retaliation rather than a calm intervention. \n\nAlso, the author admits that people around them think they're an asshole. That's a sign that their approach is not well-received. Women's perspective is that it's making things worse by drawing attention. So maybe the author's method is counterproductive. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are positive, but the method could be problematic. They're using a confrontational approach that might escalate situations, and their peers in the community think they're being an asshole. Even though cat-calling is bad, the way to address it should ideally de-escalate, not escalate. So, the author might be in the wrong for using a method that could make the situation worse rather than better.\n"
