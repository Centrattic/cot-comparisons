Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who's heckling cat-callers is in the wrong. The person says they do this by making a \"booo\" sound, like at a villain in a silent movie. They've been doing it for two months in a big city. The question is whether they're an asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. On one hand, cat-calling is unwanted and can make people uncomfortable. The author is trying to stand up against that, which is a good intention. They mention that their goal is to make cat-callers uncomfortable and maybe discourage the behavior. Also, they note that other people think they're an asshole, but they don't back down because they believe in their cause.\n\nBut then, there's the method. The author is loud and public in their heckling. The cat-callers respond with curses and threats. The author is big and hasn't faced physical consequences yet, but others (both men and women) think they're making things worse. The author also admits they find it funny, which could be seen as not taking it seriously.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is public heckling a valid response to cat-calling? Does it escalate the situation? The author's action might be seen as intervening, which is positive, but if it's causing more conflict, maybe it's not effective. Also, the author is using humor in their approach, which might not align with the seriousness of the issue for some people.\n\nLegal aspects? Probably not an issue here unless it's a matter of public order, but the question is about moral wrongdoing, not legal. Social norms vary, but in many places, cat-calling is considered inappropriate. However, the way to address it can be debated.\n\nWomen's perspective: They think the author is drawing attention and making it worse. That's a valid concern because sometimes public confrontations can make the victim feel more uncomfortable. But the author's intention is to stop the cat-caller.\n\nIs the author a hypocrite? They mention they're about to be hypocritical, suggesting they might have done things similar in the past. But they're trying to be the change now.\n\nThe author's rationale is about creating an atmosphere where others can intervene. That's a form of bystander intervention. However, if done in a way that's disruptive or humorous, maybe it's not the best approach.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions have good intentions but might be counterproductive. The question is whether the method is appropriate. The answer depends on whether the means justify the ends. If the heckling is effective in stopping cat-calling, maybe not in the wrong. If it's causing more harm, then maybe. But the author hasn't caused physical harm and is using their voice to oppose something wrong. However, others think it's making it worse, so there's a balance here.\n\nSince the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but others in the scenario disagree, the answer depends on the balance between intent and outcome. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author isn't physically harming anyone, just using verbal heckling, the answer might lean towards B. But there's a valid argument for A if considering that it's drawing attention and making things worse. But I think the author's intent is positive, so maybe B is correct.\n"
