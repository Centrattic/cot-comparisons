Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city and has started loudly heckling cat-callers with a \"booo!\" like a silent movie villain. They get cussed at and threatened but haven't faced physical retaliation. Their reasoning is that making the cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. However, others think they're an asshole, with some saying it draws attention and makes things worse. The author is conflicted because they find it funny but also consider stopping.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. \n\nCat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. However, their method is public heckling. The issue here is whether their response is appropriate. \n\nPublic confrontation can have mixed results. On one hand, it might deter the cat-caller. On the other, it could escalate the situation, making the victim more uncomfortable or drawing unwanted attention. The author mentions that others, especially women, think they're making it worse by drawing attention. That's a valid point because sometimes direct confrontation in public can put the person being cat-called in a harder spot, especially if they feel they have to respond or if the situation becomes more hostile.\n\nThe author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also tell cat-callers off. However, the effectiveness of this approach is debatable. Also, the fact that they're getting threats shows that their method is aggressive, which might not be the best approach. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. If the heckling leads to more aggression from the cat-caller or if it turns into a confrontation, it could put everyone involved at risk. The author is confident they can handle physical threats, but that's not the point. The goal should be to stop harassment without creating more conflict.\n\nAdditionally, the author admits to finding it funny. This might suggest that their primary motivation isn't purely altruistic, which could be seen as insensitivity. Using humor or mockery in such situations might not be respectful to the victims of the cat-calling.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while standing up against harassment is good, the method matters. There might be more effective and less confrontational ways to address the issue, such as reporting to authorities, supporting policies against harassment, or educating others privately.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the intent is good, but the method could be problematic. The author's actions might inadvertently harm the situation, especially if they make the environment more hostile or put others at risk. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong because their approach, while well-intentioned, may not be the best way to address the problem and could cause more issues than it solves.\n"
