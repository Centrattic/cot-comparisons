Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a big city, has a habit of loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers to make them uncomfortable. They admit they're getting cussed out and threats but haven't had any physical altercations. People around think they're an asshole\u2014some see them as a \"white knight\" (which might mean a self-righteous do-gooder) risking a beating, while women think they're drawing more attention and making things worse. The author's reasoning is that making cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others tell them to stop. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nSo, the key points: The author's actions are intended to stop harassment, but their method could be counterproductive. The question is whether their method crosses into being the problem themselves.\n\nCat-calling is a form of harassment, so addressing it is important. However, the method here is public shaming through loud heckling. The author's approach might escalate the situation. If they're confronting the cat-caller in a way that makes it more hostile, maybe it's not effective. The women's perspective is that it draws more attention, potentially putting victims in more vulnerable positions. For example, if a cat-caller is being heckled, the victim might feel pressured to defend themselves or get caught in the crossfire.\n\nAlso, the author is aware they might be seen as a hypocrite since they mention it's their pet peeve. But using their own approach could be problematic. The effectiveness of such a method is questionable. While the intent is good (discouraging harassment), the method might not be the best way. Public shaming can sometimes lead to defensiveness or more aggression from the harasser. Additionally, if others don't support the method, it could create a divide in how to handle harassment.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author is overstepping. While harassment is wrong, the appropriate response might involve reporting to authorities or supporting the victim rather than confronting the harasser directly, which can be unsafe. The author's method might be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which can lead to personal safety issues and potentially escalating conflicts.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to create an environment where others also speak up. But if their actions are leading to negative reactions (cussing, threats), it might not be fostering the positive change they hope for. The humor they take from the situation might also be seen as trivializing a serious issue, which could be another reason people think they're in the wrong.\n\nIn summary, while the intent to reduce harassment is good, the method of loudly heckling might be counterproductive and could be seen as adding to the problem by creating a hostile environment, not just for the cat-caller but potentially for others around. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because their approach could be making the situation worse rather than better.\n"
