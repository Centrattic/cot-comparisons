Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author joined a big city two months ago and started loudly \"booo!\" at cat-callers to make them uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They've faced some backlash, with both men and women having mixed reactions. The author's rationale is to create a better atmosphere by making cat-calling less common.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening could be seen as positive. However, the method involves public shaming, which might escalate situations. The author mentions getting cursed at and threats, but no physical harm yet. \n\nConsidering the perspectives: the author is trying to address a problem they dislike. While their approach might be confrontational, the intention is to stop harassment. However, public shaming can sometimes draw more attention to the situation, potentially making it worse, as some people (especially women) think. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might come off as mocking rather than genuinely helping.\n\nOn the other hand, bystander intervention is encouraged in many cases to support victims and deter harassers. The key is whether the method is appropriate. The \"booo!\" is non-violent and a form of social disapproval, which is a common tactic. The line between standing up against harassment and causing a scene is thin. The author isn't physically confrontational, just using verbal disapproval. \n\nPotential issues include if the heckling itself could be seen as harassment or if it's effective. The author's size might contribute to them not being physically harmed, but others might not have the same protection. The question is whether the author's actions cross into being an asshole by making the situation more uncomfortable than it already is. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at intentions and consequences. The author's intention is good, but the consequences might not align. However, since the author isn't violent and is trying to change behavior, it's debatable. The answer might hinge on whether public shaming is an acceptable form of intervention. \n\nGiven all that, the author's actions, while confrontational, are aimed at stopping harassment. They aren't causing physical harm, just verbal. So, I'm leaning towards B (author not in the wrong) because the intent is positive, even if the method is questionable.\n"
