Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author is doing this to discourage the behavior and create an atmosphere where others might also stand up against it. They mention that people around them think they're an asshole, with both men and women having different opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author's intention is to stop unwanted behavior, which is positive. However, the method involves public shaming or heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The question is whether this method is justified.\n\nCat-calling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address a problem, but their approach might escalate the situation. The responses from others indicate that even if the intent is good, the execution might not be effective. The author mentions getting cussed at and threats, which could lead to more conflict. Also, some might argue that drawing attention could make the victim uncomfortable, even if the author's intention is to help.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to create a safer environment by discouraging cat-calling. If their presence makes cat-callers think twice, maybe it's effective. But is it the right approach? Maybe there are better ways, like reporting or supporting the victims more directly.\n\nThe key here is balancing the right to address harassment with the method used. Public heckling might be seen as taking the law into one's hands, which could be problematic. It's possible that the author is overstepping, even if their motives are good. The answer might depend on cultural context too. In some places, public shaming is seen as a form of social justice, while in others, it's considered aggressive and unproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intent is noble, the method might be causing more harm than good. The author could be in the wrong because their approach may escalate situations and not be the most effective or considerate way to address the issue. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
