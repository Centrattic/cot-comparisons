Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author, in a big city, has been loudly reacting to cat-calling by making a \"booo!\" sound like a silent movie villain. They've received some verbal abuse and threats but not physical harm. The author's reasoning is that making cat-callers uncomfortable might discourage them and create a better environment. People around think the author is an asshole, with some saying it draws attention and makes things worse.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions cross a line. Cat-calling is generally considered harassment, so intervening could be seen as positive. However, the method here is public heckling. The key points here are intent and proportionality. The author's intent is to stop harassment, which is a valid concern. But the method involves confronting the cat-caller in a public way, which might escalate the situation. \n\nThe author mentions that others think they're an asshole. Some might argue that direct confrontation could make the victim (the person being cat-called) more uncomfortable, especially if they weren't expecting or wanting public attention. Also, if the heckling leads to a confrontation where things could get physical, that could be problematic. However, the author claims to be a \"big fucker\" and no one has acted on the threats yet, implying they're capable of handling themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, bystander intervention is encouraged to stop harassment. The method here is non-violent and aims to deter the cat-caller. The author's actions could be seen as a form of peaceful protest against harassment. However, the effectiveness is questionable if it draws more attention or if the victims don't appreciate it. It's a balancing act between standing up against harassment and ensuring the safety and comfort of all involved.\n\nI should also consider cultural context. In some places, public heckling might be more accepted, while in others, it's seen as overstepping. The author is in a big city, which might have a different social dynamic. The fact that the author is male and intervening in a situation that often affects women might also play a role in perception. Some might see it as a positive action, others as inappropriate for someone not directly affected.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, unless the heckling involves threats or violence, it's likely protected speech. But socially, there's a debate. The author's justification is about creating a deterrent effect, which could be valid, but if it's causing more harm (by drawing attention or escalating tensions), that's a downside.\n\nSo weighing these factors, is the author in the wrong? It's not a clear yes or no. The intent is good, but the method might be counterproductive. The fact that people perceive the author negatively suggests that there's a social cost. However, the author isn't physically harming anyone, just expressing disapproval. Given that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action is non-violent and aimed at stopping harassment, even if the approach is debatable. However, if the method is causing more harm than good, then maybe A. But since the question is about being in the wrong, which is a moral judgment, it's subjective. The author isn't breaking laws, but socially, there's a conflict. Since the user asks for A or B, and the community might split, but the main point is that the author's intent is to stop harassment, which is a positive, even if the method is flawed. So leaning towards B.\n"
