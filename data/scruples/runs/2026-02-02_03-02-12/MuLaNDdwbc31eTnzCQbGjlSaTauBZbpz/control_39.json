Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault (AITA). The situation is that the author has been loudly booing cat-callers for two months in a big city. They get curses and threats but no physical harm. People around think they're an asshole, with differing opinions from guys and girls.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere. They also admit they find it funny. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to analyze the ethics here. Cat-calling is generally considered harassing and disrespectful. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. But their method is public confrontation with loud heckling. \n\nPossible issues: While the intent is good, the method may have downsides. If the author's actions escalate the situation, maybe putting others at risk, that's a problem. However, the scenario says no one has acted on the threats yet. The author is a \"big fucker,\" so maybe they can handle themselves. \n\nHowever, the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is defending others from harassment, that's typically seen as a good deed. But the public confrontation might be disruptive. Some might argue that it's their right to speak out against harassment. Others might say it's not their place and could lead to negative consequences. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions cross the line into creating their own problem. The author isn't using violence, just verbal confrontation. Since cat-calling is the initial wrongdoing, the author's response is a form of social disapproval. In many contexts, standing up against harassment is encouraged. \n\nBut the author is getting negative feedback from both sides. Men think they're a \"white knight\" (possibly meaning they're overstepping), and women think they're drawing attention. However, the author's intent is to stop harassment. It's a gray area, but generally, supporting victims and discouraging harassment is positive. Unless the method is harmful, which here it's just verbal. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is addressing a wrong. However, if the method is counterproductive, maybe A. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author isn't committing a crime or violating clear social norms, it's more likely B. The author is acting on a moral stance against harassment, which is acceptable even if others disagree.\n"
