Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1,000 in damages. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, where the parents said not to worry about it and didn't inform the owner. The author comes back and is upset because they weren't told and aren't getting compensation. People are saying the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The kid was at fault for hitting the car, and the parents should have informed the car owner. The author's parents didn't tell them, which is a problem. The author is upset because they didn't know until they returned and there's no reimbursement. \n\nLegally, the kid's family is responsible for the damages. The parents might have tried to resolve it on the spot, but not informing the actual owner (the author) is a mistake. The author's parents might have overstepped by not passing the information along. The author is justified in wanting compensation, especially since they had to cover the costs. \n\nThe fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it, adds to the situation. The author didn't have a chance to decide how to handle the reimbursement. The neighbors not informing the owner is a key issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking what's owed to them. The problem lies with the neighbor's family not handling it properly and the parents not communicating. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
