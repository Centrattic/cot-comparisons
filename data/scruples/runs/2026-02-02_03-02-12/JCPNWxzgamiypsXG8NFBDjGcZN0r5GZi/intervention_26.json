Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his mom went to their parents' house and were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. People are telling them they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone causes damage to your property, they're typically responsible for covering the costs. The neighbor's kid was at fault here. However, since the parents were involved and the parents of the kid and the author's parents downplayed the situation, maybe there's a cultural or family dynamic at play. The author's parents might have felt it was a minor issue or didn't want to create conflict. But the author is now the one who has to bear the financial burden without any prior knowledge.\n\nEthically, the author is asking for reimbursement because they were wronged. The kid admitted fault and offered to pay, but the parents refused. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so it's reasonable for them to seek compensation. The fact that they were away and not informed adds to the injustice. The people telling them to forget it might not realize the financial impact on the author.\n\nAnother angle is that the neighbor's family was already aware of the incident and even apologized. The author's parents might have thought it was resolved, but the author wasn't part of that conversation. This creates a communication gap. The author has a right to know about the damage to their property and to seek redress. They didn't overreact by asking for reimbursement; they're holding the responsible party accountable.\n\nHowever, some might argue that since the parents of the kid and the author's parents handled it informally, the author shouldn't interfere. But the author's financial loss is real, and they weren't involved in the initial resolution. It's their property and their money, so their input is valid. The neighbor's family's decision not to compensate them doesn't absolve the responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what's fair and just, given the circumstances. The responsibility lies with the party that caused the damage, and the author's right to be informed and compensated isn't being respected here.\n"
