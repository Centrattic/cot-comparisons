Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were told but didn't inform the owner, and the kid offered to pay but the parents said not to worry. The author is upset because they weren't told and didn't get compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. But since the parents already told the kid not to worry about it, maybe the author can't claim compensation now. However, the author wasn't informed about the damage until returning, which is a problem. They might feel entitled to know and seek compensation as the car owner.\n\nSocially, the parents might think it's a minor incident, but the author is facing a $1000 cost. The parents might have dismissed it to avoid conflict. The author's frustration is understandable because they're out of pocket for something they couldn't control. \n\nBut the parents did handle the situation initially by telling the kid not to worry. If the author hadn't been informed, maybe they should have checked in on the car. However, since they were abroad, it's possible they didn't expect issues. \n\nThe key points are whether the author has a right to reimbursement after the parents already resolved it, and if not being informed is a valid point. Legally, if the parents already took responsibility, the author might not have a case. But morally, the author is in a tough spot. The answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong because the damage was done to their property without their knowledge and without compensation.\n"
