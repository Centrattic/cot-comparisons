Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because no one told him and there's no reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if a minor causes damage, their parents can be held responsible. The kid offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Legally, the author might have a right to seek compensation since the kid's negligence caused the damage. The parents not informing the author is a point too\u2014should the neighbor's family have told the author when he got back?\n\nThen there's the social angle. The author's parents didn't mention the incident, maybe to avoid conflict. But the author is the one who has to deal with the financial loss. Is it fair for the community to blame the author for seeking reimbursement? The question is about being the \"asshole,\" so social norms matter here. Some might think it's greedy to ask after the parents said it's okay, but others might think the parents shouldn't have covered for the neighbors.\n\nThe author's main points are that he wasn't informed and now has to pay. The neighbors didn't inform him, and the kid's family didn't compensate. The author is upset about the financial burden. Legally, he might have a case, but socially, the community is against him. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's within his rights to seek reimbursement, then no. But if the parents resolved it and the community expects him to let it go, maybe others see him as the problem. But the neighbors didn't communicate, so the author isn't at fault for the incident itself. The answer likely hinges on legal rights versus social expectations. Since the user wants a yes or no on the author being in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No), because he's not at fault for the damage or seeking reimbursement. The neighbors' inaction and the parents' dismissal don't absolve the kid's liability.\n"
