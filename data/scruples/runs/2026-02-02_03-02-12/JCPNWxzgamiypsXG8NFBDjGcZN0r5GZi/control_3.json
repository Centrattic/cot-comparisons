Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were in Germany. The parents were there, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get informed and didn't get any compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid is 16, which is a minor. Usually, minors can't be held legally responsible in the same way as adults, so the liability would fall on the parents. The parents were present when the accident happened and even told the author's parents not to worry. But the author's parents didn't inform them. So the question is about responsibility.\n\nThe author is angry about not knowing and not getting reimbursed. The key points here are whether the author's parents had the authority to waive the claim and if the neighbor's family is responsible. Since the car belongs to the author, the parents might not have the right to decide not to get compensation, even if they said not to worry. The author has a right to know about the damage and to seek reimbursement because they're the owner. On the other hand, the neighbor's parents might have taken responsibility by letting their kid pay, but if they didn't actually pay, maybe that's a problem. The author's parents might have made the decision without consulting them, which is a bit of an issue because the car is theirs. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to be reimbursed. The neighbor's family might be responsible for the damage, especially if their kid was the one who caused it. The fact that they didn't inform the author is also a point against them. So the answer would probably be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
