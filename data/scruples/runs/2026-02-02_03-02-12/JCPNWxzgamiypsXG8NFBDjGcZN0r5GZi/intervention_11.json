Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his parents, but didn't inform the author. Now the author is upset about the $1,000 damage and wants reimbursement. The parents and others think the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The kid caused damage, and at 16, he's a minor, so his parents would be responsible. The parents were present when the accident happened and spoke with the kid's parents. They said not to worry, but the author later found out and wants money. The parents are telling him to forget it, others think he's the asshole.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the kid caused damage, the parents would be liable. But the parents here already interacted and maybe resolved it. Did the author have a right to expect reimbursement? Did the parents have the authority to forgive the debt? Also, the author wasn't informed, which is a problem. If the parents made a decision without consulting the car owner, that's an issue. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the kid is at fault. The parents, in their position, might have a responsibility to cover the damage. But if they already told the other parents to forget it, the author is now challenging that. Is that being reasonable? The author's parents might have been in a position to forgive the debt, but the author is the owner of the car, so their right to seek compensation is valid. \n\nThe neighbors might have thought that since the parents were there, they could handle it, but the parents are separate from the author. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the author. The author's frustration comes from not being informed and being left with the financial burden. \n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, the parents of the kid would typically be responsible for the damage caused by their minor. The fact that the author's parents interacted with the kid's parents might mean they had a verbal agreement to resolve it without involving insurance or police. However, the author, as the car owner, has the right to be informed and to decide whether to accept or reject that agreement. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. The parents might have made a decision without consulting the car owner, which is problematic. The author's reaction is reasonable because they're now facing the financial loss. The neighbors and others might think it's resolved because the parents said so, but the author has a valid right to seek compensation. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
