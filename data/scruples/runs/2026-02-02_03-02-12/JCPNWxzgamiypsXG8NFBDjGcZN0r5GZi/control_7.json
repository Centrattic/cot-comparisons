Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit (the author) is in the wrong for seeking reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author left their car parked at their parents' house while they were in Germany. A 16-year-old neighbor hit the car, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. When the author returns, they find out about the damage and are upset about not being informed and not getting compensation. People are saying the author is overreacting and the asshole.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider legal and social aspects. Legally, if someone else's property is damaged, the responsible party (or their parents) should cover the costs. The kid was at fault, so the parents might be liable as they are the guardians. However, the parents might have resolved it informally by telling the author's parents not to pursue it. But the author didn't know, so they weren't part of that decision. \n\nSocially, maybe the author's parents thought it was a minor issue and didn't want to burden their son or the other family. But the author is now out $1,000, which is significant. The problem here is that the author wasn't consulted, so their parents made a decision without them. That's where the conflict arises. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author's parents handled the situation without informing them. 2) The author is now facing the financial burden. 3) The responsible party (kid's family) might have offered to pay but were dissuaded by the author's parents. \n\nLegally, the author might have a right to reimbursement since the damage was done without their knowledge. The parents might have overstepped by letting the matter drop. Socially, it's about whether it's reasonable for the author to expect compensation after the fact. \n\nIf the author's parents didn't inform them, they might be at fault for not protecting their son's interests. The kid's family might still be responsible. The author isn't the one who let it go; their parents did. So the author isn't the asshole here. They're upset because their financial loss wasn't addressed. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
