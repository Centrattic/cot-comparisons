Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were informed and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't told and have to pay out of pocket.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible for the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be liable. However, if the parents were present and agreed to cover it, maybe there's an informal agreement. But the author wasn't informed, which complicates things. Did the parents have the authority to waive the reimbursement on behalf of the car owner?\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is being asked to accept no compensation when they have to pay the repair costs. Even if the neighbor offered to pay, but the author's parents accepted the apology and said it's okay, does that absolve the neighbor's responsibility? The author is the actual victim here, so it's reasonable for them to want compensation. \n\nAlso, communication is key. The parents didn't inform the author about the incident until they returned, which left the author without the chance to handle the situation themselves. This could be a point where the parents might be at fault for not communicating properly. \n\nReddit responses often highlight that while the neighbor's intentions might be good, the financial responsibility should lie with them. The author isn't overreacting; they're seeking justice for their property. The parents might have resolved the situation informally, but that doesn't mean the author shouldn't be involved since they're the one bearing the financial burden.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility for the damage should rest with the person who caused it, and the author's request for reimbursement is justified. The neighbors, especially the parents, should have handled the compensation, not just let it slide. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
