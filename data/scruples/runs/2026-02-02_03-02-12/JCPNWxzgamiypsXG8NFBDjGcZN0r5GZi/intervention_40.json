Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents of the kid were told about it, but they were advised not to report it. The author returns to find damage and wants reimbursement, but everyone says they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. So the kid's parents should cover the costs. The fact that they were told not to worry about it by the author's parents might complicate things. But the author's parents might not have the legal right to waive that responsibility. Ethically, the author is the victim here. They didn't cause the damage, and the other party was negligent. Not being informed about the damage is another issue. The parents who were told not to worry might have agreed to let it go, but that's between them and the other parents. However, the author is the rightful owner, so they should have been informed and involved in any decision about compensation. \n\nNow, the user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. The key points are whether the author is overstepping by asking for reimbursement. Since the parents were told not to worry, maybe the author's parents accepted it, but the author is now being left with the cost. Legally, the author has a right to seek compensation. The others are dismissing their legitimate claim, which could make the author not the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
