Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now, the author is upset because they find out about the damage and didn't get reimbursed. The family and others think the author is overreacting and the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are: the car was parked at the parent's house, the parents were present when the accident happened, they interacted with the kid and his mom, and they accepted the apology and didn't push for reimbursement. The author's parents decided to let it go, so maybe the author is now trying to claim compensation after the fact. \n\nThe law part: In most places, when someone damages your car, you can claim from their insurance or require them to pay. But if the parents accepted the kid's offer to pay and said not to worry, maybe they already resolved the issue. If the parents didn't inform the author because they thought it was settled, then the author's anger about not being told could be justified because they were the owner. However, the parents might have thought they were handling it, so the author might be in a tricky spot.\n\nSocially, the parents might have felt it was a minor incident and didn't want to create a bigger issue, especially with a teenager. They might have been lenient. The author is now being blamed for not being the one to ask for reimbursement. But the responsibility for the damage is on the kid's side. The parents might not be legally obligated to pay, and the kid's parents might have responsibility to ensure the kid's actions are addressed.\n\nThe author's parents might have made a mistake by not informing the author and not getting any sort of repayment. The author is now in the position where they have to pay for the repairs. However, the author wasn't there, so maybe the parents were acting on their behalf. But the kid's parents might not be bound by the initial agreement if the author's parents didn't follow through. The author could argue that the car belongs to them, so the parents should have informed them and handled the reimbursement. But the kid's parents might say that once the author's parents said not to worry, they aren't responsible anymore.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the author might have a right to seek reimbursement since the kid was at fault. But since the parents were there and resolved it, maybe the author is out of line now. Socially, the kid apologized, and the parents forgave it, so the author's insistence on reimbursement could make them look the asshole. However, the initial resolution might not have been properly communicated to the author. So, the author's anger is partly about not being informed and not being compensated. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parents had the authority to waive the author's right to seek reimbursement. If the car is the author's, then the parents might not have the right to do that. But in practice, if the parents were acting as the caretakers, maybe others see it as already resolved. The author's responsibility is to know their own property, but the parents were there. It's possible the author is not in the wrong because the kid was responsible for the damage and the parents should have informed them. However, the author's initial reaction might be seen as overreaching since the parents didn't pursue it. So, the answer is tricky. But according to the law, the person who caused the damage is responsible. The author isn't at fault for the accident, but their parents handled the situation. The author is now upset about the financial loss they have to bear. So, the author isn't in the wrong, but the parents might be. The answer here is B.\n"
