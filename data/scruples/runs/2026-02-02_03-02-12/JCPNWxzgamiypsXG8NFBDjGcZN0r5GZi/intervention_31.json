Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away, and when they return, they want reimbursement, but everyone else says they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the facts. The kid was 16, hit the car, and then his parents went to talk to the author's parents. The parents were upset about filing a claim, and the author's parents said not to worry. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry. Now the author is angry because they found out about the damage when they came back and there's no compensation.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the car was damaged, the parents were told about it, and the author wasn't. The kid did offer to pay, but the parents didn't follow through. The author is upset about the financial loss and lack of communication.\n\nI need to consider legal aspects. If someone hits your car, they're usually responsible for damages. But since the author's parents spoke to the kid's family and they were told not to worry about it, maybe the parents handled it without the author's knowledge. But legally, the owner of the car (the author) has the right to seek compensation, even if their parents tried to handle it informally.\n\nEthically, the kid's family might argue they apologized and offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. However, the author is the one who owns the car and has to pay for repairs. They weren't consulted, so they feel wronged.\n\nThe author is being told to let it go, but is that fair? The author didn't cause the damage and is now facing unexpected costs. The kid's family might have the means to pay, and not compensating them could be seen as unfair.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're seeking what they believe is their right to be compensated for damages caused by someone else's negligence. The fact that they were not informed adds to the injustice. The parents might have overstepped by not involving the author, who is the rightful claimant.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
