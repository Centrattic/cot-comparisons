Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the parent's house and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and weren't told about the damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your car, they are responsible for the damage. But since the parents were the ones who interacted with the neighbors, maybe they had the authority to handle it. However, the car belongs to the author, not their parents. So even if the parents said not to worry, the author still has a right to seek compensation. But wait, the parents might have the right to make that decision if the car was stored at their house. But the author's perspective is that they weren't informed and now have to pay for repairs. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents chose to let it go, perhaps out of kindness or wanting to avoid conflict. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents declined. Now the author is returning and has to deal with the damage. The neighbors didn't inform the author, which is a problem. If the author wasn't the one present when the accident happened, maybe the neighbors didn't think to tell them. But the author is the owner, so not being informed is a breach of communication. \n\nThe key points are: 1. The neighbor's kid caused damage, 2. The author wasn't informed, 3. The parents handled it without consulting the author. Legally, the author might have a right to reimbursement, but if the parents accepted the apology and declined payment, maybe they can't be forced. However, the author is now facing the cost and is upset. The neighbors not informing the author is a mistake. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement, especially since the parents shouldn't have unilaterally decided on their behalf. The neighbors should have at least contacted the car's owner to discuss. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
