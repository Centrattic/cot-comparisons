Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and interacted with the kid and his parents. The kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now, the author comes back, finds out about the damage, and wants reimbursement.\n\nFirst, the kid was 16, so a minor. Parents usually have responsibility for their children's actions. The kid's family approached the author's parents, and the kid offered to pay. The author's parents didn't inform the owner. The author is upset because they weren't told and aren't being compensated.\n\nLegally, if the parents handled the situation by accepting the kid's apology and saying not to worry, maybe they waived the right to claim. But ethically, the parents of the kid should cover the damages, especially since the kid is a minor. The original owner (the author) isn't the one who interacted with the parents; their parents did. If the parents didn't communicate that the damage happened, maybe the author isn't at fault for not knowing. But the author is now seeking reimbursement, which might be seen as a problem because their parents already addressed it. However, the author's parents might have acted without consulting them, leading to the author's financial loss. It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation, especially since they weren't informed. The parents might have overstepped by not informing them and dismissing the issue. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
