Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents didn't inform them and told the kid's family not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't told and aren't getting compensation. They're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The kid is 16, which is a minor, so his parents are legally responsible. The parents were informed by the kid's family and were told to not worry about it. The author's parents didn't pass on the information. The author is now returning and is expected to cover the costs. \n\nLegally, when a minor causes damage, the parents are liable. So even if the kid apologized, the parents should cover the costs. The fact that the author's parents didn't inform them might complicate things, but the author is still the rightful owner of the car. The parents might have resolved it between them, but the author is now bearing the financial burden. \n\nThe question is about fault. The neighbor's kid caused the damage, so they are at fault. The author's parents might have been too lenient, but the author isn't responsible for the accident. The author is upset because they're being asked to absorb the cost without knowing. \n\nReddit usually considers intentions and norms. The neighbor's family tried to resolve it, but the author's parents didn't inform them. However, the author isn't at fault for the accident. They're in a tough spot because they weren't told. The parents might have handled it but without consulting the car owner. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. They have a right to know about the damage to their property. The neighbor's family, especially the parents, should have covered the cost. The author's parents might have been wrong to not inform them, but the author isn't to blame. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
