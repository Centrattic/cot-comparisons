Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1000 in damage. The parents of the kid were there, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If someone's property is damaged, the person who caused the damage is typically responsible for compensation. The kid is 16, so the parents might be responsible for any damages. But the parents were told not to worry and they agreed. However, the car owner wasn't informed. So, maybe there's an issue with the parents making that decision without consulting the actual car owner. \n\nFrom a liability standpoint, the kid caused the damage. The parents might have been the ones to talk to the kid, but they didn't inform the car owner. The car owner is now being told to accept no compensation, but they have to pay for repairs. The author is upset because they weren't part of the conversation and now have to cover the cost. \n\nBut in some cases, if the car owner left the car unattended, maybe they have some responsibility? Wait, but the car was parked at their parents' house, so maybe it's their own property. The neighbor's kid was backing up into it. So the kid's parents might be liable as they didn't supervise their child. However, since the parents resolved it with the kid's family and decided not to pursue compensation, that might be an agreement between the parents, but the car owner wasn't part of that agreement.\n\nLegally, the car owner is the one who suffered the damage. The parents might have had the authority to make a decision, but the owner wasn't consulted. So the parents might have overstepped by deciding not to seek compensation without the owner's consent. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is being blamed for asking for reimbursement, but if the damage was their kid's fault, they should be responsible. The author wasn't informed because the parents thought it was handled. However, the parents might have been wrong to not pass on the information to the car owner. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't cause the damage and were kept in the dark. The problem is that the parents made a unilateral decision. The author is justified in wanting compensation. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
