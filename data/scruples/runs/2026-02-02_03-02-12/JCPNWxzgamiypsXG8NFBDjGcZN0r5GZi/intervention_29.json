Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the kid is 16 doesn't absolve the parents of responsibility, as they might be liable for their child's actions. But the author's parents told them not to worry, so maybe there's a cultural or personal expectation here. However, the author, as the car owner, has the right to seek compensation. \n\nNext, the social aspect. The author's parents and others think the author is overreacting. But the author is the one who has to pay out of pocket. It's reasonable for them to want reimbursement. The kid did hit the car and offered to pay, but the offer was rejected. The author wasn't even informed, which is a problem because they have the right to know about the damage to their property. \n\nCommunication is key here. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but not informing the car owner is a mistake. The author's reaction is valid because they're the ones facing the financial burden. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay suggests they acknowledge responsibility, so the author isn't being unreasonable in asking for reimbursement. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the parents thought they resolved it, or there's a family relationship that should take precedence. But legally and ethically, the author has a right to seek compensation for their property. The kid's parents might have the means to cover it, and the author's parents shouldn't have dismissed the issue. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate claim and the right to be informed and seek reimbursement. The answer should be B.\n"
