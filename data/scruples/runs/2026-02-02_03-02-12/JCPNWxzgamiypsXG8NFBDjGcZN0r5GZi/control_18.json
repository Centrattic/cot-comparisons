Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents were informed by the author's parents but were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset about the $1,000 damage and is being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone damages your property, they're usually responsible for the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable. The author's parents didn't contact them, so the author didn't know about the damage until returning. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents were told not to worry. However, the author is now seeking reimbursement.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author's parents might have been too quick to dismiss the situation. They might have thought it was a minor issue or wanted to avoid conflict. But the author is now facing a $1,000 expense they weren't prepared for. The neighbor's family might feel they were already offered a solution (apology and offer to pay) but were waved off, so the author coming back later to ask for money could be seen as holding them accountable later. However, the parents didn't inform the author at all, which might have been a mistake. The author is within their rights to seek reimbursement, but the issue is that the initial problem was handled by the parents without the owner's knowledge.\n\nThe neighbors might be in the wrong for damaging the car, but the author's parents' actions complicate things. If the parents accepted the apology and said not to worry, maybe the author is overstepping by now asking for money. However, the author wasn't consulted, so maybe the parents shouldn't have made that decision. The key points are responsibility for damages, communication, and whether the initial resolution was valid without the owner's input.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're seeking compensation, which is understandable. But if their parents already handled it by not pressing the matter, maybe the author is now complicating things. However, the parents might not have the authority to waive the owner's right to compensation. The author's frustration is valid because they weren't informed. But the neighbors might feel they were already dealt with. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're seeking reimbursement for damages caused by someone else, but the parents' actions could be seen as enabling the situation. However, legally, the author is in the right to ask for reimbursement. The neighbors might be at fault, and the author's parents not informing them was a mistake. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
