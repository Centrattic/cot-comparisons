Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were there, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the author's parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and feels like others are calling them an asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. Even if the parents were present, the legal responsibility might fall on them since they're the guardians of the minor. If the parents agreed to pay but didn't, the author could have a case. However, if they were told not to worry about it and no agreement was made, that complicates things.\n\nThen there's the social angle. The parents might have resolved the issue amicably, but the author wasn't informed. The parents might have thought they were being generous, but the author is now out of pocket. The author's frustration is valid because they weren't involved in the decision and are left with the financial burden. The neighbors might not have realized the author would be the one covering the costs, especially since the author was abroad. \n\nThe neighbors' reaction to the author asking for reimbursement could be seen as dismissive. The kid offered to pay, but the parents might have taken responsibility. If the author's parents said it's okay, maybe they thought they'd handle it, but that doesn't excuse the lack of communication. The author has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation if it's their financial responsibility now.\n\nBut maybe the author's parents took responsibility in the sense that they told the neighbors not to worry about it, implying they'd cover it. That could shift the blame to the author's parents for not handling it properly. However, the author is the car owner, so the parents aren't legally liable unless they were the ones who agreed to pay. If the parents said not to worry about it, they might have taken on that responsibility, but the author is now dealing with the aftermath.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's about accountability. The kid caused damage, so the family should be responsible. If the parents were informed and agreed to pay but didn't, the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. The neighbors' dismissal of the author's request could be because they feel the author's parents already took care of it, but that's not the case here. The author isn't the one who said to forget it; they were just informed after the fact.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what they're owed for a damage caused by someone else. The neighbors and their parents might have made a mistake in not informing the actual owner or not following through with the payment. The author's frustration is valid because they're now facing unexpected costs, and they're not the one who caused the damage. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
