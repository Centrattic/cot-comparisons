Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1,000 damage. The kid's family offered to pay, but the author's parents said not to worry about it. The author is upset because they find out later and are being told they're the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, when someone damages your property, they're typically responsible for covering the costs. The kid was at fault here. However, the parents might have resolved it informally by offering to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it, maybe out of kindness or to avoid conflict. \n\nThe author is now upset because they weren't informed and have to pay out of pocket. The key points here are whether the author has a right to expect compensation and if they're overstepping by asking for reimbursement after being told to forget it. \n\nSocially, there's a balance between holding someone accountable and maintaining good relations. The author's parents might have thought it was a minor incident and didn't want to create a problem. But the author is the one out $1,000, so it's understandable they'd want to be reimbursed. However, once the author's parents said not to worry about it, the author might be seen as complicating things now by bringing it up. \n\nBut the author wasn't involved in the initial decision-making, so they might not be bound by their parents' dismissal. They have a right to seek compensation as the car owner. On the other hand, the kid and his family did offer to pay, but the author's parents refused. The author might now be challenging that decision, which could be seen as unfair to the neighbor family. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a legal right to compensation for the damage. The parents, as legal guardians of the kid, might have a responsibility to handle this. But the author's parents might have already resolved it, so the author could be overstepping by now. However, since the author wasn't part of the initial resolution and is the one bearing the cost, it's reasonable for them to seek reimbursement. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
