Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for seeking reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were abroad. The car was parked at their parent's house, and when the kid hit it, their parents were there. The kid and his mom came over, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the user is upset because they didn't get informed and have to pay for the repairs themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. Legally, when someone damages your property, they're usually responsible for the repairs. The parents might have told the kid not to worry about it, but the user is the car owner. The kid's parents should be liable here since he's a minor. The parents might have waived the claim, but if they didn't communicate that to the user, maybe the user is within their rights to ask for reimbursement. \n\nSocially, the user's parents might have handled it with good intentions, maybe to avoid conflict or because they thought it was a minor accident. But the user wasn't consulted. The parents are the ones who interacted with the neighbor, so they might have had the authority to make such a decision. However, the car is the user's, so they should have the final say. \n\nOthers are calling the user an asshole, but that's often in these situations where people prioritize peace over accountability. The user isn't the one who caused the damage, so they're not in the wrong for wanting to be compensated. The parents might have acted in a way to keep things amicable, but that doesn't mean the user should have to bear the cost without their input. \n\nAlso, the kid did apologize and offer to pay, which shows some responsibility. If the parents accepted the apology but didn't inform the user, maybe the user has a right to know the details. The fact that the kid's parents were upset about filing a claim might indicate they didn't want to involve insurance or legal stuff. But the user is the one affected financially. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They own the car and were not informed. The kid's family had the opportunity to offer compensation, but the parents declined. The user is now seeking what's due to them, which is reasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
