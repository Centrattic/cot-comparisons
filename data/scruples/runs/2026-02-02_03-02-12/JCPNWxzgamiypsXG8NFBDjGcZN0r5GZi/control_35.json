Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his parents. The kid offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now, the author comes back to find damage and wants reimbursement, but everyone says he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. In many places, if someone damages someone else's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid hit the car, so he's at fault. But he's a minor, so his parents might be liable. The fact that he offered to pay shows some accountability, but the author's parents dismissed it. However, the author wasn't there to handle it.\n\nThe parents' role is tricky. They were acting as the car's custodians, so they have a right to address the issue. By telling the kid's parents not to worry about it, they might have waived any claim. But the author, as the owner, has a right to seek compensation. There's a conflict here between the parents' decision and the author's right to reimbursement.\n\nMoral aspect: The author is upset because he's out $1000. The kid didn't inform him, which is part of the problem. But the author's parents made a decision that might have been well-intentioned but now is causing a conflict. The neighbors might feel they were absolved of responsibility.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's not the one who caused the damage. He's seeking compensation, which is reasonable. However, his parents' actions might have complicated things. If they accepted the apology and dismissed compensation, maybe he can't now come back and demand it. But legally, the responsibility should be on the person who caused the damage, not the parents of the owner. So maybe he's not wrong, but the situation is complicated by his parents' actions.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main fault is the kid's, but the parents' acceptance might have muddied the waters. The answer is B (No).\n"
