Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and everyone's telling them they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The car was parked at the parents' house when the author was away. The neighbor's kid hit it, and the kid and his mom went to the parents. The parents said not to worry, but the kid offered to pay. Now the author is returning and finds out about the damage. They want reimbursement, but their parents and others think they're overreacting.\n\nLegally, if a minor causes damage, the parents are usually responsible. The kid offered to pay, but the parents declined. So maybe the author has a right to seek compensation since the parents didn't take it. But the parents might have decided to handle it themselves. However, the author is the car's owner, so they have the right to decide what happens with their property. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the author. \n\nMoral standpoint: The kid is at fault for the damage. The parents of the kid might be at fault for not ensuring reimbursement. The original owner (the author) is just seeking what's owed. The parents may have made a decision without considering the financial impact on the author. \n\nEveryone saying the author is the asshole might be because they expected the parents to handle it, but the author has a legitimate claim here. The key points are that the damage was done to the author's property, they weren't informed, and there's a financial loss. The parents' decision to let it go doesn't absolve the responsible party. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to get reimbursed. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
