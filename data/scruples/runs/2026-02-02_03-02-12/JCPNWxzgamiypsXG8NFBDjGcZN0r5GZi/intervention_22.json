Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The author's parents were present and told the kid and his mom not to worry about it. Now the author wants reimbursement for $1,000 in damages, but others are saying he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if someone causes damage to your property, they are legally responsible. Even if the car owner was away, the person who caused the damage should still be liable. The fact that the kid is a minor might mean his parents are responsible since they're his guardians. However, the parents might argue that the author's parents already handled it by saying not to worry about it. But does that absolve the other party of legal responsibility? Maybe not, especially if the author's parents didn't actually have the authority to forgive the debt on the author's behalf.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is asking for compensation for damages they didn't know about. They had no say in what their parents decided. It's their car, so they have the right to seek reimbursement, right? The parents might have intended to let it go, but the author is now facing unexpected costs. Is it fair for the parents to have made that decision without consulting the author?\n\nAlso, the kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents said not to worry. But the author's parents might not have the authority to waive the author's rights. So the author's demand for reimbursement isn't unreasonable. The fact that the damage wasn't reported to the author is another point. If they knew about it, they should have informed the author, especially since the author is the owner of the car.\n\nBut some might argue that the author's parents were trying to be kind and prevent conflict. However, that doesn't mean the author isn't entitled to compensation. The author is in a tough spot because they didn't cause the damage and now have to pay for it.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what's rightfully theirs. The other side might have thought they were resolving the issue, but the author's rights as the car owner should take precedence. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
