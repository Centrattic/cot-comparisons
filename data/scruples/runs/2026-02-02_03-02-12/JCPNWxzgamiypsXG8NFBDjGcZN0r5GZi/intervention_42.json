Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The key points here are: the kid and his parents were informed, they apologized and offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it and advised not to take action. Now the author is upset about the lack of reimbursement and is being called the asshole for asking for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal implications. In most places, when someone causes damage to another's property, they are legally responsible for compensation. Even if the owner wasn't present, the person who caused the damage is still liable. The fact that the kid's parents were aware and offered to pay suggests they acknowledge responsibility. However, the author's parents accepted the apology and let it go, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author is upset because they weren't informed and now have to bear the cost. Their parents chose not to pursue reimbursement, possibly due to good relations with the neighbors. But the author feels wronged because they're now out $1,000. The neighbors might see the author as overreacting because the initial issue was handled by their parents. \n\nEthically, the author is within their rights to seek compensation. The damage was done to their property without their knowledge, and the responsible party (the kid) should cover the costs. However, since the author's parents already resolved the matter by accepting an apology and not demanding payment, there might be a social obligation to respect their decision. \n\nLegally, the author might have a case, but socially, they might be seen as the asshole for going back on what their parents agreed to. The neighbors might argue that the issue was settled, and the author is causing more conflict by seeking payment now. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, they might not be. But socially, they could be seen as not respecting their parents' decision to let it go, which might lead others to think they're the asshole. However, the author has a valid point about being out of pocket. This is a tricky situation where legal and social expectations clash. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have let their parents' decision stand or if they're justified in seeking compensation regardless.\n"
