Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The parents told the kid's parents not to worry about it, but the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and ethical aspects here. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are responsible for the damages. But since the parents were there, they might have handled it, and the author wasn't informed. The parents might have given permission not to pursue compensation, which could release the other party from liability. But the author is the actual owner, so maybe the parents shouldn't have decided that without consulting them.\n\nAlso, the kid is a minor, so his parents are legally responsible. If the author's parents accepted the apology and told them not to worry, maybe that's a release of liability. However, the author is now out of pocket because their parents didn't follow through. The author might feel wronged because they didn't have a say. \n\nBut is the author at fault? If the kid and his family were told not to worry about it by the parents, then maybe the author's parents waived their right to compensation. However, the author is the owner, so the parents might not have the authority to do that. But in some cases, the car was at their parents' house, so maybe there's an argument that the damage occurred on their property, and they handled it. \n\nThe key points are: the parents decided to let it go, the author didn't know, and now they're out money. Legally, if the parents (as the car's custodians) accepted the apology and didn't require payment, maybe they can't be reimbursed. But ethically, the author might feel they should be compensated since they're the owner. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The parents might have acted without consulting the owner. The kid's family should have ensured the actual owner was aware and that compensation was arranged. Since the parents dismissed it, but the author is the one who ends up paying, the author isn't the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
