Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and has to pay for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In most places, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for compensating you. The kid is 16, so maybe his parents are liable. However, the parents might argue that they resolved the issue with the car's owner (the author's parents), so maybe there's a lack of knowledge on the author's part. But the car's owner is the author, not his parents. So did the parents have the authority to waive the claim? Probably not. The author is the legal owner, so the parents might have overstepped by dismissing the compensation.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is being told he's the asshole for seeking reimbursement. But he's asking for something he's owed. The kid did cause damage, and the parents of the kid said they were upset about being asked for compensation. But the original owner isn't the parents\u2014they are just temporary caretakers. The author didn't know about the damage until he returned, which adds to the frustration.\n\nPossible issues to check: Did the parents of the kid have insurance? If they do, maybe they can file a claim through insurance. But the author is asking directly for reimbursement. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the author's parents said not to worry about it complicates things. However, the author's parents might not have the authority to forgive the debt on his behalf.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the kid and his parents might be at fault for not informing the actual owner and not compensating him. The author is within his rights to seek reimbursement. The people telling him he's the asshole are wrong because he's not the one who caused the damage. The parents' actions might have been misguided, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be compensated. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
