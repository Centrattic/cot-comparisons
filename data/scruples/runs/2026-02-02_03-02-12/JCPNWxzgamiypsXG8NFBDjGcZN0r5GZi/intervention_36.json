Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, and the parents were told but didn't inform the author. Now the author is upset about the $1,000 damage and wants reimbursement, but everyone else thinks they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. So the kid's parents should cover the cost. However, the author's parents were present and let it slide, maybe out of kindness or to avoid conflict. But did they have the right to do that without consulting the car owner?\n\nMorally, the author isn't at fault for the accident itself. They weren't there, and the damage was done to their property. The fact that their parents didn't inform them is a problem. They have every right to be upset about the financial loss. The kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. So the author is seeking compensation, which is reasonable.\n\nBut why are people saying the author is the asshole? Maybe because they think the parents handled it, or that the author should just accept the apology. However, the author's parents might not have the authority to waive the claim on the author's behalf. The author is the owner of the car, so they have the right to pursue reimbursement.\n\nAnother angle: the kid's family might have made a good-faith effort to resolve it by apologizing and offering payment, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author is now seeking what's rightfully theirs. It's possible that the author's parents were trying to be generous, but that doesn't absolve the responsible party of their obligation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's parents should have ensured the car owner was informed and that compensation was arranged. Since the author's parents didn't do that, maybe they acted inconsiderately. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so they can't be blamed for seeking reimbursement.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) Ownership of the car lies with the author, so they decide what happens. 2) The responsible party (kid's parents) should cover the damages. 3) The author's parents didn't inform them, which is part of the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting compensation. The answer should be B.\n"
