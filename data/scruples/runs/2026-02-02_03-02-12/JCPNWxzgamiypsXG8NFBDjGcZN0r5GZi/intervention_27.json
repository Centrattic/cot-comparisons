Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 damage. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author found out upon returning and is upset about the lack of reimbursement. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. Let's break it down. The car was parked at the author's parents' house, so the parents were the ones present when the accident happened. The kid and his parents approached the parents, the kid apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author wasn't there and wasn't informed. Now the author is angry because he has to pay for the damage and feels like he's being blamed for overreacting.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if a minor causes damage, the parents are typically responsible. But in this case, the kid offered to pay, and the parents might have let it slide. However, the parents (the author's parents) might have been the ones who allowed the situation to be swept under the rug. The author's parents might have made a decision that the author isn't happy with. \n\nThe author's main points are: 1) Not being informed about the accident, and 2) Not getting compensation. The author's parents might have a reason to not press charges, maybe they didn't want to burden the kid or his family, or maybe they didn't know the extent of the damage. But the author is the one who has to deal with the financial burden. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the parents were the ones who said not to worry about it, the author might not be at fault for expecting reimbursement. The kid did cause the damage, and the parents (the author's) allowed the matter to be unresolved. The author isn't the one who caused the accident, so he shouldn't be responsible for the damage. However, the parents might have made that decision, so the author could be seen as overstepping if he's now trying to get reimbursement after the fact. But the author says that nobody told him, so he wasn't aware. If the parents didn't inform him, maybe they were wrong for not telling him. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the author have a right to expect reimbursement? The kid was at fault, but the parents (the author's) didn't pursue it. The author is now upset about the financial loss. If the parents made a decision, the author might not be in the wrong for being upset, because he wasn't part of that decision. The author's parents might be the ones in the wrong for not informing him or not taking action. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parents were acting on behalf of the author (since the car is his), then maybe they should have considered his wishes. But since the author was abroad, maybe the parents thought they could handle it. But the author is the owner, so the parents might not have the authority to waive the claim without his consent. \n\nIn that case, the author's parents might be in the wrong for not informing him, and the author is justified in wanting compensation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B.\n"
