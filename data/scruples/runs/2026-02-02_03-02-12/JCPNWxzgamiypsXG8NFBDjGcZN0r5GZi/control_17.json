There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong because a neighbor's 16-year-old kid damaged their parked car while they were abroad, and when they asked for reimbursement, everyone told them they're the asshole for doing so. \n\nFirst, the car was parked across the street at their parents' house. The kid hit it, and the kid's parents and the neighbor kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now, the user is upset because they didn't get informed and have to pay for the damage.\n\nSo, legally, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for the damages, right? Even if the owner isn't present. The parents might have accepted the apology and let the kid off the hook, but the original owner (the user) has the right to seek compensation for their car, which is their property. \n\nBut the user wasn't there. Their parents, being the ones who saw the damage and spoke to the neighbors, might have the authority to handle it, but maybe they didn't realize the full extent of the damage or the user's financial situation. The user mentions they were working remotely to afford a visa, which suggests they might be in a tight financial spot. \n\nThe neighbors, especially the kid's parents, might have felt that the user's parents had already let it go, so they didn't have to pay again. But the user's parents are separate from the user's own responsibilities. The user's right to reimbursement isn't negated by their parents' decision to let it slide. \n\nHowever, the user is asking for money after the fact when the immediate responsibility was handled by their parents. That could be seen as an afterthought or maybe the parents didn't communicate properly. But the user is still the car owner and is justified in wanting their expenses covered. \n\nOn Reddit, people often consider intent and communication. The kid didn't inform the user, which is a problem. The parents might have thought the user wouldn't mind because they're family, but that doesn't mean the user isn't allowed to expect reimbursement. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation for damages caused to their property. The neighbors (the kid and his parents) are responsible, but the user's parents might have already resolved it. However, since the user is the one who has to pay out of pocket, they have a valid claim. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
