Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user was in Germany for three months and left their car parked at their parents' house. A 16-year-old neighbor backed into the front of the car, causing around $1,000 in damages. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house to address it. The parents told them not to worry, even though the kid offered to pay. The user came back, found out about the damage, and is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. Now, they're being told to forget it and that they're overreacting. The main points are: the kid caused damage, the parents were approached but dismissed the issue, and the user is now seeking reimbursement but others say they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal perspective. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are responsible for covering the costs. However, the user's parents handled the situation by not informing them and not pursuing compensation. Legally, the owner of the car (the user) has the right to seek reimbursement, but since they were away, their parents might have the authority to handle it on their behalf. But if the parents decided not to ask for compensation, does the user have any legal recourse? It might depend on local laws, but generally, the car's owner is entitled to compensation for damages caused by others.\n\nNext, the ethical side. Even if the parents let it go, the user isn't the one who caused the damage. They were away and had no control over the situation. The kid's family was informed about the damage, and the kid offered to pay, but the user's parents declined. The user is now upset about the financial burden. The kid's family might feel that the parents took care of it, but the user's parents might not have considered the user's position when they were abroad. Ethically, is it fair for the user to expect compensation? It seems so, as they bear the cost. However, the user's parents might have thought it was a minor incident or didn't want to burden the kid's family, but that doesn't negate the user's right to be compensated.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The user is asking for reimbursement, but others are saying they're the asshole. This could be due to cultural norms where people might downplay such incidents, especially involving minors. Maybe the community expects the user to accept the apology and move on, even if it's a financial burden. But the user is in a position where they have to pay the $1,000, which is a significant amount, especially if they're working remotely for a visa. The kid's family might have moved on, but the user is left to deal with the consequences.\n\nThe user's parents' role is also a factor. They were the ones approached by the neighbor, and they chose to not inform their child. This might be seen as an oversight. If they had informed the user, maybe the situation could have been resolved differently. Now, the user is caught in the middle, being blamed for asking for money after the fact. However, the parents might not have realized that the user would return and need to know about the damage. \n\nAnother point is that the kid, being 16, might not be fully responsible, but his parents are typically the ones who would cover for a minor's actions. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was dismissed by the user's parents might mean that the opportunity to settle the matter was missed. The user is now trying to address it after the fact, which could be perceived as holding a grudge or being inconsiderate, but if the damage wasn't their fault, maybe that's not the case.\n\nI should also consider if there's any evidence. The user didn't mention any, like pictures, witness statements, or police reports. If there's no proof, it might be harder to enforce reimbursement, but that doesn't mean they're wrong to ask. If the parents thought it was a minor issue, maybe they didn't document it, which is a problem now.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the user has a right to be compensated for damages caused by someone else. The parents, as temporary custodians, might have the authority to accept or reject compensation, but in this case, they rejected it without the user's consent. The user is left to deal with the financial burden they didn't cause. Ethically and morally, the kid's family should have informed the car owner and compensated them. The user isn't at fault for the accident, and it's reasonable to seek reimbursement. However, the parents' dismissal might be complicating things. The user is not the asshole for wanting to be reimbursed after the fact, especially if they were unaware of the incident. Others' judgment that the user is overreacting could stem from a desire to avoid conflict or a lack of understanding of the financial impact. Therefore, the answer would be that the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
