Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid's parents visited the author's parents to deal with it, but the parents just let it slide. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. People are saying the author is the asshole, but they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The car was parked at the parents' house, which the author left while in Germany. The neighbor's kid hit it, and after the accident, the kid and his mom went to the parents' house. The kid offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry. So the author comes back and finds out about the damage without being informed and is expected to just accept it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, if someone's property is damaged by another, especially a minor, the responsible party (or their guardians) are usually liable for compensation. Since the kid is 16, his parents are legally responsible. If the parents were informed and the kid offered to pay but they declined, that might affect the legal liability, but ethically, maybe the parents should have informed the car's owner (the author) regardless of their decision to waive reimbursement.\n\nEthically, the author's parents had a duty to inform the author about the damage, especially since they weren't the legal owners of the car. The parents might have thought they were being kind by not making a big deal, but withholding such significant information (which costs $1k) could be seen as neglecting their responsibility. The author is the rightful owner and should have the right to decide whether to accept reimbursement or let it go.\n\nAnother point is that the author was abroad, so they couldn't have known about the incident unless informed. The neighbors knew about the damage and even discussed it with the parents, so they had a responsibility to inform the owner. The author's reaction is understandable because they're now facing the financial burden without prior knowledge.\n\nThe people saying the author is the asshole might be arguing that the parents handled it and the kid apologized, so the author should let it go. But from the author's perspective, they were not involved in the decision and are now stuck with the costs. The author isn't overreacting to the damage itself but to the lack of communication and not being given a choice in the matter.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents didn't inform them, the kid's family didn't compensate them, and the author is within their rights to seek reimbursement. The real issue is the failure to communicate rather than the act of seeking compensation.\n"
