Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents of the kid were there and the kid offered to pay, but the author's parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1k for repairs and no one told them. The community is split, with others saying the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are responsible for covering the costs. Even if the owner isn't present, the person causing the damage should notify the owner. The kid here hit the car and then supposedly apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were against filing a claim. However, the author's parents might have been too lenient, not considering that the damage wasn't their own.\n\nEthically, the author is in a tough spot. They didn't cause the damage, and the person responsible (the kid) should be held accountable. The parents of the kid might be shielding them from consequences, which isn't fair to the author. Also, the fact that the author didn't know about the damage until returning is a problem because they couldn't take immediate action, like getting an estimate or preventing further issues.\n\nLegally, if the kid is a minor, the parents are usually liable. The parents might have a responsibility to cover the costs. But since the author's parents didn't pursue it, maybe there's a cultural or personal reason. However, the author is now the one facing the financial burden without prior knowledge. It's reasonable for them to seek compensation, especially since they weren't there to handle it themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author's parents thought it was a minor incident and didn't want to involve the police or insurance. But that doesn't negate the fact that the author has to pay. The neighbors might not be in the wrong if they resolved it with the author's parents, but the author's right to be informed and compensated still stands.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're entitled to seek reimbursement for damages caused by someone else. The neighbors not informing them and the parents dismissing it could be seen as negligent. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
