Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car when they were abroad. The parents of the kid were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The car owner came back to find the damage and is upset about not being informed and not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they are liable for the damages. The kid is a minor, so the parents would be responsible. The fact that the kid and parents went to the parents' house and discussed the situation suggests there was an acknowledgment of fault. The parents might have waived the responsibility, but does that absolve them legally?\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The car owner wasn't informed, which is a key point. The parents might have downplayed the situation, but the owner wasn't consulted. The user is frustrated because they had to cover the costs. Is it reasonable for them to seek reimbursement after the fact?\n\nAlso, the parents and others are telling the author to \"forget it,\" but that doesn't mean the financial loss is gone. The user isn't the one at fault for the accident, so demanding compensation isn't unreasonable. However, if the parents already resolved it with the neighbor, maybe the user is overstepping by bringing it up now.\n\nWait, but the user wasn't even there. Their parents might have been in a position to handle it, but they didn't inform the user. That's a problem. The user is the rightful owner of the car, so they should have the right to decide whether to seek compensation. If the parents dismissed it without the owner's input, that's an issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The neighbor's family might be responsible, and the user's parents shouldn't have made that decision without them. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
