Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1000 damage. The parents were present when the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get compensation.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility: when someone damages another's property, they're usually liable. The kid is 16, so maybe the parents are responsible as guardians. But in this case, the kid's family was approached, and the parents might have resolved it with the author's parents. However, the author's parents didn't inform them. \n\nMoral responsibility: The kid caused damage and offered to pay, but the parents here (both the neighbor and the author's) seem to have dismissed it. The author's parents didn't inform their child about the damage, which is a problem. The author is now being blamed for asking for reimbursement, but they weren't part of the initial conversation.\n\nKey points: The neighbor's parents and the kid were involved, but the author's parents didn't communicate the incident. The author is being accused of being the asshole for wanting compensation. Legally, the responsible party should cover the damage. Since the author's parents didn't inform them, maybe the author isn't at fault. But if the parents resolved it, maybe the author is overstepping now. But the author didn't know, so they have a right to seek compensation. The neighbor's family might be in the wrong for not informing and not compensating. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
