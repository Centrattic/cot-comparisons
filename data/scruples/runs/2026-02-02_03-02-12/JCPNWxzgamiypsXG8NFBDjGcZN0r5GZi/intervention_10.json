Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a neighbor's 16-year-old kid damaging the author's parked car while the author was away. The parents were present and spoke with the kid and his mom, but the author wasn't informed. Now the author is upset about not being reimbursed and is being told to just accept it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal aspects. In most places, when a minor causes damage, their parents can be held responsible. The kid offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed the compensation. However, the author is the rightful owner of the car, so even if the parents tried to handle it, they might not have the authority to waive the claim. The parents might have resolved it without consulting the owner, which could be an issue.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The kid made a mistake, apologized, and offered to pay. The parents of the kid and the author's parents might have thought it's best to let it go, but the author is now out $1,000. The key points are whether the author is overstepping by seeking reimbursement after being told not to worry about it, and if the parents had the right to make that decision without the owner's consent.\n\nLegally, the author might have a case to claim damages because the kid was at fault. The parents dismissing the claim might not hold up if the author pursues it. However, if the author's parents accepted the apology and refused compensation, maybe there's an argument that the issue was resolved. But since the car belongs to the author, they have the right to seek compensation. \n\nMoral judgments can vary. Some might say the author is reasonable to seek compensation for their loss, while others might think it's a minor issue that shouldn't strain relationships. The fact that the author wasn't informed adds to the frustration. The kid not informing the owner directly could be seen as a mistake, but the parents might have tried to handle it.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is likely not in the wrong. They have a right to be informed and to seek reimbursement. The parents' decision might not have considered the author's perspective, so the author is justified in being upset. Answering B makes sense here.\n"
