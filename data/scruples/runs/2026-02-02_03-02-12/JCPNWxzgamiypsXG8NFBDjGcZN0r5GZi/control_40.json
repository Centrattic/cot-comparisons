Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, who offered to pay. But the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and want reimbursement. Everyone around them thinks they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are: the kid caused damage, the parents were present and handled the situation, but didn't inform the car owner (the author). The parents and the kid's family might have resolved it by saying it's okay, but the author wasn't consulted. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, when someone's property is damaged, the owner has the right to seek compensation. The parents might have the authority to accept a settlement, but the car owner (the author) is the one who suffered the loss. If the parents accepted the apology and waived the claim without consulting the author, that could be a problem. The author is now being blamed for asking for reimbursement, but they have a valid reason to want compensation for their damage.\n\nMoral aspects: It's not the author's fault the kid hit the car. They were away, and their parents handled the situation without their input. The fact that the kid offered to pay and the parents dismissed it might be the issue. The author is now being told to just forget it, but they have a right to expect that their property damage is addressed. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The kid and his family should compensate for the damage, and the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. The people around them being judgmental is misplaced. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
