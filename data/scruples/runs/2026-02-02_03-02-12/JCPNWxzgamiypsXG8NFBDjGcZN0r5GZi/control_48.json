Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents of the kid went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get informed and there's no reimbursement.\n\nFirst, the kid caused damage. In most places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for fixing it. Since the kid is a minor, his parents would typically be liable. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents dismissed it might be the problem here. The author's parents might have resolved it without consulting the car owner, which the author wasn't informed about.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and communication. The kid and his parents had a duty to inform the actual car owner, especially since the author was away. The parents of the kid might have made a unilateral decision not to reimburse, which isn't the author's fault. The author is trying to get compensation for their own property, which is reasonable. \n\nThe people telling the author to \"forget it\" might be focusing on the kid's apology and the parents' dismissal, but the author's right to compensation isn't negated by their absence. The fact that the kid didn't inform the owner directly is also an issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what's rightfully theirs. The answer should be B.\n"
