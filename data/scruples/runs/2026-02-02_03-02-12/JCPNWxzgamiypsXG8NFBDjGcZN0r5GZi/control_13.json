Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted about their car being damaged by a neighbor's kid is in the wrong. The situation is that the kid hit the car while the owner was abroad. The parents of the neighbor were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents were against filing a claim. The owner now wants reimbursement but everyone is telling him he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and social aspects here. Legally, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for the damages. The neighbor's kid caused the damage, so the parents might be liable since the kid is a minor. But the parents were present and involved. They were upset about filing a claim and the parents of the car owner agreed not to pursue it. However, the car owner was not present and the damage was done without their knowledge. \n\nThe author didn't know about the damage for two days and wasn't informed. They were abroad, so maybe they can't be blamed for not knowing. The neighbor's family might have a responsibility to inform the car owner even if the parents of the car owner told them not to worry. If the parents said not to worry, but the car owner is now seeking reimbursement, there's a conflict in communications.\n\nSocially, it's about expectations. The kid took responsibility by offering to pay, but the parents didn't follow through. The parents of the car owner let it slide, but the owner is now upset because he wasn't informed. The neighbors didn't inform him, which is a problem. The parents of the car owner might have overstepped by not involving the owner in the decision to waive the claim. The author is being told it's not a big deal, but he's the one who has to pay for the repairs. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the neighbor's family should have informed the car owner and possibly covered the costs. The author isn't at fault for seeking reimbursement. The people telling him he's the asshole might be overlooking the fact that the neighbor's family didn't inform him and are avoiding responsibility. The author is in the right to want compensation for damages caused by someone else. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
