Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present when the incident happened and told them not to worry about it, so the parents didn't inform the author and no reimbursement was arranged. Now the author is upset and being told they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. The parents were there and might have agreed to liability, either through insurance or personal responsibility. The parents told the kid not to worry about it, so maybe they thought they were handling it. But the author is the actual car owner, so they have the right to seek compensation. The parents didn't inform the owner, which is a problem because the owner wasn't part of that agreement.\n\nEthically, the parents might have assumed they were covering it, but the author has a right to know about damages to their property. The kid's family might be responsible for the repairs, especially since they were aware of the incident. The fact that the author is now being told to accept no compensation by their parents and others might be because they don't want a conflict, but that doesn't mean the author isn't justified in seeking reimbursement.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The parents were the ones who interacted with the car's owner (the author's parents) and made the decision to not inform the actual owner. 2) The author is now facing unexpected costs. 3) The legal responsibility falls on the parents of the kid since he's a minor. \n\nSo, if the parents of the kid were the ones who agreed to the situation, maybe they should have informed the author. The author isn't at fault for seeking what's legally their right. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
