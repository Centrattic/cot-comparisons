Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid damaging their car while they were away, and the parents didn't inform them or seek reimbursement.\n\nFirst, the kid hit the car and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. The author now feels wronged because they didn't know and there's no compensation. The key points here are: the damage was done, the kid and parents were made aware, but the parents chose not to inform the author or pursue compensation. \n\nLegally, if someone's property is damaged, they have the right to seek compensation. However, since the author's parents initially handled the situation and said not to worry, there's a question about whether the author is now out of line by changing their stance. But wait, the parents didn't own the car; the author did. So maybe the parents were overstepping by forgiving the debt without consulting the car owner.\n\nAlso, the kid was 16, so a minor, which might affect liability. Typically, parents are responsible for their minor children's damages. So if the kid caused the damage, the parents should cover it. But in this case, the parents tried to dismiss the issue. \n\nThe author is upset because they didn't know and now are left with the cost. They're not the one who caused the damage, so logically, they should be the ones seeking compensation. However, if the parents already resolved it, maybe the author is complicating things. But the author's parents didn't have the authority to forgive the debt since the car isn't theirs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be informed about damage to their property and to seek reimbursement. The parents might be at fault for not telling them, but the author is justified in wanting compensation now. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
