Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1,000 in damages and no one told them. The author is being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal responsibilities here. When someone causes damage to another person's property, they are generally liable for the costs. In this case, the kid is 16, so under most jurisdictions, the parents would be legally responsible for their child's actions as they are minors. The parents were present when the incident happened and were offered to pay by the kid, but they declined. However, the owner of the car wasn't informed, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The damage was done without the owner's knowledge. 2) The parents were present and chose not to inform the owner. 3) The author is now being asked to bear the cost because the parents are dismissing it as \"these things happen.\"\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has a right to seek compensation for the damage caused to their property. The fact that the parents didn't inform them doesn't absolve the responsible party of liability. The parents' decision to not involve the owner might have been out of good intentions to avoid conflict, but that doesn't mean the damage is the author's burden to bear. \n\nThe author isn't overreacting to be responsible for the damage they didn't cause. The neighbor's family had the opportunity to address the issue but didn't, and now the author is left with the financial responsibility. The author didn't ask for anything unreasonable; they want reimbursement for the damages. \n\nHowever, there's a social aspect too. The parents might have thought it was a minor incident or wanted to avoid involving the police or insurance, which can be stressful. But from the author's perspective, they didn't have a say in that decision and are now facing the financial hit. \n\nIn many places, if someone's property is damaged, the owner has the right to pursue compensation. The fact that the parents were there and the kid offered to pay means there's acknowledgment of fault. The parents' refusal to compensate doesn't change the fact that the damage was done by someone else. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. They are the rightful owner of the car, and it's reasonable for them to expect that the party responsible for the damage (the kid, through their parents) should cover the costs. The author's reaction is justified because they weren't part of the initial decision to let it go and are now shouldering the financial burden. The neighbors' dismissal of the situation as just an accident that should be forgotten is where the fault lies, not the author's request for compensation.\n"
