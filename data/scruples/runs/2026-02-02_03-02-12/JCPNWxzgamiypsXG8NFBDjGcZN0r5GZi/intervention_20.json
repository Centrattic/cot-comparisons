Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and let the kid off without reimbursement. Now the author is upset about the $1,000 damage and wants the kid to pay, but everyone else is saying they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal responsibility. If the kid caused the damage, he's liable, right? Even if he's a minor, the parents might be responsible for covering the costs. The parents told the kid not to worry about it, which might have been their choice, but the author has a right to seek compensation, regardless of what the parents decided. \n\nBut wait, the author wasn't there. The parents were the ones who interacted with the kid. They might have felt responsible to handle it themselves, but maybe they didn't realize the full extent of the damage or didn't want to burden the kid. The author is now back and finding out about the damage. It's understandable to be upset because they have to pay for something that wasn't their fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have thought it was a minor incident, or maybe the kid offered to pay but the parents waved it off. The author might be in a bind here because they weren't there to negotiate. But legally, the person who caused the damage should pay. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. \n\nThe neighbors might be upset because the author is bringing up the issue now, but the damage was done. The author's parents might have thought they could handle it, but they didn't consider the financial burden on the author. So the author is justified in wanting compensation. \n\nI think the key points are: liability for damages, the parents' role in the situation, and the author's right to be reimbursed for their property. The author isn't in the wrong for asking for reimbursement. The answer should be B.\n"
