Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad. The parents were present and talked to the kid and his mom, but no one informed the author. Now he's upset about not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone causes damage to your property, they're generally liable to pay for it. The kid is 16, so his parents might be legally responsible as guardians. The parents were there at the scene, and the kid offered to pay, but the author's parents told them not to worry. But since the author is the car owner, they have the right to seek compensation. Even if the parents tried to handle it, they didn't have the authority to waive that right. The author's parents might have been trying to be nice, but they shouldn't have taken away the author's option to get reimbursement.\n\nThen there's the issue of not being informed. The author wasn't told about the accident until returning home. That's a problem because they had no chance to address it while they were away. The neighbor's parents might have known but didn't inform the owner, which is inconsiderate. The author has a right to know about damage to their property, especially when they're not there.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's family's reaction to not wanting a police report or insurance claim complicates things. If they didn't file a report, it might be harder to get compensation, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay suggests they acknowledge fault, so the author should be able to accept that payment.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents thought the damage wasn't serious or that it was better to let it go. But the author is now facing a $1000 expense. It's not unreasonable for them to want compensation. The key points are liability, right to be informed, and the right to seek reimbursement. Since the author's parents didn't inform them and also dismissed the issue, the author is justified in being upset. They aren't the asshole for wanting their car fixed without paying for someone else's mistake.\n"
