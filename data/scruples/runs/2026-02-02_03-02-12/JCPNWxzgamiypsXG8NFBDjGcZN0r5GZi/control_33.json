Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke with the kid and his mom. The kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. The author came back to find the damage and wants reimbursement. Others are telling him he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. Generally, when someone causes damage to another's property, they're liable for repairs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be responsible as guardians. The parents were present and the kid offered to pay, but the author's parents declined. However, the author wasn't consulted. Legally, the parents might have the authority to accept or decline compensation, but if they declined, maybe the author still has a claim. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The kid admitted fault and offered to pay, but the author's parents waved it off. The neighbor's parents might have been trying to avoid conflict, but that doesn't absolve them of liability. The author is upset because he's the one who has to pay for the damage. From his point of view, he's not at fault. But others might think that since his parents already handled it, he's overstepping by asking later. \n\nAlso, the kid might not have the funds, and the parents might be in a position where they can't afford to pay. But legally, they might still be responsible. The key points are whether the author's parents had the authority to waive his right to reimbursement. If the car is his, he might still be entitled to compensation even if his parents said not to worry. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't wrong for seeking what he's owed. The kid and his parents are at fault for causing damage and not compensating. The author's parents might have acted without his consent, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
