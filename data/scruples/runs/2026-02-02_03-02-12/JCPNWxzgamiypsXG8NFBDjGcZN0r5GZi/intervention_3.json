Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he didn't know about the damage and isn't getting reimbursed. Everyone says he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The car was parked at the author's parents' house, so maybe the parents were acting on his behalf? But the author wasn't there. The kid hit the car, and the parents were involved. The parents told the kid not to worry about it, but the author is now upset because he's the one who has to pay for repairs. \n\nLegally, when someone causes damage to your property, they're usually liable. So if the kid hit the car, he's responsible. But since the author wasn't present, maybe the parents had authority to act on his behalf. However, in some cases, parents might not have the legal authority to forgive a debt unless they're the legal guardian. But in the US, a 16-year-old is a minor, so the parents would be legally responsible. \n\nThe parents of the kid might have agreed not to pay, but the author's parents accepted that. But the author's parents might not have the legal right to waive the claim. So the author's parents might have overstepped by not informing their son and not letting him seek reimbursement. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the kid did damage someone else's property and should compensate. The author is upset because he's the one facing the financial loss. The neighbors and parents might think it's a minor issue, but $1000 is significant. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so he's not the asshole. The kid and their parents are responsible, but the author's parents might have made a mistake by not allowing the author to handle it.\n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The kid is responsible, and the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. The parents acting on their own might have contributed to the problem by not informing the author, but the main issue is the kid's liability.\n"
