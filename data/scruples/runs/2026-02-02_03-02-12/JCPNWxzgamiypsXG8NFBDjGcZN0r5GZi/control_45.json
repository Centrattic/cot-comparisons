Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. When the user came back, they found the damage and are upset about not being informed and not getting compensation. Everyone around them says they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, the kid caused the damage. At 16, he's a minor, so the responsibility usually falls on his parents. The parents went to the user's parents to address it, but the user's parents dismissed it. The user argues that they should be compensated for $1,000 in damages. The key points here are: the parents didn't inform the user, the user's parents didn't handle the situation, and the user is now seeking reimbursement.\n\nLegally, the responsible party is the one who caused the damage. Since the kid is a minor, his parents should cover the costs. The user's parents might have been too lenient, but the user is the rightful owner, so they have the right to seek compensation. The fact that no one told them is a problem because they should have been informed. Everyone saying they're the asshole seems to be dismissing their legitimate claim just because the parents didn't pursue it initially. The user isn't at fault here. They\u2019re standing up for their right to compensation after their property was damaged without their knowledge. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
