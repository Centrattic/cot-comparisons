Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong after their neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away. The author came back to find $1,000 damage and no compensation. They're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author was in Germany for three months. Their car was parked at their parents' house. A 16-year-old neighbor hit the car. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house to address it. The parents said not to worry, the kid apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because no one told them and they have to pay for repairs.\n\nSo, the author's parents decided to let it go, but the author is unhappy. The neighbors might think the author is overreacting because the parents forgave the debt. But the author feels wronged because they have to cover the cost.\n\nLegally, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for repairs. The kid was at fault, so the parents or the kid should cover it. But since the author's parents accepted the apology and said not to worry, maybe they effectively waived the claim. However, the author is now the one who has to pay the repair costs because their parents didn't follow through.\n\nEthically, even if the parents forgave the damage, the author might feel entitled to the reimbursement since they're the car owner. But the parents are the ones who interacted with the neighbors. If they said it's okay, maybe the author shouldn't bring it up later. But does the author have a right to expect their parents to handle such matters appropriately?\n\nThe author's parents might not have considered the financial burden on the author. They might have thought the situation was resolved without knowing the full impact. But the author is now left with unexpected expenses. \n\nSo, the key points are: the parents resolved the issue without consulting the author, the neighbors thought it was settled, and the author is now upset about the financial loss. The author is asking for reimbursement, which the neighbors and parents think was already addressed.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often depends on whether the person acted inconsiderately. Here, the author didn't cause the damage. They came back to a problem they weren't aware of and are seeking compensation. The parents might have made a decision without considering the author's perspective. However, the author should have been informed about the incident. The parents might have missed communicating that they forgave the debt, but the author has a right to know about the damage and any decisions made regarding compensation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're not the one who caused the damage. They're trying to deal with the consequences. The parents might be at fault for not informing them or not ensuring the issue was resolved properly. The author's parents might have handled it inconsiderately. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
