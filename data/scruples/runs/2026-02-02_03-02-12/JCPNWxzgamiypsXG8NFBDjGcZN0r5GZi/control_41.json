Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their car while they were abroad. The parents told the kid's family not to worry about it, but now the owner is upset because he didn't know and isn't getting reimbursed.\n\nFirst, the kid caused damage intentionally or negligently. The parents of the kid were upset about being asked to pay, but the original owner's parents said not to worry. Now the owner feels wronged because he wasn't informed and isn't getting compensation.\n\nThe question is about whether the owner is in the wrong. So, according to the law, if someone's property is damaged, they have the right to seek compensation. The owner wasn't there, so his parents handled it. But they let it go without informing him. The kid's parents might be liable as the child is a minor, so they would be responsible.\n\nBut in the scenario, the owner's own parents said not to worry about it, which might have waived the right to compensation. However, the owner isn't the one who waived it. So maybe the owner is justified in seeking reimbursement because he's the owner of the car. The fact that his parents didn't inform him is a problem, but he's the rightful owner. The neighbors might think he's overreacting because his parents already dismissed the issue, but legally, he could still have a claim.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the owner has the right to seek compensation for damages caused to his property, regardless of what his parents said. The parents might have intended to let it go, but the owner wasn't involved in that decision. The kid's parents should be responsible for the damage caused by their child.\n"
