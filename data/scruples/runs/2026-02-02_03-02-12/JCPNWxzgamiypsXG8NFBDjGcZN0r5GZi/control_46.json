Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, who offered to pay but were told not to worry about it. Now the original owner is upset because no one informed him and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, when someone damages your property, they're responsible for repairs. Even if the owner isn't present, that doesn't absolve the person who caused the damage. The parents might have been there, but they aren't the legal owners, so they can't forgive the debt legally. The kid's parents offering to pay but being told not to worry means the damage wasn't resolved properly.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The owner is being asked to accept that it's okay when someone else's kid causes damage and doesn't compensate them. The parents might have acted out of kindness, but it's not fair to the car owner who ends up with the financial burden. The neighbors didn't inform the owner, which is a problem because transparency is important here. The kid did apologize, but that doesn't cover the financial loss.\n\nAlso, the user mentions they had to work remotely to afford a visa. So this $1k is a significant hit. The neighbors' approach might have been to avoid conflict, but it's not helping the actual owner. The author is in a tough spot because they weren't consulted and now have to pay. The neighbors might have overstepped by deciding not to inform or involve the owner in the resolution.\n\nIn many cases, if you damage someone's property, you should contact the owner and handle the repair costs. Since the car owner wasn't informed, the responsibility still lies with the person who caused the damage. The parents might have thought they were being helpful, but they didn't have the authority to dismiss the claim.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The ones at fault are the kid and his parents for not ensuring the owner was informed and compensated. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
