Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. The user comes back to find $1k damage and is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. Everyone tells them they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are: the kid caused damage, the parents were involved, the author's parents dismissed it, and the author is now seeking compensation. \n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, when someone causes damage to another's property, they are generally liable for repairs. Since the kid is a minor, the parents would be responsible. However, the parents in this case might have resolved the issue without the owner's knowledge. The author's parents, who are the car's legal owners (assuming the car is registered under them), might have the authority to waive any claims. \n\nBut the car belongs to the author, not the parents. So if the parents were just acting as intermediaries, they might not have the right to dismiss the claim. However, if the car is registered under the parents, then they might have the legal standing to handle the matter. The user's parents might have thought they were the car's owners, leading them to say it's okay. The author, as the actual owner, could have a right to pursue compensation. \n\nBut the author's parents did accept the apology and said not to worry. Did they have the authority to do that on behalf of the author? If the author is the registered owner, then the parents might not have the legal right to dismiss the claim. The kid's family might have believed that the matter was resolved because the parents said so, but if the parents weren't the owners, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the neighbor's family might not have known that the author wasn't present. The author's absence was a factor here. The neighbor's parents went to the parent's house, which might be the correct place to address the issue if the car was parked there. But the author's parents might have thought they were handling it on behalf of their son/daughter, not realizing that the author was the actual owner. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that the author is overreacting because the parents already handled it. But others might say that the author has the right to seek compensation since they own the car. The issue is whether the author's parents had the authority to waive the claim. If not, then the author isn't in the wrong. If they did, then the author might be at fault for not knowing the situation.\n\nLegally, the parents might not have the right to dismiss the claim if the car is owned by the author. The neighbor's family might have a good faith belief that the matter was resolved, but if the author is the legal owner, they can still pursue compensation. However, if the parents are the registered owners, then they could have dismissed the claim, making the author's request for reimbursement inappropriate.\n\nSo, the answer depends on who the legal owner of the car is. If the author is the registered owner, then they are not in the wrong. If the parents are the owners, then the author is in the wrong. The post doesn't specify who the car's legal owner is. But given that the user's parents said they are the owners, maybe the car is theirs. If that's the case, the parents can decide not to seek compensation. However, if the car is the author's, then the parents might have overstepped.\n\nIn the Reddit scenario, the user is the one who came back and found out about the damage. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but if the car is the user's, then the parents shouldn't have dismissed the claim without the user's knowledge. The user is justified in seeking compensation in that case. \n\nTherefore, if the car is the author's, they are not in the wrong. If the car is the parents', then the author is in the wrong because the parents handled it. The post doesn't clarify ownership, but the user is the one who owns the car, as they left it at their parents' house. The parents might have been acting as caretakers but not legal owners. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
