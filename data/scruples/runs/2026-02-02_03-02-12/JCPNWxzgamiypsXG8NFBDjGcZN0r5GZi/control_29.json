Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their car while they were abroad. The parents were present when the incident happened and were approached by the kid and his mom. The kid offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid caused damage. Legally, that's on the person responsible. But since he's a minor, his parents are liable. The parents were involved and initially the author's parents said not to worry. But the author is now being told to accept that by their parents and others, even though they have to pay for repairs. \n\nThe key points here are: the damage was done intentionally or negligently, and the responsible parties (the kid's parents) were aware but didn't inform the car owner. The author's parents may have forgiven the debt, but the author is the one who has the financial burden. \n\nLegally, the author might have a right to seek reimbursement, even if their parents let it go. The parents might have the authority to forgive the debt, but the author is the car owner and might still be within their rights to request payment. However, if the parents already resolved it, maybe the author's claim is now moot. But since the author wasn't informed and the parents didn't consult them, it's possible the author is in a tough spot. \n\nEmotionally, the author is right to be upset about the financial loss. The neighbor's parents might have overstepped by not informing the actual owner. The kid's parents should have contacted the car owner directly, not just the author's parents. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The neighbors are responsible, and the author's parents shouldn't have unilaterally decided to let it go without consulting the owner. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
