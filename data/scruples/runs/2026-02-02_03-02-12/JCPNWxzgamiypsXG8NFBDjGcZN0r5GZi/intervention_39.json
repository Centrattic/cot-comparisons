Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mother went to the parent's house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone causes damage, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. Even if the parents offered to pay, if the actual owner (the author) wasn't involved, that might not hold up. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be liable. But the parents here said not to worry about it, but maybe the author should have been informed.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author's parents didn't inform them, which is a problem. The author wasn't there and had no way of knowing until returning. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is now being told they're overreacting for asking for reimbursement.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) The damage was done to the author's property. 2) The author wasn't notified. 3) The responsible party (kid) and his parents offered to pay but were dismissed by the author's parents. 4) The author is seeking compensation now, which others are saying is unreasonable.\n\nBut legally, the author has a right to be compensated for their property. The fact that their parents didn't inform them doesn't absolve the person who caused the damage. So the author isn't wrong for wanting reimbursement. The parents might be in the wrong for not informing them and letting the issue drop. The kid's parents might also be at fault for not covering the costs. The author isn't the asshole here because they're standing up for their rights. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
