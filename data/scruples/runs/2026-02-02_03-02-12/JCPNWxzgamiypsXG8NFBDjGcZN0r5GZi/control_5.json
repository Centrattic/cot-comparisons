Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1000 in damage. The kid's parents and the author's parents were involved, and the author's parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get compensation. People are telling them they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, when someone damages another's property, they're usually responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable. The fact that the parents were informed but the car owner wasn't is a problem. The author's parents might have resolved the issue by accepting an apology and saying not to worry, but the actual car owner wasn't involved in that decision. That could be a problem because the owner is the one who incurred the expense.\n\nMoral responsibility: The kid hit the car and should take responsibility. The parents of the kid offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. However, the author is the one who owns the car and has to pay for repairs. The author's parents might have overstepped by not informing the owner. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so their anger is about being left out of the resolution process and having to cover the costs.\n\nCommunity response says the author is the asshole, but that seems off. The author is just seeking reimbursement for something they didn't cause. The real issue is that the responsible parties (the kid and his parents) didn't properly address the claim. The author's parents might have been too lenient, but the author isn't at fault here.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong because they're seeking compensation for damages they didn't cause, and the responsible parties didn't properly inform or reimburse them.\n"
