Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away in Germany. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, who apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now, the author is upset because they had to pay $1,000 and everyone says they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid was a minor, but his parents are legally responsible for his actions. The parents might have agreed to let it go when they spoke to the author's parents, but maybe they shouldn't have because the actual owner (the author) wasn't involved in that decision. \n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author didn't know about the damage until returning, which is unfair. The parents chose not to inform them, possibly to avoid conflict. But the author is now out $1,000. The neighbors did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents didn't follow through. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, they might not be. They're the rightful owner, and the parents might not have the authority to waive that. Morally, the neighbors did something wrong by causing damage and not informing the owner. The author is seeking reimbursement, which is reasonable. The parents' decision to let it slide might be seen as their choice, but that doesn't absolve the other party of responsibility. \n\nReddit's \"Am I the Asshole?\" often hinges on whether the person is being unreasonable. The author is seeking what they're owed, which isn't unreasonable. The neighbors and the parents dismissing it could be seen as not taking responsibility. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
