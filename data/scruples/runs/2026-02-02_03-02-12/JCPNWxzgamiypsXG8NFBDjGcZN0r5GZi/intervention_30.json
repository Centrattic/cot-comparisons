Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and maybe offered to pay, but the parents let it slide. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. Others think he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, when someone damages another person's property, they're usually liable for repairs. The kid is a minor, so the parents would be responsible. The fact that the kid offered to pay is a good sign, but the parents dismissed it. The author's parents told the neighbor not to worry about it, which might have been an attempt to avoid conflict, but that doesn't absolve the responsibility. \n\nThe author didn't know about the incident because he was away. His parents decided not to inform him, maybe thinking it was resolved. But the car is his, so he has a right to know. Asking for reimbursement isn't unreasonable. The key points here are liability, responsibility, and communication. \n\nThe neighbors had a duty to inform the car owner, especially since the owner wasn't present. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but the author's right to know and seek compensation stands. The kid's age is a factor in terms of maturity, but the parents are still responsible. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the author's parents let it go, the author is within his rights to pursue compensation since he's the car's owner. The fact that he's being called an asshole for asking suggests that others might be downplaying the situation, not considering the financial impact on him. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the neighbor's family to cover the damage, and the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. The answer should be B.\n"
