Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while the author was away. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because he had to pay $1,000 in damages and no one is reimbursing him. He's being told he's the asshole for asking for compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they are legally responsible for repairs. Even if the parents told the kid not to worry about it, the author might still have a right to seek reimbursement. However, if the parents already resolved it, maybe there's a social expectation here. But the author wasn't involved, so maybe the resolution wasn't valid without his consent.\n\nThen there's the social angle. The parents might have tried to smooth things over, but the author is the one who actually owns the car and has to pay. It's unfair for the parents and neighbors to dismiss his claim. The kid was at fault, and even if it's a minor, the parents are usually responsible for their child's actions. So the author has a valid point in seeking compensation.\n\nThe neighbors might think the author is overreacting because they resolved it with the parents, but the author wasn't part of that. The key issue is that the author didn't receive any notice or compensation, which is a problem. The parents' dismissal doesn't negate the author's right to reimbursement.\n\nAlso, the kid did offer to pay, but the parents turned it down. The author's parents might have acted out of kindness, but that doesn't absolve the kid's responsibility. The author is within his rights to ask for compensation, especially since the damage was to his property. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
