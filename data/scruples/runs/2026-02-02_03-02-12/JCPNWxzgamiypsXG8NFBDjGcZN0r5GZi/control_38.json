Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were there when it happened, let the kid and his mom know it's okay, didn't press charges, and now when the author returns, they're upset they have to pay for the repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and moral aspects here. Legally, when someone's property is damaged, they have the right to seek compensation. The parents were present at the scene. If they said not to worry about it, maybe they intended to handle it, but the author wasn't informed. The kid was 16, so a minor, so liability might fall on the parents.\n\nMorally, the author is upset because they didn't know about the damage and have to pay out of pocket. The neighbors were told by the parents not to worry, but the parents might not have the authority to forgive the debt on the author's behalf. The author is now seeking reimbursement, which others are calling overreacting.\n\nThe key points: The parents were acting as temporary caretakers since the author was away. They might have made a decision without the owner's consent. The kid's parents might be responsible here. The author is being blamed for seeking what's owed, but they weren't part of the original interaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents who allowed the damage to go unpaid might be at fault for not informing their child's parents properly. The author is not in the wrong because they're seeking compensation for damage not their fault. The neighbors, especially the kid's family, should be liable. The author's parents might have overstepped by dismissing the issue. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
