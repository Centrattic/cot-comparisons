Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were away, and now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they aren't).\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author left their car parked at their parents' house. The neighbor's 16-year-old kid backed into it. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house. The parents said not to worry, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents declined. Now the author returns to find damage and is upset about the lack of reimbursement.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the car was damaged, the responsible party (the kid) was present, and the parents (the car owner's parents) handled the situation by not seeking compensation. The author is now upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting money. The question is whether the author is the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nHmm. Legally, when someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is usually liable for damages. The kid, being a minor, would have his parents responsible. However, the parents in this case (the car owner's parents) chose to let it go. The author, upon returning, is upset because they had to pay for repairs. The key here is whether the author's parents had the authority to waive the claim. If the car was the author's, then the parents might not have the right to decide not to seek compensation on the author's behalf. That could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if they believe their property was damaged and they have a right to reimbursement. However, the parents might have thought it was a minor issue or didn't want to involve the kid's parents in legal matters. But since the car's owner (the author) wasn't consulted, the parents overstepped. The author is justified in being upset because they're the one facing the financial burden. The kid did hit the car, so the responsibility to pay lies with him or his parents. The parents (the author's) shouldn't have dismissed it without the owner's consent.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B. The parents should have informed the author and let them decide. The kid should compensate for the damages, and the author is right to seek that. Others think the author is overreacting, but the financial loss is real for them. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
