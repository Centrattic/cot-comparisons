Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid damaging their car while they were away, and the parents didn't inform them or seek compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, when someone causes damage to another's property, they're usually responsible for covering the costs. The kid, being a minor, would have his parents liable. However, the parents here chose to let it go, which might be a parental decision to absorb the cost or avoid conflict.\n\nEthically, the author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get compensation. The parents might have felt it was a minor incident or didn't want to burden the kid. But the author is now facing unexpected expenses. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for asking for reimbursement. If the parents didn't inform the author and dismissed the issue, the author has a right to be upset. The kid caused the damage and should be responsible. The parents might have overstepped by not consulting the car owner, especially since the author is now the one dealing with the financial hit. \n\nReddit's typical response might be mixed, but the consensus here would likely side with the author not being in the wrong because the responsible party (the kid and his parents) should cover the damages. So the answer would be B.\n"
