Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad. The parents found out about the accident but were told by the kid's parents not to worry about it, and now the author is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay for the damages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone causes damage to another person's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The fact that the parents were present and maybe even agreed to handle it without involving the police could complicate things. But the author, as the car owner, has a right to be informed about the damage to their property. The parents not passing on this information might be part of the issue here.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents dismissed the situation, which left the author with the financial burden. The author is now being told they're overreacting for seeking reimbursement. But from their perspective, they're the ones out of pocket. It's reasonable for them to want compensation, especially since the damage wasn't their fault. \n\nI should also think about whether the author's reaction is justified. If the parents already handled the situation and the kid apologized, maybe there's an expectation that it's resolved. But the author wasn't informed and now has to deal with unexpected expenses. That seems unfair. The key points are responsibility for damage and right to compensation. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking reimbursement for damages they didn't cause. The real fault lies with the kid and his parents for not informing the owner and not covering the costs. So the answer should be B.\n"
