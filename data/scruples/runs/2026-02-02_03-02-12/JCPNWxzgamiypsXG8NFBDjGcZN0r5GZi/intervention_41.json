Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad. The parents didn't inform the author and dismissed the idea of seeking reimbursement. Now the author is upset and being told they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone causes damage to a vehicle, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be legally responsible. The parents might have a duty to cover the damages, even if the car owner's parents didn't ask for compensation. The fact that the parents told the neighbor's family not to worry about it doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The car owner has the right to seek reimbursement for their property damage.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author was away, so they couldn't handle the situation themselves. Their parents handled it, but maybe they overstepped by not informing the author. The author is now dealing with unexpected costs because no one thought to tell them. It's unfair that everyone is dismissing their claim, especially since the neighbor's family was offered to pay but the parents declined on their behalf. The author's reaction seems justified because they're now out of pocket and being blamed for being the asshole.\n\nAlso, the kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the author's parents told him not to worry about it. However, the author is the owner of the car, so their parents might not have the authority to waive the claim. The parents might have acted without considering the author's financial burden. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate claim for reimbursement since the damage was caused by someone else. The fact that others are dismissing their claim doesn't make it valid. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
