Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away. The key points here are: the kid caused damage, the parents were informed but told not to worry, and the author now wants reimbursement but is being called the asshole.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. If the kid was at fault, the parents (as guardians) might be responsible since he's a minor. But the parents already told the author's parents to not worry, which might mean they waived any claim. However, the author wasn't present, so maybe they weren't part of that agreement.\n\nNext, the moral side. The author is upset about unexpected expenses. The neighbor's parents might have dealt with the situation informally, but the author isn't getting compensation. The problem is that the author wasn't notified until returning, which is a valid point. The neighbor's parents could have informed the author earlier to avoid the surprise.\n\nAlso, the kid did apologize and offered to pay initially, but the author's parents dismissed it. Now the author is seeking reimbursement after the fact. The question is whether the author is overstepping by bringing it up now. If the agreement was to not pursue it, maybe the author is in the wrong for changing the terms later. But if the agreement wasn't explicit, the author has a right to seek compensation.\n\nAnother angle: the author's parents might have handled it without consulting the owner, which isn't their place. The author's right to their property and the damage caused could mean they're justified in seeking reimbursement. However, if the parents' agreement to let it go is valid, the author can't expect payment now.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's main issue is not being informed. The neighbor's parents might have resolved it without informing the owner, which could be part of the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation since the responsible parties (the kid's family) should cover the damage. The fact that everyone is calling the author the asshole might be because they're upset about the situation and want to hold the author accountable, but legally and morally, the author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement. So the answer is B.\n"
