Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor kid hit the author's parked car while they were away. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents to talk, offered to pay, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author returns and finds out about the $1000 damage, and no one told him. He's upset and wants reimbursement, but everyone says he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for the damages. The kid is 16, so maybe his parents are liable since he's a minor. But the parents were present when the accident happened and might share responsibility. However, the author's parents told them not to worry about it. That's a problem because they didn't inform the owner (author) and accepted the kid's apology. But the parents have the right to handle such matters if they own the property where the car was parked. Wait, the car is the author's, but he was away. So his parents had the car on their property. So maybe they're considered the temporary guardians? Not sure. Legally, the parents might have acted as the car's caretakers while the author was away. But they didn't inform him, which is an issue.\n\nMoral standpoint: The kid caused damage and didn't inform the owner. Even if the kid offered to pay, if the parents accepted that and said not to worry, but didn't pass on the information to the actual owner (author), the author is justified in feeling wronged. The author is the one who has to pay for the repairs. The parents might have acted out of politeness or not wanting to create conflict, but they didn't consider the author's financial burden. The author wasn't informed, so he couldn't make a decision on whether to accept the apology or pursue compensation. That's a key point. The parents should have contacted the author or ensured he was informed so he could decide.\n\nAlso, the kid's parents might be responsible. If they were present and aware of the incident, they should have made sure the owner was informed. The fact that they went to the author's parents but didn't contact the author himself is a big oversight. The author's parents might have a duty to inform him, but they didn't, which complicates things.\n\nSo, the author is not the one at fault here. The kid and his parents are responsible for the damage, and the author's parents failed to inform him. The author is right to be upset about the financial loss and not being informed. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
