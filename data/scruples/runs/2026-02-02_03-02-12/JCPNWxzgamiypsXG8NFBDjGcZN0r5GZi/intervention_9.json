Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents said not to worry about it, so the kid apologized but didn't pay for the damages. Now the author wants reimbursement and is being told by everyone to just let it go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone causes damage to another person's property, they are responsible for the costs. Since the kid is a minor, his parents would typically be liable. However, in this case, the parents did interact with the situation. They were present when the kid hit the car and were at their house. They might have been involved in resolving it, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author's parents might have dismissed the matter. \n\nBut the main issue here is that the author was away and wasn't informed. The parents of the kid didn't contact the car owner (the author) to discuss compensation. The author's own parents also didn't mention it. Now the author is returning and has to deal with the damage. The question is about moral responsibility. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone causes damage, even accidentally, they should compensate the victim. The kid offered to pay, but the parents didn't follow through. The author is upset because he's the one facing the financial loss. The people around him are telling him to let it go, which might be because they think it's a minor matter or that the kid's family is being lenient. But the author is justified in wanting to be compensated for his damages. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. Since the author's parents were present and handled the situation, maybe they should have communicated to their son that there was an issue. But the author wasn't consulted about whether he wanted to waive the compensation. The author's parents might have assumed he wouldn't mind, but the author clearly does. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The neighbor's family is responsible for the damage, and the author has the right to expect compensation. The people telling him he's the asshole are likely not in a position to understand his financial burden. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
