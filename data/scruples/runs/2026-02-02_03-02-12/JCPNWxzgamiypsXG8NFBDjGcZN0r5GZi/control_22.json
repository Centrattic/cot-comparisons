Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were away. The author wasn't there, their parents were. The kid and his mom went to talk to the parents, and the parents said not to worry about it. The kid offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. Now the author is coming back and upset about the $1000 damage, and everyone's telling him he's the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone damages your property without your consent, they're responsible for the damages. The kid was 16, which is a minor, but the parents might be liable as well. However, the parents might have already accepted the apology and dismissed the matter, which could complicate things. If the parents told the kid not to worry about paying, maybe the author can't just later demand payment because the parents already resolved it in a different way.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is upset because they had to pay for something they didn't cause. They weren't even there, so they couldn't handle the situation directly. The parents might have thought it was a kind gesture to not pursue compensation, but the author is now out of pocket. The kid did apologize and offered to pay, so there's some acknowledgment of fault. But if the parents accepted the apology and said not to worry about it, the author might not have a legal leg to stand on now.\n\nBut wait, the car is the author's property. The parents might have the right to handle the situation, but maybe they didn't consider their child's financial burden. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to get their money back, right? They didn't cause the damage. However, if the parents already resolved the issue by forgiving the debt, the author might be in a tough spot. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because the damage was done to their car, and they have a right to compensation. But if the parents had already accepted the apology and waived the payment, then maybe the author is overstepping by asking for money later.\n\nAnother angle: the kid's age. At 16, he's a minor, so the parents would be responsible for any legal claims. But if the parents already resolved it with the parents of the author, the author's parents might have no standing to claim again. The author is now the one who has to bear the cost, which they didn't expect. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to get their money back, especially if the parents didn't take responsibility when they were there.\n\nBut the key point is whether the parents had the authority to waive the compensation. If they did, then the author can't claim now. If not, the author is within their rights. It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the parents might have the authority to handle the matter, but morally, the author is the one who suffers the financial loss. However, the parents might have made a decision in the author's absence, which could be seen as acceptable. So the answer might depend on whether the parents had the right to forgive the debt. Since the car is the author's, maybe the parents shouldn't have decided that without consulting them. But in practice, sometimes parents act on behalf of their adult children, especially if they're living together.\n\nIn conclusion, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because the damage was done to their property, and they have a right to compensation. However, the parents' actions might have precluded that. But if the parents didn't have the authority, then the author isn't at fault. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
