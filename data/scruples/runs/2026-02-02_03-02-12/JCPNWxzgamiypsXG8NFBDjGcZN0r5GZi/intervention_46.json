Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away. The parents were there and the kid and his mom came over to resolve it, but the parents told them it's okay, no need to worry. The author came back to find the damage and is upset they didn't get reimbursed. Everyone says they're the asshole for asking, but the author feels it's the kid's responsibility.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A or B. Let's break it down. Legally, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for compensation. The kid is a minor, but his parents should handle it. However, the parents were present and the author's parents forgave the debt. But the author wasn't there to make that decision. The parents might have thought it's better to avoid conflict, but morally, should they have informed the author?\n\nThe key points here are: The damage was done, the parents were present, they didn't notify the author, and now the author is out of pocket. The parents might have dismissed it, but the author is the actual owner of the car. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. But the author isn't the one who forgave the debt; they weren't there. So, is the author wrong to seek reimbursement?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the parents might not have the authority to forgive the debt on the author's behalf. The author has the right to pursue compensation. However, socially, people might think the author is being unreasonable because the parents handled it. But legally and ethically, the person who caused damage should cover the costs. The author isn't at fault for expecting that. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
