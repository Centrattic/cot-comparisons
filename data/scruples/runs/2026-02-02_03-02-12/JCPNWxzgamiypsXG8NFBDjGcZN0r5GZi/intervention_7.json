Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to their parents' house after the accident, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author comes back to find out about the damage and wants reimbursement, but everyone is telling them they're the asshole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if someone causes damage to your property, they are responsible for it. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents dismissed it might be a problem. Legally, the parents might not have the authority to waive the responsibility on behalf of their child. But maybe in some jurisdictions, they can. However, the author wasn't even informed, which complicates things. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The car is the author's property, and they weren't consulted. The parents made a decision without the owner's input. The author has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The neighbors might have thought settling it privately without involving the owner was acceptable, but the owner's right to compensation isn't negated by others' good intentions.\n\nThe author's frustration is about not being informed and not getting compensation. The neighbors might have thought it was resolved, but the author's perspective is that they lost money and had no say. The key points here are property rights and responsibility. The kid caused damage, so the responsible parties (the kid and his parents) should cover the costs. The fact that the parents dismissed it doesn't absolve them of liability.\n\nSo, from a legal and ethical standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what's owed to them. The neighbors made a unilateral decision without the owner's consent. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
