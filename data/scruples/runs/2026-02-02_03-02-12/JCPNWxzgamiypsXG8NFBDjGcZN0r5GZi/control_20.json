Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were told, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get compensation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The car was parked at the author's parents' house. The kid hit it, and the parents were there. They interacted with the kid and his parents, who were upset about calling the police or filing a claim. The parents let it go, and the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author didn't know until returning home and is now upset about the $1,000 damage.\n\nNow, from a legal perspective, when someone causes damage to property, they can be liable. However, if the parents (as legal guardians) accepted the apology and waived any claim, that might affect the situation. But the problem is the author's car was damaged, and they didn't get a chance to make a decision about reimbursement. The parents acted on their behalf, but the author is the car owner.\n\nIn some places, parents can settle minor claims, but if the damage is significant, the car owner might have rights. The kid is a minor, so the parents would be responsible. The author's parents might have been too quick to dismiss it. The author is being told he's the asshole because he's now asking for money after the parents already said it's okay. But the author wasn't consulted, and the damage is their financial burden.\n\nEthically, the kid did wrong by hitting the car. The parents of the kid might be responsible to cover the cost. The author's parents might have been too forgiving without considering their child's wishes. The author is in a tough spot because they didn't get a say. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're seeking compensation for something they didn't cause. However, the parents' actions might be complicating it. But the author isn't at fault for the accident itself. The neighbors caused the damage, so the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. The parents might have been too hasty in dismissing it. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
