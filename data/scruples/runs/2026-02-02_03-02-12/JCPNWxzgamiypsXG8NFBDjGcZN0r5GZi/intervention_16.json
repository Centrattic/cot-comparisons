Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car. The scenario is that the kid hit the car while the author was away, and the parents didn't inform them and dismissed the issue.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: In many places, when someone damages another's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid, being 16, is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The fact that they were informed and offered to pay initially suggests they acknowledge the responsibility, but the parents here waved it off. The author didn't know until returning, which is a problem because they missed the window to make a claim. But was the author wrong for seeking reimbursement now?\n\nMoral angle: The author is being told they're overreacting. But financially, $1,000 is a significant amount. If the responsible party was informed and agreed to pay but didn't, the author has a right to seek compensation. The parents' decision not to inform the author might be negligent, but the kid's family is still at fault.\n\nCommunity response: The user mentions that everyone thinks the author is the asshole. That's a red flag. If everyone is dismissing the author's valid claim just because they're upset, that's not fair. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be reimbursed for damages they didn't cause.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author should have known about the risk of leaving a car unattended, but that's not their fault. Also, the time delay might affect the claim, but if the responsible party was there and offered to pay, the author has a right to pursue it now.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what's rightfully theirs. The answer should be B.\n"
