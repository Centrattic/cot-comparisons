Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were away in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because he didn't know about the damage until he returned and there's no compensation. The parents and others think he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone damages another person's property, they're generally responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be legally liable. However, in this case, the parents did offer to pay but were told not to worry. But the key here is that the author wasn't informed at all. The parents of the kid and the author's own parents didn't inform the author, who was abroad. That seems odd. \n\nEthically, even if the kid apologized and the parents offered to pay, not informing the car owner (the author) about the damage seems like a problem. The author had no way of knowing until he came back, and now he has to deal with the repair costs out of pocket. The parents of the kid might have taken responsibility by offering to pay, but the author's parents dismissed the issue. \n\nThe author is upset because he's now responsible for $1,000 in damages that he wasn't aware of. From a fairness standpoint, the person who caused the damage should cover the costs, even if they're a minor. The parents might have the legal obligation here. The author's parents might have handled the situation in a way that seemed dismissive, which left the author in the lurch. \n\nBut then again, the kid's parents did offer to pay, and the author's parents said it's okay. The problem is that the author wasn't consulted. If the author's parents had the authority to forgive the debt, maybe that's their call. However, the car is the author's property, so he should have been informed and involved in the decision. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a minor causes damage, the parents are responsible. So even if the kid offered to pay, the parents might still need to cover it. But in this case, the parents did offer, but the author's parents accepted the apology and said not to worry. However, the author wasn't part of that conversation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for seeking reimbursement? The author is standing up for his property rights. The fact that he wasn't informed is a key point. The parents who handled the situation might have done so without considering the owner's perspective. The author isn't overreacting; he's trying to get compensation for a valid claim. The people telling him to drop it might not realize the financial burden he's facing. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The kid and his parents are responsible, and the author has the right to seek reimbursement. The parents who dismissed the issue without consulting the owner were in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
