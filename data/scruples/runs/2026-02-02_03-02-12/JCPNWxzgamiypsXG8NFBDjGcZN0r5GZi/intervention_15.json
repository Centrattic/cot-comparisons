Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents were informed by the author's parents, but the damage wasn't communicated to the author, and no reimbursement was offered. The author is upset about the lack of communication and compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess fault. The kid hit the car, which is an accident. The kid and his parents were aware of the damage and even apologized. However, the author's parents told them not to worry about it. So, the key points here are: the damage was done, the responsible party was informed, but the owner wasn't. The author didn't know about the incident until returning home. \n\nLegally, the person who caused the damage is generally responsible for covering the costs. But since the author's parents handled the situation by dismissing the issue, the kid's family didn't compensate. The author is now upset because they have to pay for the repairs they didn't know about. \n\nMoral responsibility: The kid made a mistake, but the parents (both the kid's and the author's) played a role. The author's parents might have thought it was a minor issue or didn't want to cause trouble. However, the author is the rightful owner and should be informed. Not informing them and not seeking compensation could be seen as unfair to the author. \n\nSocially, people might say the author is overreacting because the kid was apologetic and the parents were involved. But the author isn't at fault for wanting to be reimbursed for something they didn't cause. The author's parents might have made a judgment call to let it go, but that doesn't absolve the kid's family of responsibility. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. They have a right to be informed about the damage to their property and to seek compensation. The author's parents might have mishandled the situation by not passing on the information and not ensuring compensation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
