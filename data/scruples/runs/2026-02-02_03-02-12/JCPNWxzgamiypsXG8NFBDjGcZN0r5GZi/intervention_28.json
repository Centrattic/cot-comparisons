Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents to resolve it, but the parents let it go. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting reimbursement. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid caused damage. Legally, even if he's a minor, his parents are usually responsible for any damages. Since the parents were present when the incident happened, they should have covered the cost. The parents might have agreed verbally, but that doesn't absolve them of liability. The author's parents didn't inform them, which isn't their fault. The author's right to seek reimbursement isn't negated by their parents' decision. The parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, but that doesn't mean the author shouldn't be compensated. The author isn't the one who caused the damage; they're the victim. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
