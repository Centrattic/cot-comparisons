Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away in Germany for three months. The parents initially said not to worry about it when the kid offered to pay, but now the author is upset because they didn't get any reimbursement and no one told them. The friends think the author is the asshole for asking later.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The kid caused damage, so under normal circumstances, they'd be responsible. The parents were present when the incident happened and told the kid not to worry about it. But the author didn't know and is now seeking compensation. \n\nLegally, if the parents accepted the kid's offer to pay and then told the owner not to worry, maybe they waived any claim. But maybe the kid's responsibility still stands. The author's parents might have acted as their agents, so if they forgave the debt, the author can't later demand payment. However, the author's parents might not have the authority to do that without consulting them. \n\nMorally, the kid made a mistake and took responsibility by apologizing and offering to pay. The parents accepted that offer at the time. The author not being informed is a problem, but maybe the parents should have checked with them first. The author is now in a bind because they have to pay the damages but the parents already handled it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't know about the incident and are seeking reimbursement. If the parents forgave the debt, the author can't collect. If they didn't have the right to forgive, maybe the author is justified. But the kid and parents did make an offer and apology. The author might be overreacting because the parents already resolved it. But maybe they should have been informed. So the answer depends on whether the parents had the authority to waive the claim. If they didn't, the author isn't in the wrong. If they did, the author is being unreasonable. Hmm. I think the key point is that the parents acted without consulting the author. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation now, but the parents might have been wrong to dismiss it initially. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
