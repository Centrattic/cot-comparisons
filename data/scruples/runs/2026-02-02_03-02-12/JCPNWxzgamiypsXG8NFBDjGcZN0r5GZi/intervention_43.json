Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and are being told they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If a minor causes damage, their parents are usually liable. The kid was 16, so a minor, so his parents would be responsible. The author's parents might have forgiven the debt, but the actual owner (the author) wasn't consulted. Legally, the parents might not have the authority to waive the claim on behalf of the car's owner. So the author could be justified in seeking compensation.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author wasn't informed about the accident. The parents handled it without the owner's knowledge. The kid admitted fault and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is now out $1,000, which is a significant expense. It's understandable they'd want to recover the cost. \n\nThe community's reaction is that the author is overreacting, but that's based on the idea that the parents already handled it. However, the author wasn't part of those discussions. They were away, so they have a right to be informed and to decide how to proceed. Their parents might have their own reasons for not wanting to pursue it, but that doesn't absolve the responsible party.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, the author might have a case. Morally, they're justified in wanting compensation since they weren't involved in the initial resolution. The parents shouldn't have made that decision without consulting the car's owner. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
