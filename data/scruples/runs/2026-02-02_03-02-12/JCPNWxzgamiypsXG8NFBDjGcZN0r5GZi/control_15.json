Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and let it go without the owner's knowledge. Now the owner is upset about the $1k damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If a minor causes damage, the parents are usually responsible. The kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. But they didn't inform the car owner. The problem here is that the parents resolved the issue without consulting the actual car owner. The author, as the owner, has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. \n\nNext, social norms. Even if the parents tried to handle it, the owner has the right to be informed. Not telling the owner could be a breach of trust. Also, the parents might have dismissed the owner's concerns by not passing along the info. \n\nThe author is upset because they have to pay for the damage they weren't aware of. The neighbors didn't inform them, and the parents didn't make sure the author knew. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so expecting reimbursement seems fair. \n\nThe neighbors might say they tried to resolve it, but the author's right to compensation is valid. The parents might have thought it was resolved, but the author's financial loss is real. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're being reasonable in seeking reimbursement after being kept in the dark. \n\nAnswer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
