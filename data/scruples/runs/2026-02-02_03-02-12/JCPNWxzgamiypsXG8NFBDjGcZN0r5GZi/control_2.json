Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present when the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. The author comes back to find out about the $1000 damage and wants reimbursement, but everyone's telling him he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if someone causes damage to your property, they are liable for it. Since the kid is a minor, his parents would be responsible. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents dismissed it might complicate things. But legally, the parents might still be responsible for their child's actions. However, if they already told the kid not to worry about it, maybe they think the matter is settled. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author wasn't told, so he's out of the loop. The parents might have thought it was a small matter or didn't want to involve the owner who was away. But the author is now facing the financial burden. The kid did hit the car, so he should be held accountable. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the owner and dismissing the compensation. \n\nAlso, the author's frustration is understandable. He's out $1000 and the people around him aren't helping. The question is if he's in the wrong for asking for reimbursement. Since the parents initially said not to worry, maybe the author is overstepping by coming back and demanding payment. But on the other hand, the parents might have made a mistake in handling the situation without informing the owner. \n\nI think the key points are: the kid's responsibility, the parents' role in resolving it, and the author's right to be informed and seek compensation. If the parents had the authority to waive the claim, then the author might be in the wrong. But if they didn't have the right to do that, then the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, the car owner has the right to seek compensation for damages, regardless of who was present. The parents might have tried to handle it themselves, but they can't unilaterally dismiss the owner's right to compensation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The answer would be B.\n"
