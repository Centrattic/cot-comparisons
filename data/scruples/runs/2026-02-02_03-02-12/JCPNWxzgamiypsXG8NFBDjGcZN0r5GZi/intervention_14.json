Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The parents were present and told the kid's family not to worry about it, but the author is upset because he didn't get reimbursed and he wasn't informed about the damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Generally, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. However, the parents of the kid and the author's parents decided to handle it without involving the author. The author wasn't informed, which is a key point. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author might have the right to seek compensation. The fact that his parents told the other parents not to worry about it doesn't necessarily absolve the other party of responsibility. The author is the owner of the car, so he should be informed and involved in any decisions regarding compensation. \n\nOn the other hand, cultural norms and family relationships might play a role here. The parents might have wanted to avoid conflict by handling it amicably, but that doesn't mean they acted in the author's best interest. The author is upset because he's now facing unexpected costs and wasn't kept in the loop. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The answer depends on whether the parents had the authority to waive the author's rights. Since the author is an adult and the car is his, the parents might not have the legal authority to make that decision. The kid's parents are responsible for their child's actions, so the author is justified in seeking compensation. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The kid's family should cover the damages, and the author is right to pursue reimbursement.\n"
