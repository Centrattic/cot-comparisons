Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents let it go. Now the author comes back to find the damage and wants reimbursement but everyone's telling him to just accept it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The kid caused the damage. He apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were told it's okay. The author didn't know until returning. The key points here are responsibility for damages, the parents' role in letting it go, and the author's right to seek reimbursement.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, when someone's property is damaged, the person responsible is usually liable. Even if the parents forgave the debt, the author might still have a right to pursue compensation, especially if it's a significant amount. However, if the parents already accepted the apology and refused compensation, the author might have a hard time getting it later. But the author didn't know about the incident until returning, so maybe that's different.\n\nMoral standpoint: The kid made a mistake, took responsibility by offering to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is now being blamed for \"overreacting\" when they want their money back. That seems unfair. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the author and dismissing his claim. The author's problem is that they weren't in the loop and now have to deal with unexpected costs. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. If the parents were the legal guardians and they forgave the debt, maybe the author can't later demand payment. But if the parents were not the owners of the car, they might not have the authority to forgive the debt. The car belongs to the author, so they have the right to seek compensation. The parents might have made a mistake by not informing them. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, if you're the owner of the property, you can pursue compensation for damages. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be reimbursed. The kid and his parents are responsible. The author's parents might have been wrong to not inform them and to let it slide. The author's reaction is understandable because they weren't aware and now have to pay. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to seek compensation for damages caused by someone else. The parents and the kid's parents may have mishandled the situation by not involving the author.\n"
