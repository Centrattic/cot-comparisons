Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, but the kid didn't pay for the damage. Now the author is upset when they return and is being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. So the kid is 16, so a minor, so his parents should cover the costs. But the parents said not to worry about it. But the author's parents, who were present, also said not to worry. But the author wasn't consulted, so they didn't get any compensation.\n\nThe author is upset because they have to pay for the damage, and everyone else is telling them to drop it. The question is if the author is wrong to ask for reimbursement. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents of the kid should have covered the damage. The author's parents might have waived the claim, but the author wasn't there to make that decision. So the author is justified in seeking reimbursement because the damage wasn't their fault. The kid didn't inform them, and the parents involved didn't ensure compensation. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to be compensated for damages caused by someone else. The people telling them they're the asshole are probably not considering the financial burden the author faces. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
