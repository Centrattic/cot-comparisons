Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted about their neighbor's kid hitting their car is in the wrong. The key points here are that the kid hit the car, the parents were informed, the parents told the kid not to worry about it, and now the original owner is upset because he wasn't told and isn't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If someone's property is damaged without their consent, they have a right to seek compensation. The fact that the parents were there and the kid offered to pay but was told not to worry about it might complicate things. But does the original owner have the right to seek reimbursement since he wasn't present?\n\nThen there's the issue of notification. The car owner wasn't informed of the incident, which could be a problem. If the parents were the ones who told the kid not to worry about it, maybe they had the authority to make that decision. But does the car owner have the right to know about the damage? That's a point to consider.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if the parents forgave the damage, the car owner is now out of pocket. The kid was responsible for the damage, so the parent's forgiveness might not absolve the kid's responsibility. However, if the parents were acting on behalf of the owner, maybe they could forgive the debt. But since the owner wasn't involved, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the parents might have overstepped by making the decision without consulting the car owner. The owner is now in a position where they have to pay for something that wasn't their fault. The kid's family's reaction to being asked for reimbursement is another factor. They might be upset because they thought the matter was resolved through the parents.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the legal responsibility for a minor's actions falls on the parents. So even if the kid apologized, the parents might be responsible for covering the costs. If the parents told the kid not to worry about it, but the owner is now seeking compensation, the parents might be liable.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole. If the author is seeking reimbursement for a legitimate damage caused by someone else, they aren't in the wrong. The parents might have made a mistake by not informing the owner and by forgiving the debt without his consent. The kid is responsible for the damage, so the author has a right to seek compensation.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. The kid and his parents are responsible for the damage, and even though the parents were present, they shouldn't have taken away the owner's right to seek compensation. The author is justified in being upset and seeking reimbursement.\n"
