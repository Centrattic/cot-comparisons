Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present and the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author comes back to find $1,000 damage and is upset that they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical perspectives. Legally, when someone damages another's property, they're typically responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be legally responsible. However, in this case, the parents and the author's parents resolved the matter without informing the author. Ethically, the author is upset because they weren't informed and now have to pay for repairs. The parents might have intended to handle it amicably, but the author feels wronged because they weren't involved in the decision.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for asking for reimbursement? The key points here are communication and responsibility. The author wasn't present, so they couldn't make the decision. The parents might have thought they were being kind by not involving the author, but that's not the case. The author has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation, especially if their parents didn't follow through. The neighbors did offer to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. So the author isn't at fault for seeking reimbursement; the issue is that the parents handled it without the owner's consent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
