Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents to resolve it, but the parents didn't inform the author and just told the kid to apologize. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1,000 for repairs and feels everyone else thinks they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and social aspects here. Legally, if someone causes damage to another's property, they are usually responsible for covering the costs. Even if the owner isn't present, the person at fault should notify the owner and cover damages. The kid's parents might be responsible here since minors can't be held fully accountable, so the parents step in. However, the author's parents didn't inform them, which might be a point of contention. \n\nSocially, the author's parents might have thought it was a minor issue or didn't want to cause conflict. But the author is the actual victim here, and not being informed about the damage and the lack of compensation is understandable for them to be upset. The fact that no one told the author and that the parents handled it without involving the owner could be seen as a mistake. \n\nThe author is asking for reimbursement, which is their right. The others are dismissing their request, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The kid and his family are at fault for causing damage and not compensating. The parents not informing the owner adds to the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the responsibility lies with the kid and his parents. The answer should be B.\n"
