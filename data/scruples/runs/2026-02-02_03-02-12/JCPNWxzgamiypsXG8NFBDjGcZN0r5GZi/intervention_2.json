Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents were told about the accident by the author's parents, but they were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and everyone thinks they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone damages another person's property, they are responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be legally responsible as they are his guardians. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents dismissed it might complicate things. However, the parents might still have a responsibility here.\n\nEthically, the author's parents might have thought it was a minor issue, but the damage is $1000. The author didn't know about the accident until returning, so they were kept in the dark. The parents might have tried to be kind by not informing the author, but that doesn't absolve the other party of responsibility.\n\nThe author is now seeking reimbursement, which is a reasonable request. The neighbors might have felt that the author's parents had already resolved it, but the author wasn't consulted. The author isn't overreacting because they're the one who has to pay for the repairs. The neighbors and parents might not be considering the financial burden on the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to expect that someone who damages their property covers the costs. The neighbors and parents might have mishandled the situation by not involving the author, but the responsibility for the damage lies with them. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
