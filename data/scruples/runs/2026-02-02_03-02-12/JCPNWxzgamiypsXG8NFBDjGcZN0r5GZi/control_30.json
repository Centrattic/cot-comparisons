Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid damaged the author's parked car while they were abroad. The parents found out when the kid came to apologize, but they told them not to worry about it. Now, the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In many places, if someone causes damage to another person's property, they are responsible for covering the costs. The kid was 16, so minors can sometimes have their parents liable. However, in this case, the kid and his parents approached the author's parents, and they decided not to press charges. The author didn't know about the incident until returning.\n\nLegally, if the owner of the car isn't aware of the damage, they might not have a claim until they find out. But the parents were aware and might have the right to settle the matter. However, the author is the owner, so they might have the right to claim compensation once they become aware. The parents' decision to forgive the debt might not legally bind the author if they disagree.\n\nEthically, the kid caused damage and should take responsibility. The fact that the parents were informed and let it go doesn't absolve the kid's responsibility to the actual car owner. The author might be justified in seeking reimbursement, especially since they weren't part of the initial resolution.\n\nBut there's a cultural aspect too. In some places, people might downplay such incidents, especially between neighbors. The author's parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to want compensation now. The key points are whether the author has the right to claim after the fact and if the kid's family is legally obligated to pay.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The parents might have resolved it, but the author as the owner of the car has the right to claim compensation. The answer is B.\n"
