Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents were informed, but the author's parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get compensated and everyone's telling them to let it go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone causes damage, they're typically responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay might suggest accountability, but his parents pushed back against any formal action. However, the parents of the kid might still be legally responsible, even if the author's parents let them off the hook.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents chose not to press the matter, possibly to keep the peace, but the author is now left with the financial burden. The author is upset because they weren't informed until they returned, and they're being criticized for wanting reimbursement. The key points here are lack of communication and financial responsibility.\n\nThe author's main arguments are that they shouldn't have to pay for damages caused by someone else and that they weren't informed. The kid's side is that they were told it's okay by the author's parents. Legally, if the author's parents had the authority to waive compensation, maybe there's a case where the author can't claim it now. But if the parents didn't have the authority to make that decision on the author's behalf, then the author has a valid claim.\n\nAlso, the neighbor's parents might have known they weren't being held responsible and thus didn't inform the author properly. The author's parents might have made a decision without considering the author's financial situation, which is a point in the author's favor.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the responsibility for damages typically lies with the person who caused them, especially when it's a minor's parent. The fact that the author's parents let it go doesn't absolve the neighbor's family of their responsibility if the law requires it. The author is within their rights to seek compensation, even if emotionally it's easier to just let it go. So the answer is B.\n"
