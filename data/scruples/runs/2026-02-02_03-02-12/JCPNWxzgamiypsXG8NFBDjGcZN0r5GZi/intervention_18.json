Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their car while they were away, and the parents didn't inform them or seek reimbursement. The author is upset about the $1,000 damage and feels wronged.\n\nFirst, the kid was at fault for causing the accident. The parents tried to handle it, but the kid offered to pay, and the author's parents dismissed it. The author didn't know about the damage until returning. Now they want compensation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for wanting reimbursement. Legally, the kid's family should cover the damage since they were responsible. But the parents might have let it slide. However, the author didn't know and now is being blamed for being upset. \n\nThe author isn't at fault for the accident, but maybe they should have known about the car's location? But they were abroad, so maybe not. The parents' decision not to involve the kid's family in paying could be a problem. The author's reaction is understandable since they have the financial loss. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
