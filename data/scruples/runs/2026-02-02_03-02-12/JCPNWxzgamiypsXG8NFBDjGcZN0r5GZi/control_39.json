Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while the author was away in Germany. The parents were there and saw the incident. The kid and his mom came over to talk, and the author's parents told them not to worry about it, even though the kid offered to pay. Now the author comes back, finds out about the damage, and is upset because he didn't get reimbursed. He's being called an asshole for asking for money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for paying for the damages. Even if the parents were present, the kid's family might still be liable. The author's parents might have forgiven the debt, but the author is the car owner. So legally, shouldn't the author be the one to decide whether to forgive the debt? If the parents said not to worry about it, maybe they had the authority to do so, but maybe not. It depends on who owns the car. If the author owns the car, then the parents might not have the right to forgive the debt on his behalf. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author is upset because he had to pay $1,000 and is being told to just let it go. His parents and others think he's overreacting. But if he's the rightful owner, he's in a position to claim reimbursement. The kid's family might have been apologetic, but that doesn't absolve them of financial responsibility. The author's parents might have made a decision without consulting him, which could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the kid was 16, which is a minor. Parents are usually responsible for their minor children's damages, so the kid's parents should have covered it. If the author's parents told them not to worry about it, maybe the kid's family didn't have to pay, but the author, as the car owner, might still have a right to seek compensation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents had the authority to forgive the debt, then maybe the author is being unreasonable. But if they didn't, then he's justified in seeking reimbursement. The parents might have made a decision without considering that the car is the author's, not theirs. Therefore, the author isn't at fault here. He's the one who incurred the financial loss, and the parents might have overstepped. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
