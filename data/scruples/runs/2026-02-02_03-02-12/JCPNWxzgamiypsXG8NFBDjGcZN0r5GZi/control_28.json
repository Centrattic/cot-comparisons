Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents of the kid were present when the incident happened and were told by the author's parents not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get reimbursed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages another's property, they are legally responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. However, the author's parents chose to let it go, which might affect the legal recourse here. But legally, the author might still have a right to seek compensation, especially if their parents didn't have the authority to waive that right.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's parents handled the situation, but the car owner wasn't consulted. The author is now out $1,000. Should they have to bear that loss because their parents forgave the damage? Or does the responsibility lie with the person whose kid caused the damage? \n\nAlso, communication is a factor. The author wasn't informed, which adds to their frustration. Even if the parents tried to resolve it, not keeping the owner informed could be a point against the neighbor's family. \n\nThe neighbors might have felt pressured to let it go, especially if the author's parents were insistent. But the author is still the rightful owner of the car and should have a say in how the situation is handled. \n\nConsidering all this, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility for the damages should rest with the party that caused the accident. The author's parents might have made a decision without consulting the owner, but that doesn't absolve the other party of their responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
