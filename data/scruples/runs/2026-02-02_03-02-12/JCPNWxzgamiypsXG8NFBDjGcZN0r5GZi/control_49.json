Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is the asshole (AITA) after their neighbor's kid damaged their car and they're upset about not getting reimbursement. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person left their car parked at their parents' house while they were in Germany for three months. The neighbor's 16-year-old kid backed into the car, causing $1,000 damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now, the person returns and finds out about the damage, but no one told them, and they're being told to just forget it. They think the kid should reimburse them. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for wanting compensation. Let's break it down. Legally, if someone damages your property, they can be held responsible for damages. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be liable. However, the parents in this case already interacted with the kid and the author's parents, and the author's parents dismissed the issue. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and want money.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, when the incident happened, the author wasn't there. The kid and parents approached the author's parents, and the author's parents handled it by saying not to worry. The author didn't have any direct communication with the kid or parents. Now that the author is back, they're upset about the damage and want compensation. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has a right to seek compensation for property damage. But practically, since the author's parents already told the kid's parents to not worry about it, maybe the author's parents resolved it. However, the author's parents might not have the authority to forgive the debt on behalf of the author. The car belongs to the author, so the author is the one who should decide about compensation. \n\nThe kid's parents might have been negligent in not informing the author upon his return. Also, the kid's responsibility to inform the owner about the damage could be an issue here. If the kid's parents knew, and the author's parents knew, but didn't inform the author, maybe that's part of the problem. \n\nThe author is upset because they didn't get to make that decision themselves. They were in Germany, but the damage was done to their property. The fact that they had to pay $1,000 out of pocket is a valid concern. The answer depends on whether the author's parents had the authority to forgive the debt, or if the kid's parents were obligated to inform the author. \n\nIn many places, parents are legally responsible for their minor children's actions, so the kid's parents should cover the damages. The author's parents might have been wrong to dismiss the matter without consulting the author. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting compensation, especially since they weren't involved in the initial resolution. \n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole. The answer is B.\n"
