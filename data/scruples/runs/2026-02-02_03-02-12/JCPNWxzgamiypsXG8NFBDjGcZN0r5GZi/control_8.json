Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents, the kid apologized, offered to pay, but the parents said it's okay. Now the author is upset because he didn't get reimbursed and is being told he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The kid caused damage, so legally, the parents or the kid might be responsible. But since the parents were present and told the author's parents not to worry, maybe they tried to handle it themselves. But the author wasn't informed, which is a problem because he's the owner of the car. His parents didn't have the authority to waive his right to compensation, right? So maybe the author is justified in seeking reimbursement.\n\nThe kid did apologize and offer to pay, but his parents might have dismissed it. The author's parents might have thought it's a small matter, but the cost is $1k, which isn't trivial. The author is being told he's overreacting, but he's the one who has to pay for repairs. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. The neighbors didn't inform him, and the kid's family didn't properly compensate. The author's parents shouldn't have the authority to let that go. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
