Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid, 16 years old, hitting their parked car and causing $1,000 damage. The parents were present and the kid offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it, saying not to worry. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and now has to pay for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are responsible for covering the costs. Even if the owner isn't present, the person at fault should notify the owner and arrange compensation. The neighbor's family didn't inform the author, which is a problem. The parents might have resolved it among themselves, but that doesn't absolve them of the obligation to the actual owner.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author is the rightful owner of the car and was kept in the dark. They're now facing unexpected expenses. The neighbor's parents might have thought they sorted it out with the author's parents, but that's not the same as the actual owner. The author isn't overreacting because they have a right to know about the damage and seek reimbursement. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay suggests they admit fault, so the author is justified in expecting compensation.\n\nThe community's response on Reddit might be split, but the author isn't the asshole here. The responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage. The parents might have made a decision without considering the owner's rights. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
