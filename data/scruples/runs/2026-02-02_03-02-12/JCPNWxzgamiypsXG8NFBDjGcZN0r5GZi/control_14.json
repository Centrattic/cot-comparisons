Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The author's parents were there and told the kid's parents not to worry about it, so no one informed the author. Now, when the author returns, they're upset about the $1,000 damage and want reimbursement. People are saying the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. When someone's property is damaged, they have the right to seek compensation. The author wasn't present, so their parents had authority to act on their behalf. However, the parents decided not to pursue reimbursement, which might be their prerogative. But the author is now the rightful owner and is upset because they have to pay for the damage. \n\nLegally, if the parents acted as the legal representatives, they might have the authority to waive the claim. But ethically, the author might feel wronged because they didn't have a say. The kid did hit the car, so responsibility lies with the kid's family. However, the parents already handled the situation by letting it go. The author is now challenging that decision, which might be seen as overstepping if the parents had the right to make that choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one who owns the car and is being asked to bear the cost despite the accident not being their fault. The parents might have been trying to avoid conflict, but the author is now facing financial loss. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author's reaction is understandable because they're the one facing the financial burden. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's family should cover the damage. The parents might have been too quick to dismiss it, but the author is now trying to rectify that. However, the author is challenging a decision made by their own parents, which could complicate things. If the parents had legal authority to waive the claim, the author might not have grounds to pursue it now. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents had the right to let it go, then the author's anger might be misplaced. But if the parents didn't have the authority or acted without the owner's consent, then the author has a valid point. The answer hinges on whether the parents could legally and ethically make that decision for the author. Since the car is the author's, they might have the right to seek compensation regardless of their parents' actions. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement, especially since the damage wasn't their fault. The parents might have been too quick to let it slide, but the author is the rightful owner. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
