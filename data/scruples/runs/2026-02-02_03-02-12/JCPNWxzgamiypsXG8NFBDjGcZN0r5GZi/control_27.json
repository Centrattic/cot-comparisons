Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they have to pay for the damage and no one told them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're liable for damages. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be responsible. However, the parents were there at the scene. The parents and the kid offered to pay but the author's parents dismissed it. But since the car is the author's, they have the right to claim compensation. The parents might have made a mistake by not informing the author. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents might have been trying to keep the peace, especially if the neighbor is a teenager. But the author is now faced with a $1000 expense. The author is not wrong for seeking reimbursement because it's their property. The parents might have acted without the owner's consent. \n\nAlso, the neighbor kid didn't contact the car owner directly. Since the author was abroad, maybe the parents should have informed them immediately. But they didn't. The author's parents might have been too quick to forgive without consulting their child. \n\nSo, legally the neighbor is responsible. Socially, the author isn't wrong for wanting their costs covered. The parents acted on their own without the owner's input. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
