Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car when they were abroad. The parents were present when the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and has to pay for repairs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal responsibilities. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they're legally obligated to compensate for the damages. However, if the parents accepted the kid's apology and waved off the payment, does that legally absolve them? It might depend on the jurisdiction. In some places, parents might have liability for their minor's actions, but if they agreed not to pursue compensation, that could complicate things.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The kid was at fault, and even though the parents said not to worry, the car owner is now out $1000. The parents might have handled the situation without consulting the car owner, which is an issue. The author wasn't there to make that decision, so the fact that his parents dismissed the issue without his input is a key point.\n\nAnother angle: the parents were all upset about being told to call the police or file a claim. Their reaction might stem from wanting to avoid legal action or hassle, but that doesn't mean they're right. The car owner is the one who has to deal with the financial burden. The parents might have been too quick to forgive, not considering the owner's perspective.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. He's returning to a damaged car with no notice and no compensation. The people around him think he's overreacting, but they don't have to bear the cost. The kid's family might have the means to pay, so it's fair for the author to seek reimbursement.\n\nHowever, if the parents genuinely accepted the apology and refused to press charges, the author might have to navigate a situation where legally or socially, he's not getting the compensation. But ethically, the kid's family is still responsible. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so it's not his fault. The problem lies with the parents for not handling it properly when they had the chance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the kid and his parents for causing the damage and not ensuring compensation. The author's right to seek reimbursement hasn't been addressed, and his parents' decision to let it go doesn't absolve them of that responsibility. So the answer should be B.\n"
