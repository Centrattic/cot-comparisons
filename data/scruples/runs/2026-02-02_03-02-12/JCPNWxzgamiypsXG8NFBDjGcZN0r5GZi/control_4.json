Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key facts: A 16-year-old neighbor hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house to address it. The parents decided not to pursue compensation, even though the kid offered to pay. The author returns to find the damage and is upset about not being informed and having no compensation. Others are telling the author to let it go, but the author feels wronged.\n\nSo the main question is about liability. When someone's property is damaged by another, there's a legal obligation to compensate, right? The kid hit the car, which is a civil issue. The parents of the kid might be liable since he's a minor. But the author's parents dismissed the issue, even though they were present. But did the author's parents have the authority to waive the author's right to compensation? The author is the car's owner, so they might have a right to seek reimbursement regardless of what their parents said. \n\nThe author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. The neighbors didn't notify the actual owner, which is the author. Even if the parents were there, they aren't the legal owners of the car. So the neighbors' failure to contact the author directly is a problem. The author's parents might have made a decision that doesn't affect the legal responsibility of the kid's family. \n\nIn many places, parents of minors can be held responsible for their children's damages. So the author could still pursue legal action or a claim even if their parents didn't. The fact that the neighbors didn't inform the author directly is a red flag. The author's right to know about the damage is valid. They were out of the country, so they couldn't have known unless someone told them. The parents not informing them and dismissing the issue might have been a mistake. \n\nOthers saying the author is the asshole might be because they think it's a small amount or that it's better to let it go, but legally, the author isn't wrong to seek compensation. The kid admitted fault and offered to pay, which strengthens the author's case. The parents of the kid might have a duty to cover the costs since their child was at fault. \n\nSo putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbors and their parents are responsible for the damage and not informing the actual owner. The author has a right to seek reimbursement. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
