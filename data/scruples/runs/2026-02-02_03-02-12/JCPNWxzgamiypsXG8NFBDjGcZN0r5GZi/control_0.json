Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damages. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his parents, who offered to pay but were told not to worry about it. When the author returns, they're upset about not being informed and not getting compensation. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and moral aspects. Legally, when someone damages another's property, they're typically responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable. However, the parents were present and the author's parents dismissed the issue, telling them not to worry. In some jurisdictions, if the owner of the car (the author) wasn't present and the parents acted as temporary custodians, maybe there's a gray area. But the author's parents aren't the owners of the car, so their decision to let it go might not legally bind the author.\n\nMoral standpoint: The kid caused damage, apologized, and offered to pay. The author's parents accepted that, so maybe the issue was resolved. But the author wasn't consulted, which is a problem. The parents might have overstepped by making a decision without their child's input. The author is now out $1,000 and wants reimbursement. The kid and his parents might feel they already resolved it, but the author wasn't part of that resolution. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents had the authority to forgive the debt, maybe not. But since they didn't own the car, they probably didn't have that right. The author has a legitimate claim. However, the author is now coming back and possibly causing tension by seeking reimbursement after their parents let it go. The neighbors might feel it's too late, leading to the \"asshole\" label. \n\nBut legally, the author's parents can't forgive the debt on their behalf. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation. The neighbors, especially the kid, are responsible. The author's parents might be in the wrong for not informing them. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
