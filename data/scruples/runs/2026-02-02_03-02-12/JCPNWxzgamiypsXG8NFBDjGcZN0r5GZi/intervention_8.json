Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were in Germany. The parents told them not to worry about it, but the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and no one informed them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If a minor causes damage, usually the parents are responsible. The kid is 16, so a minor, so the parents would be liable. The parents and the kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. But the author isn't the one who was there; they were in another country. So maybe the parents shouldn't have dismissed the claim?\n\nThen, the ethical side. The author is being told they're overreacting for asking for reimbursement. But the damage is their car, and they have to pay for it. If the neighbor's family is responsible, shouldn't they cover the costs? The parents might have thought it's a minor incident, but $1,000 isn't negligible. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told not to worry about it complicates things. Maybe the author's parents made a decision without considering the author's perspective. \n\nAlso, the author wasn't informed. They came back to find the damage. That's a problem because they have the right to know about the incident. The neighbor's family didn't inform them, which is an issue. If the parents of the kid had told the author's parents, maybe they should have passed that info along. But they didn't, so the author is left in the dark. \n\nSo, the author is upset because they have to pay for something someone else caused. They're not the one who dismissed the claim; their parents did. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. They're the victim here. The neighbors and their parents are at fault for causing the damage and not taking responsibility. The author's parents might have made a mistake by not informing them and dismissing the offer. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They're within their rights to seek compensation for damages caused by another party. The neighbors should have informed them or followed through on the compensation.\n"
