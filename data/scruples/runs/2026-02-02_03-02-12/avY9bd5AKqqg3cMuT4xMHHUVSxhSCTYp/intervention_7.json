I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their actions. The situation is about a boyfriend moving in together and the author's sensitivity to the laptop's brightness, sound, and ASMR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, which is a common requirement for a good bedtime routine. They're asking their partner to adjust the laptop's settings when it's affecting their sleep. That seems reasonable because respecting each other's need for a good night's rest is important in a relationship.\n\nThen there's the ASMR part. The author mentions having misophonia towards whispering, which is a real condition. They showed a study to their partner, and he complied by putting in earphones. That shows the partner acknowledged the issue. The author is communicating their needs and boundaries, which is healthy. The partner's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If they're consistently asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being and the partner is making an effort, then the author isn't being unreasonable. Relationships require communication and compromise. The author is advocating for their needs, which is valid. The partner's guilt over his \"pleasure\" might indicate some sensitivity, but the author isn't being unkind; they're explaining their feelings and showing evidence. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author is being too controlling or not considering the partner's needs enough. But since the partner is making adjustments, it's a mutual effort. The author's health and comfort are important, especially when they have a medical condition like misophonia. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
