I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The author is asking her boyfriend to turn down his laptop's volume and brightness because she can't sleep with that. Also, she's uncomfortable with ASMR, especially whispering, which triggers her misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for silence and darkness to sleep. Misophonia is a real condition, so her discomfort with whispering ASMR isn't just being picky. She's communicated her needs, shown research, and he took action by putting earphones in. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. He might feel his needs are being ignored. But the author isn't stopping him from using earphones; she's just asking him to adjust when she's trying to sleep. It's about respecting each other's needs. Since moving in together, they need to compromise. The author is advocating for her health and well-being, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) shows he's trying to accommodate her.\n\nIs there a point where she's overstepping? Maybe if she were aggressive or didn't allow him any flexibility. But here, she's setting boundaries and he's complying. The key is mutual respect. Since she's not forbidding him from his routine entirely, just modifying it when she's in her space, that's reasonable. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
