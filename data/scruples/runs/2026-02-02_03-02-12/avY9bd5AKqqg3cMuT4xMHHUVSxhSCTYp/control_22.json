I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR watching when they're trying to sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine involving YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia, specifically to whispering ASMR, causing anxiety and discomfort. They've tried communicating this, shown a study, and the boyfriend responds by putting on earphones. The author is worried they're being too demanding.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author has a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that affects their well-being. They're communicating their needs to coexist in a shared living space. The boyfriend is making an effort to accommodate by using earphones. The author is asking for adjustments that are necessary for their comfort, not just personal preference.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a balance needed. The boyfriend might have his own needs, but the author's health is a valid concern. Since they live together, compromise is essential. The author isn't banning ASMR entirely but is asking for adjustments when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) shows he's making an effort. The author isn't being unreasonable here. Their requests are about creating a shared environment where both can have their needs met. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their health and well-being, which is important. The boyfriend is also trying to adjust. The situation requires mutual understanding and compromise, and the author is taking steps to communicate and find solutions. There's no clear wrongdoing here.\n"
