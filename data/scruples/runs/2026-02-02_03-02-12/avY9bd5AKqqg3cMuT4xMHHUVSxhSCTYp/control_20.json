I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially because the boyfriend's favorite is whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They moved in together, so they share a living space. The boyfriend uses his laptop in bed, probably for watching videos or listening to ASMR, which is something he's really into. The author, on the other hand, needs silence and darkness for their sleep routine. The boyfriend's activities are causing discomfort for the author. \n\nThe author mentions that they've shown him a study about misophonia and ASMR, which made him put in earphones. That part seems like they tried to explain their issue with evidence, which is reasonable. But the boyfriend still doesn't like being asked to adjust, so the author is concerned about being the asshole.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a shared living space, especially in a romantic relationship. Partners often have to make compromises. The author is asking for adjustments to their environment to ensure they can sleep properly. Misophonia is a real condition that can cause anxiety and other physical reactions when hearing certain sounds. If the boyfriend is aware of this and still does the ASMR, maybe he's being inconsiderate. However, the author is repeatedly asking, which might be coming off as nagging. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is trying to communicate their needs and has provided rationale (the study). The boyfriend then takes action (using earphones) when he sees the study, so he's responsive in that instance. However, if he's still not adjusting when the author asks about other things like brightness and volume, maybe there's a pattern here. \n\nIs the author overstepping by constantly reminding him? If the boyfriend has earphones and still chooses not to use them, or if he's using them but the brightness is still an issue, then the author's requests are valid. They have the right to a comfortable sleeping environment. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's hobby (ASMR) is something he enjoys. The author is limiting his ability to use the laptop in bed, which could be a problem if the boyfriend is doing it in his own space. But since they're sharing a room and a bed, the author's sensitivity should be a consideration. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they're communicating their needs, especially with a health condition involved. The boyfriend should be accommodating as long as it's reasonable. However, maybe there's a balance. If the boyfriend is using earphones and the brightness is low enough, the author might need to be more understanding. But since the author has to ask every night, it suggests that the adjustments aren't consistently made. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to maintain a sleep environment that's necessary for their well-being. The boyfriend should be willing to use earphones and lower brightness if that's the solution. If he's not, then the problem is on his side. The author is just asserting their needs, which is reasonable in a relationship.\n"
