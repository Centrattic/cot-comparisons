I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The main issues here are the boyfriend's bedtime routine involving YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disruptive.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they need silence and darkness, which is their bedtime routine. They've moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The boyfriend is using a laptop with sound and probably some light, which is affecting the author's ability to sleep. The author is asking him to turn it down, lower brightness, etc., which seems reasonable because they're sharing a bedroom. \n\nThen there's the ASMR part, specifically whispering ASMR. The author has misophonia, which makes whispering uncomfortable for them. They showed the boyfriend a study about this, and he responded by putting in earphones. That seems like a reasonable compromise. The boyfriend's reaction might be a bit abrupt, but he did take the hint and adjusted his behavior. \n\nThe key points here are: the author has a valid reason (misophonia) for being bothered by the ASMR, they've communicated their needs, and the boyfriend made an effort to accommodate. The author is not being unreasonable by setting boundaries in their shared living space, especially regarding noise and light that affect sleep. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being considered, but the author's health and comfort are also important. It's a matter of mutual adjustment. Since the author is clearly communicating their needs and the boyfriend is making an effort, it doesn't seem like the author is in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
