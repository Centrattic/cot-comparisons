I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness at night. The boyfriend's bedtime involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable due to misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR. The author has explained their feelings and even shown a study, and the boyfriend responds by using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid health issue\u2014misophonia\u2014so their discomfort isn't just about being picky. They're trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend is trying to have his own bedtime routine, which is also normal. But when the author asks him to adjust, he complies by using earphones. That seems like a compromise. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and compromise. The author is expressing their needs and making the boyfriend aware of their condition. They haven't forbidden him from doing his routine entirely, just during their sleep time. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he's willing to accommodate. \n\nHowever, the author is constantly asking for adjustments, which might be irritating. But given the health aspect, it's not just about annoyance. The boyfriend's actions show he's making an effort. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution that respects both their needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their requests, and the boyfriend is responding appropriately. The answer should be B.\n"
