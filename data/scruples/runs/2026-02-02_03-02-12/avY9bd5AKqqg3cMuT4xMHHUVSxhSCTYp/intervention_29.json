I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep. The key points here are about respecting each other's needs and communication.\n\nFirst, the author mentions needing silence and darkness for sleep, which is a common requirement. They've allowed the boyfriend to use his laptop but it's still bothering them. They ask him to lower the sound and brightness, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which he's attached to. The author has a specific issue with whispering ASMR due to misophonia, a condition that causes distress from certain sounds. They showed him a study explaining this, and he responded by using earphones.\n\nFrom what I know, misophonia is a real condition where specific sounds trigger negative emotions. If the author has this, their sensitivity is legitimate. They're trying to communicate their needs, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction of putting in earphones after being shown the study suggests he's making an effort, which is positive. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting these boundaries. Generally, in relationships, partners are expected to accommodate each other's needs as long as it's reasonable. Asking to turn down the volume and brightness isn't unreasonable, especially when it's affecting health (in this case, the author's ability to sleep due to misophonia). The author isn't banning all of his activities but is asking for adjustments to coexist comfortably.\n\nThe boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being respected, but the author has a valid health-related reason. It's about mutual respect and finding a balance. Since the author is communicating their needs and the boyfriend is making some adjustments, it seems like a healthy dynamic. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're addressing a specific issue that impacts their well-being. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their health needs and making reasonable requests to maintain a peaceful living environment.\n"
