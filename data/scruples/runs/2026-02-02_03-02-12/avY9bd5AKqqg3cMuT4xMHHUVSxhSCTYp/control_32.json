I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine where he uses his laptop for YouTube, ASMR, or just general use. The author's bedtime routine is the opposite: they need silence and darkness. The author has been asking the boyfriend to lower the volume, brightness, etc., but the boyfriend doesn't seem happy about it. The main issue is the ASMR, especially whispering ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable due to what they call misophonia. They showed a study to the boyfriend, who then put on earphones. Now the author is asking if they're in the wrong for asking these accommodations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is asking their partner to adjust their habits because of their own sensitivity. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's ability to sleep, which is a basic need. The author mentions that the boyfriend's ASMR, particularly whispering, causes them anxiety and discomfort. They provided evidence from a study, which the boyfriend reacted to by using earphones. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. Even if the boyfriend isn't fully aware of the specifics, the author's distress is valid. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is important in a relationship. However, the boyfriend might feel his needs are being ignored. But since they live together, the author's need for a good night's sleep is also important.\n\nI should also consider if the author is being reasonable. They are asking for adjustments that are within the boyfriend's control, like volume and brightness. The boyfriend's response was to put on earphones, which suggests he tried to accommodate. However, the author might still be bothered by the laptop's brightness. But the main issue is the ASMR, which he's using earphones for. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they are asserting their needs, especially when their health is affected. \n\nAnother angle: relationships require compromise. The author's needs are valid, and so is the boyfriend's need for his bedtime routine. But since they live together, the author's needs might take precedence because lack of sleep affects overall health. The boyfriend is making some adjustments (earphones), but maybe the author needs to communicate more effectively or find a solution together, like using a separate room for the laptop or a white noise machine. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is clearly communicating their discomfort and the boyfriend is making some effort, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend might be the one who needs to adjust more, but the author's actions here are about protecting their own well-being. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
