I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The author is a partner who lives with their boyfriend and is asking him to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption before bed because it's affecting their sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable due to misophonia, especially with whispering. They've shown him a study, and he puts earphones in, but the author still feels they need to ask him repeatedly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple just moved in together, so establishing boundaries is part of that transition. The author has a specific need for silence and darkness, which is important for their well-being. Misophonia is a recognized condition, and if the author has that, their reaction to certain sounds is legitimate. They've tried to communicate this and even provided evidence through a study, which shows they're trying to be understanding and scientific about it.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is to put on earphones, which is a reasonable compromise, but the author still feels they have to keep asking. Maybe the issue is that the boyfriend isn't fully respecting the author's needs, or maybe the author is not acknowledging that the boyfriend has his own needs. But the key point is that the author is advocating for their own comfort in their shared living space. Since they live together, both need to adjust to each other's habits. It's a balance. The author isn't just being difficult; they have valid reasons related to a medical condition. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and putting on earphones) suggests he's trying to comply but perhaps not enough. The author's persistence in asking could be seen as necessary for their well-being, not unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are based on a genuine need, and they've made efforts to communicate and find solutions. The boyfriend's pleasure (ASMR) is getting met, but the author's health and sleep are also important. The author's requests are reasonable in a shared living situation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
