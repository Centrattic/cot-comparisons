I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop volume and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially regarding ASMR content. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author has moved in with their boyfriend and has different bedtime needs. They require silence and darkness, so they're asking him to lower the volume and brightness. The boyfriend's routine includes watching YouTube or listening to ASMR, which he enjoys. The author has misophonia, particularly triggered by whispering in ASMR, leading to anxiety and discomfort.\n\nI should consider what misophonia is. It's a condition where certain sounds cause strong negative reactions. The author showed a study to their partner, which he responded to by using earphones. That seems like a reasonable compromise. However, the boyfriend might feel his preferences are being ignored, leading to tension. \n\nThe key points are: the author's health and comfort (due to misophonia) versus the boyfriend's preferences. Since the author is asking for adjustments to their shared living environment to accommodate a medical condition, it's reasonable. The boyfriend's use of earphones shows he's trying to comply. \n\nBut maybe there's an imbalance if the author is constantly nagging or if the boyfriend isn't making enough effort. However, given the medical aspect, the author's needs are valid. The boyfriend's initial resistance might be due to not understanding the severity, but once informed, he made a change. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Based on the information, since they're addressing a health issue and seeking a solution (like earphones), the author isn't being unreasonable. The boyfriend's discomfort might be valid too, but the author's health takes precedence. So the answer is likely B (Not the asshole).\n"
