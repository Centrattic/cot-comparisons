I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage when they're trying to sleep. The main points here are about the author's sensitivity to ASMR, particularly whispering, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They mention having misophonia, which is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple just moved in together, so there's a new living arrangement to navigate. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, which the author finds disruptive because of the noise and brightness. The author has explained their feelings and even shared research about their condition. The boyfriend's reaction is to avoid the author and use earphones, which suggests he's trying to comply.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for making these requests. The key here is whether their requests are reasonable. Since they have a medical condition that's affecting their well-being, it's important to accommodate that. The boyfriend isn't being asked to give up his habits entirely but to adjust them in a shared living space, especially when it's impacting someone else's health.\n\nI should also think about mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should consider each other's needs. The author is communicating their needs clearly and providing evidence of their condition, which shows they're trying to be understanding and collaborative. The boyfriend's response seems to be avoiding conflict by putting on earphones, which is a reasonable compromise.\n\nThere's no indication that the author is being overly controlling or unreasonable. They're setting boundaries to maintain their health, which is valid. The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might make him feel defensive, but the author's focus is on their well-being, not on criticizing his choices. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason based on their condition and are making reasonable requests in a shared living situation. The answer should be B.\n"
