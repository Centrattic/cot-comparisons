I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage during bedtime. The main points are about the author needing silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses the laptop with ASMR and bright screen. The author explains their discomfort, mentions misophonia related to whispering ASMR, and provided a study to their partner. The boyfriend reacts by putting on earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for a sleep-conducive environment. It's reasonable to ask for adjustments in a shared living space. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author's sensitivity to certain sounds like whispering ASMR is a legitimate issue. They tried to communicate this and provided evidence, which shows they're trying to be understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he enjoys. However, when living together, both partners need to make compromises. The author's requests are specific and not overly demanding\u2014like lowering volume and brightness. The boyfriend's reaction of putting on earphones suggests he's trying to comply but maybe not fully understanding the depth of the author's discomfort.\n\nIs the author being inconsiderate? They are making reasonable requests based on their health and well-being. It's part of cohabitation to adjust for each other's needs. The author isn't banning all activities but asking for adjustments that don't interfere with the boyfriend's routine significantly. The fact that they discussed it and provided information shows they're trying to find a middle ground. The boyfriend's irritation might be his issue, but the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries for their own rest. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
