I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits when they move in together. The main points are that the author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds irritating, especially whispering ASMR due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, moving in together often involves compromising on habits. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. They mentioned letting him watch his stuff but still have to ask for adjustments. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones might indicate he's trying to accommodate, but the author feels it's not enough.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition, and the author provided research to explain their discomfort. This adds weight to their request. However, communication is key. The author might be coming across as nagging if they're asking every night without considering the boyfriend's needs. They need to find a balance that works for both, like using earphones or adjusting the laptop's brightness/sound.\n\nThe boyfriend might feel his habits are being criticized, leading to tension. The author's approach could be seen as necessary for their well-being, but the method (constantly reminding) might be stressful. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs. Since the author is trying to explain their situation with evidence and the boyfriend is making some adjustments, the author isn't in the wrong. They need to continue communication and perhaps find a middle ground, like specific times for his routine or using earphones.\n"
