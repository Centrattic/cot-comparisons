I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if they're the asshole for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness at night because it's affecting their sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable, especially the whispering ASMR, which they have misophonia for.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid health issue (misophonia) that causes anxiety and discomfort when hearing certain sounds like whispering. They've communicated this to their partner and even showed him a study. The boyfriend's reaction was to roll away and use earphones, which seems like he's trying to accommodate. \n\nThe author is asking for adjustments that are reasonable\u2014lowering volume, brightness, using earphones. These are common requests in shared living situations. The problem arises when the boyfriend's actions are still causing distress despite the requests. The author is prioritizing their health and comfort, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his preferences are being ignored, but the author's requests are for their well-being. The fact that the author tried to educate the boyfriend about their condition shows they're trying to be understanding. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they're addressing a legitimate issue that affects their mental health. They\u2019re making reasonable accommodations, and the boyfriend's response suggests he's making efforts too. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're advocating for their needs in a shared living space.\n"
