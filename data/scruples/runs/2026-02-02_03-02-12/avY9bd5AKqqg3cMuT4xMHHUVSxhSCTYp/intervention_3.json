I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits so they can sleep. The author mentions that the boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness on, which disrupts their sleep. They also have an issue with ASMR, especially whispering, due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has just moved in together, so establishing boundaries is part of that transition. The author's need for silence and darkness is reasonable for their bedtime routine. It's common for people to have different preferences, and adjusting to each other's needs is part of a healthy relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's habits involve ASMR, which he seems to enjoy. However, the author's sensitivity to whispering ASMR causes them anxiety and discomfort. They provided research to explain their condition, which shows they're trying to communicate their needs effectively. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's making an effort, which is positive.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is being unreasonable. They're asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being, not just preference. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author's reaction to whispering ASMR is a legitimate health issue. It's important that both partners respect each other's needs without making the other feel guilty.\n\nHowever, there might be a balance. The author should also consider the boyfriend's needs. Maybe they can find a compromise, like using different rooms for bedtime routines or using white noise machines. But based on the information given, the author is not overstepping; they're addressing a valid issue affecting their health. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure shouldn't make the author feel wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they're advocating for their health and well-being, and they're trying to communicate their needs respectfully. The boyfriend's reaction indicates he's trying to accommodate, which shows mutual respect. There's no indication the author is being unreasonable or inconsiderate beyond their necessary adjustments.\n"
