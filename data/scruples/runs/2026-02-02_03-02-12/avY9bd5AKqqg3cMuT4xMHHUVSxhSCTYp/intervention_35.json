I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits when they're trying to sleep. The author mentions having misophonia, especially towards whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They also explain that they showed their boyfriend a study about it, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is trying to create a sleep environment that's dark and quiet, which is their personal need. The boyfriend has his own nighttime routine involving screens and audio, which is causing conflict. The author's requests are specific: lower volume, brightness, maybe use headphones. They also mention that the boyfriend doesn't like these requests, but the author is standing their ground because of their sensitivity.\n\nNow, considering misophonia is a recognized condition, even if it's not fully understood medically. If the author has a legitimate sensitivity that causes physical and emotional discomfort, their requests are about their health and well-being. The boyfriend, while having his own preferences, should be accommodating if possible. However, the author is living in the same space, so mutual adjustments are necessary.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones after being shown the study seems like a positive step. Maybe he's trying to accommodate. But the author is still having to ask repeatedly. Is that reasonable? In a shared living situation, both parties need to make compromises. The author isn't asking for the boyfriend to stop entirely, just to reduce volume and brightness, which are reasonable requests.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are within their rights. Since they have a documented sensitivity and are communicating their needs, they're not unreasonable. The boyfriend, while possibly frustrated, isn't being asked to give up his routine entirely but to make minor adjustments that respect the author's needs. The author isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for their own well-being. The boyfriend might need to find alternative ways to enjoy ASMR without disturbing the author, like using headphones. The situation is about both parties finding a balance, but the author's stance is justified given their health.\n"
