I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend who just moved in together. The author is disturbed by the boyfriend's use of a laptop at night with ASMR, especially whispering ASMR, which causes her anxiety and discomfort due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is making requests for him to adjust volume, brightness, etc., which he doesn't like. She's also informed him about her misophonia, showed a study, and he responds by putting in earphones. Is she being reasonable here?\n\nWell, when people live together, they have to compromise on their habits, especially when they affect each other. The author is clearly communicating her needs, which is important. Misophonia is a real condition that can cause significant distress, so her sensitivity to whispering ASMR isn't just a personal preference\u2014it's a medical issue. She's done her part by explaining and showing evidence, which shows effort to be understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is also trying to have his bedtime routine. However, since they're sharing a living space, especially a bedroom, the reasonable thing is to adjust so that both can be comfortable. The author isn't forbidding him from doing it entirely; she's asking for adjustments that would mitigate the disturbance. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply, which is a good sign. But maybe there's a need for further discussion on how to balance both their needs, perhaps using headphones or finding a time difference.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is overstepping. Since she's communicating her needs calmly and providing a reason (misophonia), and the boyfriend is trying to comply, it seems like she's in the right. The boyfriend might need to be more accommodating, but the author isn't wrong for standing up for her needs. The answer should be B.\n"
