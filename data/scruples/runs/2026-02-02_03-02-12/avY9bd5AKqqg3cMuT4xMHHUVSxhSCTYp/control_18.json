I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their behavior towards their boyfriend regarding his laptop use and ASMR at night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend's bedtime involves using his laptop for YouTube, ASMR, or similar. The author asks him to adjust the sound and brightness, which he dislikes. The main issue is the ASMR, especially whispering, which the author has misophonia towards. The author showed a study about misophonia and ASMR, and the boyfriend responded by putting in earphones.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is trying to get a good night's sleep, which is a valid need. Misophonia is a real condition, and ASMR's whispering can trigger negative reactions. However, the boyfriend's needs are also important. The author is asking him to modify his routine, which he might find annoying or restrictive.\n\nKey points: The author has a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that's affecting their sleep. They communicated their needs and even provided research, which the boyfriend acknowledged by using earphones. However, the author's constant requests might be seen as nagging, which could strain the relationship. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) shows he's trying to accommodate, but maybe the author is not giving him enough credit for that effort.\n\nOn the other hand, living together requires compromise. If the author is always making demands without considering the boyfriend's preferences, that could be a problem. But given the health aspect, it's reasonable to prioritize their well-being. The boyfriend isn't inconsiderate\u2014he's using earphones. The author might need to find a middle ground, like using a white noise machine or separate bedding if necessary, but the initial requests don't seem unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a valid health reason and are trying to communicate their needs. The boyfriend is also making adjustments. However, the author should consider if their approach is causing unnecessary conflict. But based on the information given, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
