I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop settings and ASMR habits when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, especially towards whispering ASMR. They explain that it causes anxiety and discomfort. They've shown their boyfriend a study about this, and he responded by putting in earphones. So he seems to be making an effort.\n\nThe boyfriend's bedtime routine includes watching YouTube or ASMR, which conflicts with the author's need for silence and darkness. They moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The author is communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about it, but he's complying when asked. \n\nIs the author being too demanding? Well, they're not asking for him to stop entirely but to adjust the volume, brightness, and maybe use headphones. It's reasonable to want your space when sleeping. The key here is mutual respect. The author is expressing their discomfort and finding a solution that works for both. They're also educating the boyfriend on their condition, which shows consideration. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014indicates he's not resisting entirely. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. It's about cohabitation and compromise. The answer should be B.\n"
