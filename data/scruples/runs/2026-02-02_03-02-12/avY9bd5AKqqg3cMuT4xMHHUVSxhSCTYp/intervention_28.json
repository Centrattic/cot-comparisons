I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if someone who is asking their boyfriend to lower the laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep is the asshole. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, but the author is sensitive to whispering ASMR and finds it uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a different bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness. They communicate their needs by asking the boyfriend to adjust his behavior. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about it but complies, like putting on earphones. The author mentions they even showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, which caused him to roll away.\n\nNow, misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative emotional reactions. The author isn't just being picky; there's a physiological discomfort. They're trying to accommodate the boyfriend's habits but are struggling with the effects it has on them. On the other side, the boyfriend has a preference for ASMR, which he uses as a guilt trip, maybe. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for their well-being.\n\nThe question is whether asking for these adjustments is unreasonable. Since they live together, both should accommodate each other's needs. The author is communicating their needs clearly and providing reasons, which shows consideration. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he's aware but not entirely happy, but he still makes changes. It seems like a reasonable compromise. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're trying to coexist. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
