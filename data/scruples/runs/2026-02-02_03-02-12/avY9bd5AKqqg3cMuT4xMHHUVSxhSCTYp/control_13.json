I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially when he listens to ASMR which makes them anxious. They mention they have misophonia specifically to whispering ASMR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a new living situation and has a bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness. Their partner's habits are conflicting with that. The author is communicating their discomfort, which seems reasonable. They provided evidence of a study about misophonia and ASMR, which validates their feelings. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he enjoys. The question is whether the author is overstepping. But given that the author is expressing a genuine medical condition (misophonia), which is causing them distress, it seems like a legitimate request. The author isn't banning ASMR entirely but is asking for adjustments that don't harm the boyfriend's habits (like using headphones). \n\nThe key points here are communication and accommodation. The author is asking for things that are reasonable and the boyfriend is making efforts to comply. The author isn't being unreasonable; they\u2019re addressing a specific issue that affects their well-being. So, the answer should be B (No) because the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
