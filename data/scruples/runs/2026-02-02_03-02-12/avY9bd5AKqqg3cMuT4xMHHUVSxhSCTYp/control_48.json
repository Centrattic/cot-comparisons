I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their boyfriend have different bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube, ASMR, or other activities. The author keeps asking him to lower the sound and brightness, and when he listens to ASMR, especially whispering, the author gets really uncomfortable because of misophonia. They showed him a study about this, and he used earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a shared living situation. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. The author has a valid health concern here. But at the same time, the boyfriend has his own habits for winding down. The author is asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being, which seems fair. They also tried to explain the issue with the study, which is a good step. The boyfriend's response was to put in earphones, which is a reasonable compromise. The author is asking for things that don't seem excessive\u2014lowering volume and brightness, using headphones. It's about respecting each other's needs. If the author is causing the boyfriend discomfort by asking, maybe there's a communication issue, but the core request is about mutual respect for their differing needs. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
