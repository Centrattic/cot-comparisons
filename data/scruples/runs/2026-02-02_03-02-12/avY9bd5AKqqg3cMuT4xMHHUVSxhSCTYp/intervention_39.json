I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about living with a boyfriend and having different bedtime needs. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with sounds and maybe ASMR. The author asks him to adjust the volume and brightness and even showed a study about misophonia related to whispering ASMR. The boyfriend reacts by using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a quiet and dark environment to sleep. Misophonia is a real condition, and the study they mentioned might support their sensitivity to certain sounds like whispering ASMR. It's reasonable for the author to communicate their discomfort and ask for adjustments to their shared living space.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine, which he might find necessary for relaxing. However, when living together, especially in a bedroom shared with a partner, it's important to accommodate each other's needs. The boyfriend's reaction of putting on earphones after the author explained the study seems like a positive step towards resolving the issue. It shows he's willing to adjust.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The author is clearly communicating their needs and providing information to help the boyfriend understand. The boyfriend is making changes to accommodate those needs. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable or that their requests are excessive. They are not forbidding him from his activities entirely but asking for modifications that don't interfere with their sleep.\n\nI don't see any evidence that the author is in the wrong. They're advocating for their own well-being, which is important. The boyfriend's adjustment (using earphones) suggests that a compromise is possible. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
