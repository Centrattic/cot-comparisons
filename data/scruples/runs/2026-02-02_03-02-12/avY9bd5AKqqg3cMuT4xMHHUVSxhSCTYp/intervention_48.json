I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's volume and brightness at night because they need silence and darkness for sleep. The boyfriend listens to ASMR, which the author has a sensitivity (misophonia) towards, especially whispering. The author shared a study about it, and the boyfriend complied by using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for a sleep-conducive environment. Misophonia is a real condition, and if ASMR triggers their anxiety, that's a legitimate health concern. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is causing discomfort, so the author is setting boundaries to protect their well-being. Communication is key here, and the author has tried to explain their feelings and provide evidence (the study), which the boyfriend respected by using earphones. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being considered. However, the author is not banning him from doing ASMR entirely but asking for adjustments to minimize disturbance. The boyfriend's compliance suggests he respects her boundaries. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the boyfriend could use in-ear headphones or move to another room. But the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their health and sleep. The fact that he's a new roommate adds to the sensitivity of the situation, but the author is reasonable in their requests. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
