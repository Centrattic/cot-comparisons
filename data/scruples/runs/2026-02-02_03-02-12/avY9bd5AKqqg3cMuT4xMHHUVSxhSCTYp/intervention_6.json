I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's boyfriend using his laptop in bed at night, which disturbs her sleep because she needs silence and darkness. She has to ask him to lower the volume and brightness, and especially when he listens to whispering ASMR, which she has misophonia towards.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author is in a new living situation with her boyfriend. They have conflicting bedtime routines. She's clear about her needs, and he's aware of them. She's trying to communicate her discomfort, even showing him a study about her misophonia. He reacts by putting in earphones, which suggests he's making an effort to accommodate her.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions are causing her distress, which is affecting her sleep and mental health. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for cohabitation. The question is whether her requests are reasonable. Since she's communicating her needs and he's making efforts, it seems like she's not in the wrong. Misophonia is a real condition, and her reaction is legitimate. The boyfriend should respect her boundaries, even if it's inconvenient for him.\n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because she's advocating for her well-being and has communicated her needs clearly. The boyfriend should adjust his habits to accommodate her, especially since they live together now. It's a matter of mutual respect and compromise in a shared living space.\n"
