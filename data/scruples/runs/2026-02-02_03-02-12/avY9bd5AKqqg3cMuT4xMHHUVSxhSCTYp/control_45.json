I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop with sound and brightness on while they're trying to sleep, and the author asking him to adjust it. The boyfriend's main thing is ASMR, especially whispering, which the author has misophonia and finds really annoying.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and boyfriend just moved in together. The author needs a quiet and dark environment to sleep, while the boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop with ASMR. The author asks him to lower the sound, brightness, etc., which the boyfriend doesn't seem happy with. The author also explained their misophonia and showed a study, leading the boyfriend to use earphones.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. So, considering that the author is advocating for their own comfort and health (since misophonia is a real condition), they have a valid reason to ask for adjustments. The boyfriend is using the laptop in a way that affects the author's sleep, which is a basic need. However, the author is making repeated requests, which might be seen as nagging, but given the health aspect, it's understandable. The boyfriend's response of using earphones is a reasonable compromise. \n\nI should also consider that they're in a new living situation, so establishing boundaries is important. The author isn't forbidding the boyfriend from his activities entirely, just asking him to modify them to accommodate their needs. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is the ASMR, but the author's health and sleep are also important. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're addressing a legitimate issue with a health component, and the boyfriend's adjustment (using earphones) shows he's making an effort. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
