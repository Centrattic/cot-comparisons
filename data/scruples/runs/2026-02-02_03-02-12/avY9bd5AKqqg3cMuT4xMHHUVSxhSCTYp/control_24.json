I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening habits during bedtime. The boyfriend's routine involves watching YouTube, using a laptop, and listening to ASMR, which the author finds disruptive. The author has specific issues with the brightness, sound, and especially whispering ASMR, which they have misophonia towards.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their living situation. They just moved in together, so establishing boundaries is part of adjusting. The author's need for silence and darkness is valid for their sleep, which is important for health. They are communicating their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's habits are causing discomfort, so asking him to adjust isn't unreasonable. The author mentions explaining the research on misophonia, which shows they're trying to educate him, not just be difficult.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014might indicate he's trying to accommodate. The author is persistent in asking for adjustments, but is that overstepping? It depends on balance. If the boyfriend is willing to make changes without resentment, maybe it's okay. But if the author is nagging, it could become a problem. The key here is communication and mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially regarding health issues like misophonia. However, they might need to find a middle ground. Since the boyfriend is making efforts, the author isn't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
