I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits to accommodate their sensitivity. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, specifically triggered by whispering ASMR. They show a study to their boyfriend, and he responds by using earphones. That seems like a reasonable compromise. \n\nThey moved in together, so adjusting to each other's routines is part of a relationship. The author's need for silence and darkness is legitimate. Asking to turn down the laptop and brightness is about creating a shared environment that works for both. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to respect their requests. The author isn't demanding the boyfriend to stop all activities; they're just asking for adjustments. \n\nIt's about mutual respect. The author communicating their discomfort and finding a solution isn't being inconsiderate. The boyfriend's actions show he's making an effort. So, the author isn't the one at fault here.\n"
