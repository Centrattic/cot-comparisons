I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author and their boyfriend living together. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop for YouTube or ASMR, especially whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards. The author asks him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., and showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR. The boyfriend reacts by rolling away and using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that makes certain sounds, like whispering ASMR, uncomfortable. They are communicating their needs to their partner. The boyfriend's habits are causing distress, and the author is trying to mitigate that. The move-in situation adds a layer of shared living space, so both need to adjust. The author is making reasonable requests (lowering volume, brightness, using earphones), which are not extreme. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he complies, which is positive, but maybe the author feels it's not enough. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're advocating for their health and well-being, it's justified. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but the author's needs are valid. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're setting boundaries. The boyfriend should be accommodating. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
