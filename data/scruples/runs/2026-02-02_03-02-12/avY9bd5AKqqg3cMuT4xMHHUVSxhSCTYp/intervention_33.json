I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's brightness and volume because it's affecting her sleep. She also mentions she has misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which she finds really irritating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, probably with some noise and light. The author needs silence and darkness. She's been asking him to adjust, which he doesn't seem happy about. She showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he responded by using earphones.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. She's trying to maintain her own comfort and health by asking him to accommodate her needs. Misophonia is a real condition, and it's mentioned that there's research supporting her reaction. She's not just being picky; there's a medical basis here. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own preferences. But moving in together usually means some compromise. The author is making reasonable requests that don't seem extreme\u2014lowering volume and brightness, using earphones. Those are common adjustments in shared living spaces.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and put on earphones, which might be his way of avoiding conflict. But he's not engaging in a dialogue about how they can both meet their needs. The author is upfront about her discomfort and even provided evidence. She hasn't said he can't watch ASMR, just that she can't handle it when it's directed at her. That seems fair.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could use separate rooms or headphones, but the author is already asking for adjustments. Since the issue is his specific type of ASMR (whispering), maybe using earphones is the solution. The author isn't banning his activities entirely, just modifying them to coexist in the same space. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are about respecting her own health and the living arrangement. She's making clear requests and explaining her reasons. The boyfriend's guilt about his pleasure (ASMR) suggests he might be aware it's a problem, but not taking active steps to adjust. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are justified for her well-being, and she's communicated her needs. The boyfriend's reluctance to adjust might be the issue here, but the question is about the author's position. The answer should be B (No).\n"
