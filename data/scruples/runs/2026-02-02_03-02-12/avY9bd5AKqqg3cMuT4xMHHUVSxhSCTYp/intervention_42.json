I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the boyfriend's bedtime habits conflicting with the author's need for silence and darkness. The author asks him to turn down the laptop's sound and brightness, and also expresses discomfort with ASMR, especially whispering, which triggers their misophonia. They showed him a study about it, and he used earphones after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason because their health is affected\u2014misophonia is a real condition that causes anxiety and distress from certain sounds. They moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The boyfriend's actions are within his rights to enjoy ASMR, but they're impacting the author's well-being. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to ask for accommodations? Yes, because they need a restful environment. The boyfriend, upon being informed about the study and the author's discomfort, did take steps to mitigate the issue by using earphones. That shows he's trying to accommodate. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're asking for adjustments that are necessary for their mental health. \n\nOn the flip side, could the boyfriend adjust without causing conflict? He might feel that his preferences are being restricted, but since they live together, mutual adjustments are expected. The author isn't banning all ASMR, just the specific types that trigger their misophonia. They're also asking for volume and brightness adjustments, which are standard in shared living spaces.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They're asserting their needs for a healthy living environment, and the boyfriend is making efforts to comply. Therefore, answer B.\n"
