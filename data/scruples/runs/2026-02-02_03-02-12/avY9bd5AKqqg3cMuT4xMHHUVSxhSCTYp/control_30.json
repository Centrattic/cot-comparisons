I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author and their boyfriend have different bedtime routines. He uses his laptop with YouTube or ASMR, which she finds disruptive. She has to ask him to lower the volume, dim the screen, etc. The main issue is her misophonia triggered by whispering ASMR, making her anxious and uncomfortable. She shared a study about it, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key factors here are mutual respect, communication, and finding compromise. The author is setting boundaries for her well-being, which is reasonable. Misophonia is a real condition, so her sensitivity isn't just being difficult. However, she's moving in together, so they need to find a solution that works for both. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate her. But maybe she's not considering his needs? If she's constantly asking without considering his habits, maybe there's a balance to find. However, since she's communicating her needs and he's making adjustments, it seems like both are trying. The fact that she's explaining her condition and showing the study shows she's trying to be understanding. So, unless she's being overly demanding without any compromise on her part, she's probably not in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because she's advocating for her health and he's adjusting. But I need to make sure there's no indication she's being unreasonable. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, so maybe he's not fully cooperative, but the question is about the author. Since she's trying to communicate and he's responding, she's not the asshole.\n"
