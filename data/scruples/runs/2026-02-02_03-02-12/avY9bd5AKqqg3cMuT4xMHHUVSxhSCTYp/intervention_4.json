I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR during their bedtime routine. The author mentions they need silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend has a different routine involving YouTube, ASMR, etc. The author has tried to communicate their discomfort, even showing a study about misophonia related to ASMR. The boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and use earphones.\n\nFirst, the author is trying to accommodate their own needs without completely restricting the boyfriend's habits. They're asking him to adjust the volume, brightness, and maybe even the type of ASMR. The boyfriend does comply by using earphones, which suggests he's making an effort. The author isn't demanding an outright ban but is setting boundaries for their comfort. They also shared a study to explain their feelings, which is a reasonable step to help the boyfriend understand.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, mutual adjustments are expected. The author is not being unreasonable here. They're clearly communicating their needs, which is important for a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's actions after being informed indicate he respects those boundaries. There's no indication that the author is being overly controlling or dismissive of the boyfriend's needs. Instead, they're seeking a compromise that allows both to have a comfortable sleep environment.\n\nThe key points are communication, mutual adjustment, and respect. The author isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for their own well-being and have made efforts to explain their situation. The boyfriend's response shows he's making an effort as well. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
