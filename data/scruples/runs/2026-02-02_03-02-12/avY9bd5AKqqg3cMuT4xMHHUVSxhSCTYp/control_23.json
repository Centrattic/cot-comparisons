I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend and girlfriend who have different bedtime routines. The girlfriend needs silence and darkness to sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with sounds, especially ASMR, which the girlfriend says makes her anxious and unsettled because of misophonia. She's been asking him to adjust his behavior, and he's been rolling over or using earphones. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what misophonia is. From what I know, it's a condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotions or physiological reactions. The author mentions a study linking ASMR and misophonia, which suggests that the sounds that are relaxing for some can be distressing for others with misophonia. That's a key point here.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's actions are causing her distress, and she's communicated her needs to him. He's made some adjustments, like using earphones. The question is whether her being assertive about her needs makes her the asshole. \n\nIn relationships, communication is important. If one person's habits are affecting the other's well-being, it's reasonable for them to ask for changes. The boyfriend is within his rights to enjoy ASMR, but in a shared living space, especially when they're in bed together, mutual adjustments are necessary. The author isn't being aggressive, just asking for accommodations. The boyfriend's immediate reaction of rolling away and using earphones shows he's responsive to her requests. \n\nHowever, I should consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe they could find times when the boyfriend can listen to ASMR without disturbing her, like using earphones consistently and ensuring the laptop's brightness isn't too high. But the author's actions are about her health and well-being, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe key here is that the author has explained her medical condition (misophonia) and provided a study to support her feelings, which shows she's tried to be understanding and communicative. The boyfriend's response has been to comply, which is positive. \n\nSo, the author isn't unreasonable here. She's asking for reasonable accommodations in their shared living space. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
