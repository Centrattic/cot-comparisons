I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, and specifically for expressing that ASMR makes them anxious. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple just moved in together, and the boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop for YouTube or ASMR. The author needs silence and darkness for their own routine. They've asked him to adjust the volume and brightness, which he does, but they still feel uncomfortable when he listens to whispering ASMR. They even showed him a study about misophonia, which he reacted to by putting in earphones.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author is asking for adjustments to their shared living space to accommodate their sleep needs, which is legitimate. They have a specific sensitivity (misophonia) that causes them anxiety from certain sounds like whispering. They provided evidence of this condition to the boyfriend, who then complied by using earphones. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The boyfriend's actions might be a personal preference, but the author's well-being is also important. Living together often requires compromise. The author is clearly communicating their needs, which the boyfriend meets by using earphones. The author isn't outright banning his ASMR, just asking for it to be done in a way that doesn't disturb them. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel his habits are being restricted, but the author's requests are reasonable and considerate. The author isn't being overly controlling; they're setting boundaries to coexist peacefully. Since the boyfriend adjusted his behavior after understanding the issue, it seems like a mutual effort. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author is advocating for their own comfort in a shared space, especially with a valid medical condition mentioned. It's about finding a solution that works for both, and the boyfriend has made accommodations. The author isn't the asshole here.\n"
