I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits so they can sleep better. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness, and specifically listens to ASMR with whispering, which the author has misophonia towards.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, which is a real condition where certain sounds cause discomfort. They provided a study to support their feelings. That's important because it's not just about noise but a specific sensitivity. The boyfriend moved in together, so shared living spaces require compromise. The author is asking for adjustments that are reasonable\u2014lowering volume, brightness, using earphones. These are common requests in shared spaces. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he might be avoiding the issue instead of addressing the problem. The author is clear about their needs and explained their condition, which shows they're not being unreasonable. It's about coexistence in a shared environment. The key here is mutual respect and accommodation. The author isn't forbidding him from his activities entirely but is asking for adjustments that allow both to sleep. \n\nSo, considering the health aspect (misophonia) and the practical need for a peaceful sleep environment, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend should be accommodating unless there's a valid reason not to, but the scenario doesn't indicate that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
