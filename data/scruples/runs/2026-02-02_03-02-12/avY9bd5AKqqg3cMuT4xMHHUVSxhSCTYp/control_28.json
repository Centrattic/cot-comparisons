I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage to accommodate their need for silence and darkness at bedtime.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend's routine involves using his laptop, which includes watching YouTube or ASMR. The author needs a quiet, dark environment to sleep. They've tried asking him to lower the volume, brightness, and other adjustments. The boyfriend uses ASMR, which the author has a misophonia reaction to, especially with whispering. The author showed a study about this to the boyfriend, who then used earphones.\n\nNow, considering both sides: The author has a legitimate health concern (misophonia) that affects their well-being. They're communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has his own routine and preferences. However, moving in together means both need to compromise. The author isn't just being a bother; they have a medical reason. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) shows he's making an effort. \n\nIs the author being too much? They're not forbidding ASMR entirely, just asking for adjustments to protect their health. The boyfriend's discomfort might come from the constant reminders, but the author's needs are valid. It's a balance of mutual respect. The key here is that the author isn't the problem because they're addressing a health issue and making reasonable requests. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from frustration but doesn't negate the author's right to a good sleep environment. So the answer is B.\n"
