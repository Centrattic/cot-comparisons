I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. They moved in together, and the boyfriend has a bedtime routine involving his laptop, including ASMR. The author needs silence and darkness. They've asked him to lower the sound and brightness, which bothers him. The main issue is the ASMR, specifically whispering, which causes the author misophonia-like symptoms. The author showed a study about this, and the boyfriend responded by using earphones.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is asking for their needs to be respected, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's well-being. Misophonia is a recognized condition, even if not fully understood. The author is communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and putting on earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate, but the author feels they have to keep reminding him, which might indicate he's not fully respecting their boundaries.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're advocating for their health and comfort. However, maybe they could approach it with more empathy. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. The boyfriend isn't respecting their needs if he's not consistently adjusting his behavior. The author isn't the asshole here. So the answer should be B.\n"
