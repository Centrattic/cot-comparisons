I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple moving in together, and the author is asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's volume and brightness so they can sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube, listening to ASMR, etc. The author mentions misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is trying to communicate their needs for a good night's sleep, which is important for their well-being. The boyfriend's habits are causing distress, and the author is setting boundaries. There's a mention of showing a study to the boyfriend, which he reacted to by putting in earphones. \n\nNow, considering the context, when two people move in together, they have to adjust to each other's routines. The author isn't outright banning the boyfriend's habits but is asking for adjustments that don't interfere with their own needs. The boyfriend's actions are affecting someone else's health (misophonia is a real condition), so the author is justified in asking for accommodations. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his own needs are being ignored. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're trying to communicate and find a compromise (like adjusting volume, brightness, using earphones), it seems reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply, which supports the author's efforts.\n\nThe key factors here are communication, mutual respect, and health. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing a specific issue that affects their well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
