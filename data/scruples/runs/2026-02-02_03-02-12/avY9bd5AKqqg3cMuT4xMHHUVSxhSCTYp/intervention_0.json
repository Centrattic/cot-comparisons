I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use when they're trying to sleep. The main issue here is about differing needs and sensitivities. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend uses ASMR and his laptop at night.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. They've just moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The author has communicated their discomfort about the laptop's brightness and sound, which is reasonable. They even mentioned having misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which is a legitimate sensitivity. Providing the study shows they tried to explain their condition, and the boyfriend responded by putting on earphones, which is a positive step.\n\nBut is the author overstepping? Well, the boyfriend has a bedtime routine he enjoys, but the author's health and well-being (due to misophonia) are also important. The key here is mutual respect. The author is asking for reasonable adjustments that don't completely take away the boyfriend's ability to relax. The boyfriend using earphones suggests he's making an effort, so the author's requests seem justified.\n\nHowever, could there be a balance? Maybe the author hasn't offered alternative solutions, like using a different room or specific times. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author has a medical sensitivity and is communicating their needs, especially after providing evidence, it's more about the boyfriend needing to accommodate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
