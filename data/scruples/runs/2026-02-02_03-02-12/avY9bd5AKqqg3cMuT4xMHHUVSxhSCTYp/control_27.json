I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their boyfriend just moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop with YouTube, ASMR, or other activities. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep, so they ask him to turn down the sound and brightness, maybe cover it up, etc. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about these requests. The author also mentions that they have a specific issue with whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort, and they showed the boyfriend a study about this. The boyfriend then uses earphones, but the author still feels they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is setting boundaries for their own well-being. They need a quiet, dark environment to sleep, which is a reasonable request. The boyfriend's habits are affecting their sleep, which is important for health. The author is communicating their needs, which is a positive step. They even provided evidence (the study) to explain their sensitivity, which shows they're trying to understand and explain the issue clearly.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's response (rolling away and putting in earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not fully understanding the extent of the problem. The author might be frustrated because even with adjustments, the issue isn't fully resolved. However, the author is consistent in their requests, which is necessary if their sleep is being disrupted. It's important to consider that chronic sleep disruption can have serious health effects, so the author's need is significant.\n\nIs the author being reasonable? They're asking for adjustments that are within the boyfriend's control. Lowering the volume and brightness shouldn't be too much to ask. Using earphones is a step, but if the author is still disturbed, maybe there's a need for further adjustments, like moving to a different room or using a white noise machine. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for making these requests.\n\nThe boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, which he might be attached to. The author is asking him to give up part of that, which could be a point of conflict. However, in a shared living space, mutual adjustments are necessary. The author is not banning all ASMR permanently; they're just asking for adjustments when the author is trying to sleep. That seems fair. The boyfriend could also adjust his routine to a different time when the author is not sleeping, but the scenario suggests he's using it at bedtime.\n\nThe study the author showed might help the boyfriend understand it's not just personal preference but a medical/psychological issue for the author. That should be taken into account. So, the author is justified in their requests because they're health-related. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
