  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author living with their boyfriend and having conflicting bedtime needs.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their boyfriend uses his laptop in bed, either watching YouTube, listening to ASMR, or just using it. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, so they ask him to lower the sound, brightness, etc. The boyfriend seems to dislike these requests but complies. The main issue is when he listens to whispering ASMR, which the author has misophonia towards, causing anxiety and discomfort. The author showed a study on this, and the boyfriend put on earphones.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's health (misophonia) and the boyfriend's habits. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is understandable. The boyfriend is making adjustments, like using earphones after being shown the study. But the author feels guilty for having to ask repeatedly.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're advocating for their health needs. The boyfriend is making efforts, but maybe the author is being too persistent? However, given that it's a health issue, it's reasonable to have these requests. The boyfriend might need to adapt more, like using earphones consistently, but the author isn't unreasonable. The study shows that their reaction is valid. So, the author isn't the asshole here because they're managing a medical condition and trying to maintain their well-being in a shared living space. The boyfriend should accommodate as much as possible, but the author's actions are justified.\n"
