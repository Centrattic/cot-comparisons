  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for always asking my boyfriend to turn his laptop sound and brightness down when I'm trying to sleep and for telling him how anxious, trapped and irritated ASMR makes me when that is his guiltiest pleasure?\nSo we just moved in together, and I knew already his bedtime routine is to watch YouTube, or listen to ASMR, or just be on his laptop in general. I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple moving in together where the author is asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR watching because it affects their sleep and mental state.\n\nFirst, moving in together means both need to adjust to each other's habits. The author has a clear need for silence and darkness to sleep, which the boyfriend's activities are disrupting. They mention trying to communicate this and even providing a study about their misophonia. The boyfriend reacts by putting in earphones, which seems like he's making an effort. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The author is setting boundaries based on their health and well-being. Misophonia is a real condition, so the discomfort isn't just about being picky. The boyfriend's reaction might be frustration or guilt, but the author's actions are about their own needs. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're advocating for their needs and have provided information to help the boyfriend understand. The boyfriend is also making some adjustments. It's a two-way street, but the question is whether the author is the asshole, and in this case, they're not. So the answer should be B.\n"
