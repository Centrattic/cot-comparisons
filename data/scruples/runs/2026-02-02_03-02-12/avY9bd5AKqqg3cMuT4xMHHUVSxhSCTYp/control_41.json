I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening habits when they're trying to sleep. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple just moved in together. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which includes whispering that the author finds uncomfortable due to misophonia. The author asks him to lower the volume, brightness, etc., and even showed a study about misophonia and ASMR.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's health (misophonia) and their living situation. Misophonia is a recognized condition where certain sounds trigger negative emotions. The author's requests are about their well-being. The boyfriend's response was to put in earphones, which suggests he's making an effort. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend might feel his habits are being disrupted, but the author's health and comfort are important. The author is communicating their needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away) might indicate he doesn't want to be a bother, but he's complying. \n\nIs there an imbalance? The author is advocating for their needs, which is valid. The boyfriend is adjusting his behavior. Unless the author is being overly controlling without considering the boyfriend's needs, but in this case, the author's issue is health-related. So, it's more about accommodating each other's needs. The author isn't being unreasonable; they have a legitimate reason. The boyfriend could also find alternatives, like using headphones. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because they're addressing a health issue and making necessary adjustments for their well-being, which is a valid reason to ask for changes in shared living spaces.\n"
