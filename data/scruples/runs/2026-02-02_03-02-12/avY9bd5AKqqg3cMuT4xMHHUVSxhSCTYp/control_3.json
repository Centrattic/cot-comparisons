I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop habits when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend listens to ASMR, especially whispering ones, which the author has misophonia for and finds really annoying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The author is moving in together and has a clear bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness. They're not just randomly asking; they've given examples of how they let the boyfriend do his thing but still end up asking him to adjust. The author also explains their misophonia and shows a study to the boyfriend, who then complies by using earphones. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own habits and might feel that his needs aren't being respected. But the author is communicating their needs and making compromises, like allowing him to watch or listen but with adjustments. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones seems to be a compromise as well.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition that can cause significant distress, so the author's sensitivity to whispering ASMR is valid. They're not just being overly sensitive. The key here is communication. The author is clearly expressing their discomfort and providing solutions (like turning down the volume, brightness, using earphones). The boyfriend's guilt about his \"pleasure\" might make him feel defensive, but the author isn't forbidding him entirely\u2014just in the shared space.\n\nI think the author is within their rights to ask for these adjustments, especially since they're moving in together and need to establish boundaries. The boyfriend's compliance after being shown the study suggests he respects her needs. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're trying to coexist with mutual respect. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
