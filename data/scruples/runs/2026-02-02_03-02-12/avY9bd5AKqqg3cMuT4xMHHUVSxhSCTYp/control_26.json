I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening while they're trying to sleep.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia, specifically to whispering ASMR. They provided a study to their boyfriend, who then used earphones. That's a valid reason because misophonia is a recognized condition. People with misophonia can have strong emotional reactions to certain sounds, so it's reasonable for the author to ask for accommodations.\n\nThey moved in together, so sharing a living space means both need to adjust. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using the laptop, which the author finds disruptive. The author is asking for adjustments like lowering volume and brightness, which are common requests in shared spaces. He does listen and uses earphones after being shown the study, which shows he's making an effort.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they have a legitimate sensitivity and are communicating their needs, it's not unreasonable. The boyfriend is adjusting, so the author isn't being overbearing. The key here is mutual accommodation. Both partners need to find a balance, and the author is within their rights to set boundaries for their well-being.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
