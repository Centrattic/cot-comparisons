I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who likes to use his laptop with sound and brightness on during bedtime, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia triggered by whispering ASMR, leading to anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a new living situation with her boyfriend, and their bedtime routines conflict. She's asking him to adjust his habits to accommodate her need for silence and darkness. She's not just asking once but repeatedly, and she's explained her condition with research. The boyfriend reacts by using earphones, which seems like he's trying to comply. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress. The author's requests are about her health and well-being. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own preferences and habits. But since they live together, there's an expectation of mutual accommodation. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable here. She's made her needs clear and provided evidence of her condition. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he's making an effort. The fact that she's persistent but also shows understanding by letting him watch initially shows she's trying to balance both their needs. \n\nPossible counterarguments might be that she should respect his habits more, but given the health aspect and the fact that she's made accommodations (like letting him have his routine in the first place), it's about finding a middle ground. The boyfriend's willingness to use earphones indicates he's trying to meet her needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole here. She's advocating for her well-being while also considering his preferences by allowing him to have his routine with adjustments. The answer should be B.\n"
