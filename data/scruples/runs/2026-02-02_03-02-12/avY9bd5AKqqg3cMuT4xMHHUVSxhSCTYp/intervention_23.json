I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR consumption during bedtime. The main points here are the boyfriend's routine and the author's need for silence and darkness.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they need a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is a common necessity. The boyfriend, on the other hand, watches YouTube or listens to ASMR, which involves sound and light. The author has to ask him to turn down the volume, brightness, etc. The boyfriend doesn't seem happy about this. \n\nThen there's the ASMR part, specifically the whispering. The author has misophonia when it comes to that, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They showed a study about it, and the boyfriend reacted by moving away and using earphones. \n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong for setting these boundaries? Well, boundaries in a relationship are important. If one person's needs are affecting the other's well-being, it's reasonable to communicate that. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're explaining their health issue (misophonia) and trying to find a compromise. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he's respecting the boundary by using earphones. \n\nHowever, maybe the author is being a bit persistent, but given the health aspect, it's justified. Also, they moved in together, so adjusting habits is part of the process. The key here is that the author is trying to be considerate but also needs their own space. The boyfriend's habits are impacting the author's sleep, which is a basic need. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the right. They're advocating for their needs without being inconsiderate. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure doesn't outweigh the author's health and sleep. Therefore, answer B.\n"
