I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's routine includes watching YouTube, listening to ASMR, or using his laptop. The author has specific issues with the brightness and sound, especially ASMR that involves whispering, which triggers their misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable in a shared living situation. They've moved in together, so both need to accommodate each other's needs. The author is trying to communicate their discomfort and request adjustments. That seems reasonable because everyone has different sleep requirements. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply once he understands the issue. \n\nThe author does mention that they showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, which indicates they're making an effort to explain their condition. It's not just a simple dislike but a medical sensitivity. The boyfriend's initial lack of awareness doesn't make the author wrong; it's a common situation when people have different sensitivities. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider if the author is being too demanding. They say they let him watch his stuff but still ask for adjustments every night. If the boyfriend is making an effort to comply (like using earphones), maybe the author should acknowledge that and perhaps find additional solutions, like using a sleep mask or white noise machine to help themselves sleep better despite the boyfriend's habits. \n\nBut the core issue is that the author is trying to get their sleep environment respected. Since they've moved in together, it's a mutual responsibility to adjust. The author is not being unreasonable by asking for adjustments that affect their health (misophonia). The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, which he might be attached to, but the author's need for a quiet, dark room is just as important for their well-being. \n\nI think the key here is mutual accommodation. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries to protect their health, but maybe there's room for compromise. However, based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong because they're communicating their needs and the boyfriend is partially complying. The boyfriend might need to find alternative ways to enjoy his ASMR without disturbing the author, like using headphones consistently. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
