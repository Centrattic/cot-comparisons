I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to turn down his laptop's sound and brightness so they can sleep. The author has misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate health concern here. Misophonia is a real condition, and it's valid for them to communicate their needs, especially in a shared living space. They moved in together, so it's reasonable to expect that both partners make adjustments for each other's comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's trying to maintain. The author is asking him to change it, which might be frustrating for him. However, the key point here is that the author is not forbidding him entirely from doing these things, just asking for adjustments when she's trying to sleep. They even tried to explain the situation with a study, which shows they're being considerate and providing context.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and putting in earphones seems like he's complying, which is a positive sign. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries in their shared space. It's about mutual respect for each other's needs.\n\nAlso, when you move in together, compromises are necessary. The author isn't denying him his habits entirely but is asking for modifications during her sleep time. That's a reasonable request. So, the answer is B.\n"
