I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable because they have misophonia, especially with whispering ASMR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly stating their needs and boundaries, which is important in any relationship. They\u2019ve tried to communicate their discomfort and even showed a study about it, which seems reasonable. However, the boyfriend might feel his needs for relaxation are being ignored. But the author is living in their own home now, so they have the right to set boundaries in their shared space, especially regarding their health (misophonia is a real condition that can cause anxiety and stress).\n\nThe boyfriend rolling away and using earphones after being shown the study might indicate he respects the author's request. However, if he's consistently ignoring the requests, that's a problem. But the author's main issue is that they keep having to ask every night, which is frustrating. They're not making unreasonable demands; they're advocating for their well-being. Since they're cohabiting, both need to find a compromise. Maybe the boyfriend could use earphones when watching ASMR, or move to another room. The author isn't wrong for maintaining their boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
