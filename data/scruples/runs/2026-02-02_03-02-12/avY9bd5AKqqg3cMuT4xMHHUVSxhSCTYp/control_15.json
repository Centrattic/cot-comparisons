I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is moving in with their boyfriend and there's a conflict over bedtime habits. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable. They ask him to turn down the volume and brightness, and when he listens to ASMR, the author feels anxious and has shown a study about misophonia. The boyfriend responds by moving away and using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. Misophonia is a real condition, so the author's discomfort isn't just being overly sensitive. However, the boyfriend's habits are his personal preference, and the author is asking him to change them. Maybe there's a balance needed here.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They're not outright banning the ASMR, but asking for adjustments that don't interfere with their own sleep. The boyfriend is complying by using earphones and moving, so maybe the author's actions are justified. On the other hand, if the boyfriend is making an effort and the author keeps nagging, that could be the problem. But given that the author has health-related reasons (misophonia), it's probably not their fault. The key is whether the author is being considerate and open to compromise. The boyfriend is already adjusting, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
