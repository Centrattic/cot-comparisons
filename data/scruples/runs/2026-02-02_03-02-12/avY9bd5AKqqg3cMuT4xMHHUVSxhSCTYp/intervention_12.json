I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower the laptop's sound and brightness and for expressing discomfort with ASMR, especially the whispering kind.\n\nFirst, moving in together means they need to adjust to each other's habits. The author has a clear need for silence and darkness at bedtime, which is important for their sleep. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own routine involving the laptop. They both have valid needs here.\n\nThe author is communicating their discomfort, which is important. They even provided a study to explain their issue with ASMR. That shows they're trying to be understanding and not just being difficult. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling over and using earphones\u2014suggests he's making an effort to accommodate. \n\nMisophonia is a real condition, and the author's reaction to whispering ASMR isn't just a personal dislike. So, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being. The boyfriend's habits are causing distress, so the author's requests are justified.\n\nIt's a balancing act, but the key here is communication and accommodation. The author is making their needs known and the boyfriend is trying to comply. It doesn't seem like either is entirely in the wrong, but the main question is about the author. Since they're advocating for their own needs in a reasonable way, they're not the asshole.\n"
