I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or listening to ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable, especially the whispering ASMR. The author mentions misophonia and shows a study to the boyfriend, who then puts in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is moving in with their boyfriend, so sharing a living space. They have different bedtime routines: the boyfriend needs some level of noise and light, while the author needs silence and darkness. The author's requests are to turn down the laptop's sound and brightness, which are reasonable for a shared space. The boyfriend's reaction is to roll away and use earphones, which might indicate he's trying to comply but maybe not fully addressing the issue.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause distress. The author has a valid reason for their discomfort. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, which he enjoys, but the author is clearly affected by it. The author tried to communicate their needs and provided evidence (the study), which shows they're not just being petty but have a legitimate reason.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Are they being unreasonable? They're asking for adjustments that are necessary for their well-being. In a shared living situation, both partners should make accommodations. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not finding a solution that respects both parties' needs, but the author is within their rights to ask for adjustments. However, if the author is being overly demanding without considering the boyfriend's needs, that could be an issue. But based on the information, the author's needs are legitimate, and they've tried to explain their reasoning. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) is a step towards compliance, but maybe more could be done. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing their specific needs. The boyfriend's enjoyment of ASMR is a personal preference that should be balanced with the partner's health. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
