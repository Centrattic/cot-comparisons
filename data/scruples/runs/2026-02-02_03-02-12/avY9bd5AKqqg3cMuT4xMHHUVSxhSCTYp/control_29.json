I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening during bedtime. The situation is that they moved in together, and the author needs silence and darkness to sleep. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness, which the author finds disturbing. The author has explained their discomfort, especially with whispering ASMR, and the boyfriend reacted by using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is trying to get some sleep and has legitimate discomfort with the ASMR, even citing a study about misophonia. The boyfriend's reaction was to put on earphones, which he did after being shown the study. The author is asking if they're the asshole for setting these boundaries.\n\nOn one hand, the author is communicating their needs, which is important in a relationship. They're not unreasonable; they just want a peaceful sleep environment. The boyfriend's habits are affecting the author's well-being, so it's reasonable to ask for adjustments. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his own needs are being ignored. He uses ASMR as a guilty pleasure, so being asked to change might be frustrating for him.\n\nBut the author has tried to explain the health aspect (misophonia) and provided evidence. The boyfriend's immediate reaction suggests he's responsive once he understands the issue. The problem seems to be ongoing, but the author's actions are about their health and comfort, which is a valid concern in a shared living space. The boyfriend might need to find a compromise, like using earphones all the time or adjusting the laptop's brightness and sound proactively. Since the author is making efforts to communicate and the boyfriend is adjusting when he can, it's more about finding a balance rather than the author being in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
