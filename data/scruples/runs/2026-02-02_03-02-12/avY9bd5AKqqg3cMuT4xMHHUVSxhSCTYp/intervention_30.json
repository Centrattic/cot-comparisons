I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend using his laptop late at night with ASMR and sounds, which she's uncomfortable with because of her need for silence and darkness to sleep. She has misophonia specifically with whispering, so she's asked him to adjust his habits.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the key points. The author is explaining her needs and how they conflict with her boyfriend's bedtime routine. She's making reasonable requests, like turning down the volume and brightness, which are common in shared living situations. She also mentions she's shown him a study about misophonia and ASMR, which he respected by using earphones. That seems like a good effort to communicate her needs clearly.\n\nIs there something unreasonable here? Well, people do have different needs when it comes to shared spaces. She's not asking him to stop entirely but to adjust it so it doesn't disturb her. He's made accommodations, but maybe the author might need to consider his needs as well. However, the main issue is that her requests are about her own health and well-being. Misophonia can be a real issue, causing anxiety and discomfort. So, she's not being inconsiderate; she's managing her own condition.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel his preferences are being limited. But when you live together, you have to make compromises. The author isn't forbidding him from doing it entirely, just during times when it affects her. So, in this case, the author is probably not the asshole. The answer should be B, No.\n"
