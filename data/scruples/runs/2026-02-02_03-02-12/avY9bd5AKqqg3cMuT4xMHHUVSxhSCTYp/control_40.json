I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend doing things like watching YouTube or listening to ASMR on his laptop before bed, which is disturbing the author's sleep. The author has to ask him to turn down the sound and brightness because they need silence and darkness. The main issue is the ASMR with whispering, which the author has misophonia, causing anxiety and discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They just moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The author is communicating their needs, which is important. They mention they showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he reacted by putting in earphones. That suggests he's aware of her sensitivity.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for adjustments to their shared living space. The boyfriend's actions are causing her distress, so her requests are justified. However, the boyfriend might feel his needs are being ignored. He has his own bedtime routine that's important to him.\n\nBut the key here is that the author is the one who needs a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is a basic necessity. The boyfriend's actions are intruding on her right to a restful environment. The fact that he's making adjustments when she asks (like putting in earphones) shows he's trying to accommodate her. However, the author is consistently having to ask, which might indicate that the boyfriend isn't fully respecting her boundaries unless he's actively ignoring her requests.\n\nWait, the author says he immediately put earphones in after she showed him the study. That's a positive response. Maybe the problem is that she's still having to ask every night. Maybe the boyfriend isn't maintaining the adjustments consistently. Or maybe there's a communication issue where he's not understanding the seriousness of her misophonia.\n\nAnother angle: moving in together can lead to conflicts about shared space. Both partners have the right to their needs. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. Misophonia is a legitimate medical issue, so her requests are reasonable. The boyfriend should be making an effort to not disturb her sleep. If he's putting earphones in when he knows it's a problem, that's good, but maybe he's not doing it every time, leading her to have to ask repeatedly.\n\nAlternatively, if the boyfriend is making an effort but the author still feels the need to nag, maybe there's an unmet need or a communication breakdown. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that she's explaining her condition and trying to find a solution, and the boyfriend is adjusting when he can, it seems like she's not the asshole here.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's asserting her need for a sleep-conducive environment and has legitimate medical reasons for her discomfort. The boyfriend should respect that, even if it means adjusting his habits.\n"
