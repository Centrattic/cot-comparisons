I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use at night. The main points are about misophonia and the impact of ASMR, specifically whispering, on the author's comfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They moved in together, so establishing boundaries is part of cohabitation. The author has a valid reason\u2014they mention misophonia, which is a real condition that can cause anxiety and discomfort from certain sounds. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using the laptop, which affects the author's sleep environment.\n\nThe boyfriend does make adjustments when asked, like using headphones after seeing the study. That shows he's responsive. The author is communicating their needs, which is reasonable. It's about mutual respect and finding a compromise. Since the boyfriend is making changes, the author isn't being overly demanding. There's no indication of being inconsiderate. The author is also aware of their partner's habits and is trying to work through it with communication. So, the answer is B.\n"
