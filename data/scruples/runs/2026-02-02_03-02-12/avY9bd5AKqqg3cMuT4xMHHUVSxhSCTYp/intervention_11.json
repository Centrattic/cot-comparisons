I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. The main points are about noise and brightness from the laptop, and specifically the ASMR with whispering.\n\nFirst, they moved in together, so sharing a living space means some compromises. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, which is pretty standard. The boyfriend has a different routine, which is using the laptop with ASMR. The author is asking him to turn down the sound and brightness, which seems reasonable. People often have to adjust their habits when they live with others, especially when it affects someone else's sleep.\n\nThe ASMR issue is a bit more specific. The author mentions misophonia towards whispering, which they even showed research about. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative reactions. If that's the case, the boyfriend putting in earphones when ASMR is playing makes sense. The author isn't forbidding him from listening entirely, just not in their presence. It's about mutual respect and considering each other's needs.\n\nThere's a mention of the boyfriend rolling away and using earphones, which indicates he's making an effort. The author isn't asking for a complete change but adjustments that accommodate both needs. Since the author has health reasons (misophonia) and the bedroom is shared, it's a shared responsibility. The key here is that the author is communicating their needs and the boyfriend is responding, which is a healthy part of a relationship. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
