I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening during bedtime. They moved in together, so living arrangements are a big part here.\n\nFirst, the author mentions needing silence and darkness for their bedtime routine, which is crucial for sleep. Their partner's habits include using the laptop with sound and brightness, and doing ASMR, specifically whispering, which they find uncomfortable. They've explained their feelings and shown research about misophonia. The boyfriend responds by moving away and using earphones. \n\nI need to consider mutual respect in a relationship. The author is setting boundaries for their well-being, which is important. The boyfriend is making adjustments, so maybe he's being considerate. But is the author overstepping? They're not dictating the partner's entire routine but asking for specific adjustments that don't infringe on the partner's rights. The ASMR issue with whispering is a valid concern if it causes anxiety. The author is communicating their needs, which is healthy. The partner's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's accommodating, which means the author's requests are reasonable. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the author should compromise more, but they've already made adjustments. The partner isn't resisting, just changing positions. The key here is that the author is advocating for their health without being overly controlling. So the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
