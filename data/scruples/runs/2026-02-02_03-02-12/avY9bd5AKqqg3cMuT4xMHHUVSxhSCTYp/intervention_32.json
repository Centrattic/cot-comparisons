I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend and his bedtime routine conflicting with the author's needs.\n\nFirst, the author needs silence and darkness to sleep, which makes sense. The boyfriend uses his laptop with ASMR and certain sounds, which the author finds uncomfortable. She has a condition called misophonia, especially triggered by whispering. She's communicated her needs, shown him research, and asks him to adjust. He does comply by rolling over and using earphones. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual adjustment. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's made her needs clear and the boyfriend is responding by making changes. The fact that he uses earphones shows he's trying to accommodate her. Misophonia is a real condition, so her sensitivity isn't just a personal dislike. \n\nIs she in the wrong for setting boundaries? Probably not. He's the one with the guiltiest pleasure, but he's adjusting. The author's actions are about her health and well-being. Unless she's being aggressive or disrespectful, which the post doesn't indicate, she's justified. The boyfriend might feel it's a personal preference, but the author has a medical reason here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's advocating for her needs respectfully and the boyfriend is making efforts to comply. The situation isn't one-sided; both are adjusting, but the author's health takes precedence.\n"
