I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for consistently asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR habits to accommodate their need for silence and darkness at bedtime. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple just moved in together. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine involving YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disruptive. The author has specific sensitivities\u2014misophonia related to whispering ASMR, leading to anxiety and discomfort. They've communicated this to their partner, shown research, and the boyfriend has responded by putting in earphones.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is the asshole here. The key factors here are communication, mutual respect, and the reasonableness of the request. The author isn't just making random demands; they have a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that's causing them distress. They've tried to explain their needs and have provided evidence through a study. The boyfriend, upon understanding, has taken steps to comply by using earphones, which suggests he's making an effort to respect their boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's routine is important to him. However, in a shared living space, especially in a committed relationship, both partners need to make compromises. The author isn't entirely unreasonable; they allow the boyfriend to watch his content but need him to adjust the volume and brightness. The boyfriend's adjustment (earphones) is a minimal inconvenience compared to the author's discomfort. \n\nIt's important to consider that misophonia is a recognized condition, even if not fully understood. The author's sensitivity to certain sounds is a valid reason for their request. The boyfriend's response of using earphones shows he's willing to accommodate. There's no indication that the author is overstepping; they're clearly communicating their needs and the boyfriend is cooperating to some extent.\n\nPotential counterpoints: Maybe the author should be more flexible, but the boyfriend's adjustment shows he's making an effort. Also, the author is not forbidding the boyfriend from his activities entirely, just modifying how they're done. The boyfriend's use of earphones seems like a reasonable solution that allows both to have their needs met. \n\nSo, the author is advocating for their well-being in a healthy relationship context. As long as both parties are working towards a compromise, the author isn't in the wrong. The key here is that communication is happening, and adjustments are being made. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
