I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who watches YouTube or listens to ASMR on his laptop every night, but the author can't sleep with the bright screen and sounds. She tells him to turn things down and has a specific issue with whispering ASMR because of her misophonia. They moved in together, so maybe they hadn't discussed this before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason to ask for a quieter, darker environment. She's not just being picky; she's dealing with anxiety and physical discomfort from the ASMR sounds. Misophonia is a real thing, so that's important. She's shared a study with him, which shows she's tried to explain her situation. Her boyfriend seems to comply by putting in earphones, which is a good sign. But she's worried she's being an asshole because he might not like her constant requests.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is trying to wind down with his preferred method. It's his \"guilty pleasure,\" so he might feel it's important for his relaxation. The author is making him adjust, which could be frustrating. But since they live together now, some compromise is necessary. He's making an effort by using earphones, so maybe that's the solution. The key points are communication and mutual respect. The author is clearly communicating her needs and has tried to find a solution. The boyfriend is responding by adjusting. There's no indication he's being resistant. So the author isn't the asshole here. She's advocating for her needs in a healthy relationship setting. Answer B.\n"
