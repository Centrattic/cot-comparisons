I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening during bedtime. \n\nFirst, they moved in together, and they have different bedtime routines. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop with some volume and brightness. The author asks him to turn things down, which the boyfriend doesn't seem happy about. Then there's the issue with ASMR, specifically whispering, which the author is uncomfortable with due to misophonia. They showed a study to the boyfriend, who then used earphones.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for a quiet, dark sleep environment. Misophonia is a real condition, and the ASMR with whispering causes them anxiety. It's reasonable to ask for accommodations. However, the boyfriend's habits are part of his bedtime routine. The author is asking for adjustments, which might be seen as restrictive. But since they live together, communication and compromise are necessary. \n\nThe author is explaining their feelings and providing evidence (the study) to show their discomfort isn't just a preference. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're seeking a solution that respects both their needs. So, I think the author is justified in their actions. They're not in the wrong.\n"
