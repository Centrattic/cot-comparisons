I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to lower his laptop's brightness and volume when they're trying to sleep, especially because the boyfriend listens to ASMR with whispering, which the author has misophonia towards. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and their bedtime routines clash. The author needs silence and darkness, while the boyfriend uses his laptop in the evening with ASMR, which includes whispering that the author finds extremely uncomfortable. The author has explained their feelings and shown a study about misophonia, and the boyfriend's reaction is to put in earphones and roll away. The author is asking if they're being unreasonable.\n\nMisophonia is a real condition where certain sounds cause negative emotional and physiological responses. If the author has that, it's a legitimate issue. The boyfriend's behavior is affecting their well-being. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author has communicated their needs clearly, provided reasoning, and the boyfriend is making adjustments (using earphones). It seems like they're trying to accommodate each other. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel his needs are also valid, but the author's health and comfort are important. Since the boyfriend is taking steps to address the issue, it shows he respects the author's needs. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're setting boundaries for their health. Therefore, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
