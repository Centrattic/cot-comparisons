I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's boyfriend's bedtime habits affecting her sleep. She wants him to lower the laptop's sound and brightness because she needs silence and darkness. She also has a problem with whispering ASMR causing her anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to communicate her needs, which is reasonable since they just moved in together. She's explaining her sensitivity to certain sounds and the research she found. That shows she's trying to be understanding and provide context.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a bedtime routine that he's attached to. The author is repeatedly asking him to adjust, which might be annoying for him. But the key here is that her needs are health-related. Misophonia is a real condition, and if she's experiencing anxiety and discomfort, it's valid for her to address it. She's not just being picky; it's affecting her well-being.\n\nThe question is whether her constant requests are unreasonable. Since they're cohabiting, they both need to make compromises. She's given him options to adjust his behavior, and he does comply by using earphones. That suggests he's making an effort. The author isn't forbidding him from doing his routine entirely, just asking him to modify it to accommodate her needs. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author is trying to find a middle ground without completely giving up her needs. Since the boyfriend is responsive when he listens to the ASMR, it seems like he's respecting her boundaries once he's aware of the issue. The author isn't in the wrong here because she's advocating for her health and well-being while making an effort to understand his habits.\n"
