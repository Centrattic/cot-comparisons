I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage when they're trying to sleep. The main points are about the boyfriend's bedtime routine involving YouTube, ASMR, and the author's discomfort due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of cohabitation. The author has a valid reason\u2014misophonia, which is a real condition causing them anxiety and discomfort. They've communicated this and even provided research, which shows they're trying to be understanding.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, like rolling away and using earphones, might indicate he's making an effort. The key here is whether the author's requests are reasonable. Since they're asking for volume and brightness adjustments, which are common in shared living spaces, it's a reasonable request. People usually accommodate each other's needs in a relationship.\n\nBut maybe the frequency of the requests is an issue. If the author is constantly nagging, that could be seen as a problem. However, the scenario mentions that the boyfriend's habits are part of his bedtime routine, so some persistence is expected. The author's health and well-being are also important here. Misophonia isn't trivial, so their reactions are legitimate.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's enjoyment of ASMR is his pleasure. But in a shared room, one has to consider the other's comfort. The author isn't banning him from doing it entirely, just asking for adjustments that minimize disturbance. That seems fair.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their needs in a reasonable way. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) shows he's making an effort too. The core issue is about mutual respect and accommodation, which the author is doing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
