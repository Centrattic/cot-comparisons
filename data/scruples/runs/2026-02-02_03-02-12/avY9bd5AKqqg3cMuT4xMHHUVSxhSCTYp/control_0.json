I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness, which the author finds disruptive. The author has misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which causes anxiety. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author moved in together and has different bedtime needs: silence and darkness. The boyfriend's routine involves watching YouTube or ASMR, which the author is bothered by. They do ask him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., but he seems to be resistant. The author also explained their misophonia with a study, and the boyfriend responded by putting in earphones.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is trying to communicate their needs, which is reasonable. They have a legitimate health issue (misophonia) that affects their well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) might indicate he's avoiding the issue rather than cooperating. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They're not banning all activities, just asking for adjustments that accommodate both. The boyfriend's pleasure (ASMR) is being restricted, but the author's comfort is also important. The fact that the author tried to explain the medical aspect might show they're not just being fussy but have a valid reason.\n\nPossible angles: The boyfriend could be expected to make some compromises when living together. However, if he's not willing to adjust, maybe the author needs to set boundaries. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're advocating for their health and trying to communicate, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe others could argue the author should find other solutions instead of constant requests. However, given the context of misophonia and the study, it's more about a health issue than just personal preference. So likely the answer is B.\n"
