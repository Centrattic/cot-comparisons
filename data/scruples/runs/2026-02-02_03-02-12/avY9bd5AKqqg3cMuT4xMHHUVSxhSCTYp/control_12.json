I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who uses his laptop at night with ASMR, which the author finds uncomfortable. The author asks him to turn down the sound and brightness, and mentions their misophonia to ASMR whispering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of living together. When two people move in together, adjusting to each other's habits is part of the process. The author clearly communicates their needs, which is important. They mention their sensitivity to certain sounds and show them research, which is a reasonable approach. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's making an effort, which is good.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are communication and mutual respect. The author is setting boundaries, which is okay. But they're doing it every night, which might be seen as nagging if not done in a considerate way. However, the author has a valid health reason (misophonia) which is a legitimate issue. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, so it's his preference, but when moving in together, some compromises are necessary.\n\nThe boyfriend's response seems passive (using earphones) but maybe he's not making enough effort. The author might need to find a solution that accommodates both, like using a white noise machine or earplugs for themselves. But the fact that the author is communicating their needs isn't wrong. However, the frequency of the requests and the boyfriend's feelings should be considered. Maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but perhaps there's a middle ground.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's common to adjust some habits when living with a partner. The author's needs are valid, but so is the boyfriend's need to relax. The answer likely hinges on whether the author is being reasonable. Since the author has a documented sensitivity and is trying to communicate, they're probably not in the wrong. The boyfriend might need to adjust further, but the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
