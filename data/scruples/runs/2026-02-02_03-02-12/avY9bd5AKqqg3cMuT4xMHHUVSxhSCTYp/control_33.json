I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep. The key points here are about their living situation, their differing bedtime routines, and the specific issue with ASMR causing anxiety due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have misophonia related to whispering in ASMR. Misophonia is a recognized condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative emotional responses. The author did research and showed a study to their boyfriend, who then used earphones. That seems reasonable because they're addressing a health issue.\n\nThey moved in together, so adjusting to each other's habits is part of cohabitation. The boyfriend's routine involves using a laptop, which the author finds disruptive. The author is asking for adjustments like lowering volume and brightness, which are common requests in shared living spaces. They\u2019re not banning the activity entirely but want modifications to accommodate the author's needs.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) after being shown the study suggests he respects their request. The author is communicating their needs clearly and taking steps to explain their condition, which is a responsible approach. The boyfriend isn't being forced to stop his habits entirely but is making compromises to coexist peacefully.\n\nConsidering that both parties are making adjustments\u2014author allowing him to watch but asking for modifications, and him using earphones\u2014this seems like a balanced effort. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing a legitimate health concern. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is being addressed without complete prohibition, just adaptation. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
