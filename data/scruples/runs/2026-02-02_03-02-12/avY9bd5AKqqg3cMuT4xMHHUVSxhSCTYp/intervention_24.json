I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop use and ASMR habits when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend's routine includes watching YouTube or ASMR, especially whispering types, which the author finds uncomfortable due to misophonia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living situation: they just moved in together. Adjustments are normal in a new living arrangement. The author's needs for silence and darkness are valid for their sleep. They're making requests, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's habits are his preference, but they're affecting the author's well-being. The author explained their issue with a study, which shows they're not just being picky but have a legitimate sensitivity. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) might indicate he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not enough.\n\nPossible issues: Is the author being too demanding? Are they respecting the boyfriend's needs? But since the boyfriend is using earphones after the author explains the problem, maybe he's making an effort. However, the author's health and sleep are important. They need a good night's rest. If the boyfriend is still causing discomfort despite adjustments, the author's continued requests are justified. The key is whether the author is overstepping. Since they're living together, there's an expectation to find a compromise. The author isn't forbidding him entirely, just asking for adjustments. The boyfriend might need to use headphones and avoid whispering ASMR near the author. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their health, especially with a known condition like misophonia. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
