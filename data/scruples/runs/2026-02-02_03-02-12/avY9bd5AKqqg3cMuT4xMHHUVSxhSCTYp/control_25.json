I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime routine to accommodate their need for silence and darkness.\n\nFirst, they mention they have misophonia, especially to whispering ASMR, which causes them anxiety and discomfort. They provided a study to their boyfriend, who then used earphones. That shows they're trying to communicate their needs and find a solution.\n\nThey moved in together, so adjusting habits is part of the process. They're not asking for a complete stop but reasonable adjustments like lowering volume or brightness. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply, which is positive.\n\nThe key point is whether their requests are unreasonable. The person is advocating for their health and comfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's guilt about his habit might make it hard, but the person isn't being inconsiderate\u2014they're finding middle ground.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing their needs respectfully, and the boyfriend's response shows he's making efforts. The answer should be B.\n"
