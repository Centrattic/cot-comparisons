I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend and the author moving in together. The author needs a quiet and dark environment to sleep, but the boyfriend uses his laptop at night with ASMR, which the author finds very uncomfortable, especially the whispering part.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate health issue, misophonia, which makes certain sounds extremely distressing. They provided research to support their feelings, which shows they're not just being overly sensitive. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a bedtime routine involving ASMR. But moving in together means both have to make compromises.\n\nThe author is asking him to turn down the sound and brightness, which seems reasonable. They're not demanding he stop entirely but to adjust to their needs. The boyfriend's reaction, rolling away and using earphones, suggests he might be dismissive, but the author is trying to communicate their needs. \n\nIs the author being inconsiderate? Probably not. They're trying to accommodate each other, but they have a valid medical reason. The boyfriend should make adjustments if possible. The author isn't wrong to ask for their needs to be met, especially when they've explained the health aspect. So the answer is B.\n"
