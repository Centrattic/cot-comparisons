I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's volume and brightness when they're trying to sleep, especially regarding ASMR content. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their partner just moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves watching YouTube or listening to ASMR, which the author finds disruptive. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep. They ask him to lower the volume, reduce brightness, etc., but he doesn't like it. The main issue is the ASMR with whispering, which the author has misophonia for, causing anxiety and discomfort. They showed him a study about it, and he put in earphones.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author is communicating their needs. They're not being unreasonable by asking for a quiet and dark environment. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a different routine. The key here is communication and mutual respect. If the author is clearly expressing their discomfort and it's affecting their well-being (like misophonia), they're justified in setting boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones suggests he's trying to comply, even if he's not happy about it. \n\nBut wait, is the author being too demanding? The boyfriend might feel his needs aren't being considered. However, the author's health and sleep are important. Misophonia can be a real issue, so it's not just about personal preference. The author isn't forbidding him from doing ASMR entirely, just when they're around. Since they live together, finding a compromise is necessary. The author isn't in the wrong for advocating for their needs. The boyfriend might need to adjust as well. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
