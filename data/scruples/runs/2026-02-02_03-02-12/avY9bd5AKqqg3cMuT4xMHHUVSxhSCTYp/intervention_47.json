I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage so they can sleep. The situation involves moving in together and differing bedtime routines. The boyfriend watches YouTube or ASMR, which the author finds disruptive, especially the whispering ones. The author has misophonia, which makes them uncomfortable with certain sounds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Moving in together means both should adjust their routines. The author is clear about their needs: silence and darkness. They communicate this by asking the boyfriend to lower the volume, dim the screen, etc. It seems the author is respectful, giving specific requests rather than just being demanding. They also explained their misophonia and showed a study, which the boyfriend reacted to by using earphones. That shows the boyfriend acknowledged the issue and tried to comply.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions (putting on earphones) indicate he's making an effort. The author's requests are about their health and well-being, which is valid. Misophonia is a real condition, and it's reasonable to ask others to avoid triggering sounds when possible. The author isn't forbidding him from doing ASMR entirely, just when it's affecting their sleep. They're asking for adjustments that are reasonable and considerate of both parties' needs.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author isn't giving enough flexibility or the boyfriend is being too sensitive. But given the information, the author is making an effort to communicate and the boyfriend is responding. The author isn't unreasonable; they're addressing a legitimate issue. The boyfriend could also adjust his habits, perhaps using earphones more consistently. The author isn't being aggressive but persistent in their needs. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are advocating for their health and have communicated their needs clearly. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is a red herring; the main issue is mutual adjustment in a shared living space. The author's actions are justified to maintain their well-being.\n"
