I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is asking their boyfriend to turn down his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep. The boyfriend listens to ASMR, specifically whispering or vocal ASMR, which the author has misophonia for. The author shows the boyfriend a study explaining their discomfort, and the boyfriend uses earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid health issue here\u2014misophonia is a real condition, though not everyone might be aware of it. They're trying to communicate their needs clearly. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is different, but they moved in together, so mutual adjustments are necessary. The author isn't just being a nagging partner; they're explaining a specific sensitivity and providing evidence. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They're asking for adjustments that respect their health and well-being. It's about cohabiting and respecting each other's needs. The author isn't completely banning the boyfriend from doing his routine, just modifying it when they're in the same room. The boyfriend's reaction (putting in earphones) suggests he's accommodating. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're managing a legitimate sensitivity. The boyfriend's pleasure (ASMR) isn't more important than the author's well-being in this shared living situation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
