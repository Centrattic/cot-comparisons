I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR watching when they're trying to sleep. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, watching YouTube, or listening to ASMR. The author needs silence and darkness for sleep, but the boyfriend's activities are causing disturbances. The author asks him to lower the volume, adjust brightness, use earphones, etc. When he listens to ASMR, especially whispering, it causes the author misophonia symptoms\u2014feeling anxious, unsettled. The author showed him a study about misophonia and ASMR, and he responded by putting in earphones.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for a quiet and dark sleep environment. Misophonia is a real condition that can be triggered by certain sounds, leading to anxiety and stress. The boyfriend's activities are directly impacting the author's ability to sleep, which is essential for well-being. The author is communicating their needs, which is reasonable, especially in a shared living space. The boyfriend's response\u2014using earphones\u2014suggests he's willing to accommodate. However, maybe the author is being too strict? But given the health impact of not being able to sleep, it's not unreasonable. The boyfriend's guilt pleasure might be important to him, but partners usually need to make some adjustments for each other. The author is not asking for the boyfriend to stop entirely but to modify his behavior in a way that minimizes disturbance. The fact that the author explained the study shows they're trying to be understanding and provide a valid reason. The boyfriend's immediate response to put in earphones indicates he's willing to comply. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're advocating for their needs in a respectful way, considering the other person's habits as well. The answer should be B.\n"
