I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening habits so she can sleep.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They moved in together. Her boyfriend uses his laptop at night\u2014watching YouTube, ASMR, etc.\u2014which she finds disruptive. She asks him to lower the sound and brightness, and specifically mentions that whispering ASMR makes her anxious because she has misophonia. She showed him a study about it, and he reacted by putting in earphones.\n\nThe key points here are her health condition (misophonia) and their shared living situation. Misophonia is a real condition where certain sounds trigger strong negative reactions. If her condition is legitimate and well-documented, her requests are likely reasonable. She's trying to accommodate her needs for a good night's sleep, which is essential for well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend has his own bedtime routine that he's attached to. But since they live together, they need to find a compromise. The author is communicating her needs clearly and providing evidence (the study) to explain her issues. The boyfriend's immediate reaction of putting on earphones suggests he's making an effort to comply, which is good.\n\nIs she being too demanding? She's not banning him from using the laptop entirely but asking for adjustments that don't interfere with her sleep. It's a shared space, so mutual adjustments are necessary. ASMR, especially whispering, is a known trigger for some people. Her actions are about health and comfort, not just personal preference.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe she should be more flexible or find a solution like using separate rooms or different schedules. But they moved in together, and her needs are health-related. If he's already using earphones and adjusting brightness, it's a win-win. She's not overstepping by advocating for her health.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's reasonable in her requests given her condition, and he's complying. The situation is about cohabitation and mutual respect.\n"
