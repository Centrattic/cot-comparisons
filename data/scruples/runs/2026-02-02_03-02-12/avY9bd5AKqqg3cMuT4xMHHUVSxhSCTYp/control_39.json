I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his bedtime habits. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness on while the author tries to sleep. The author has specific needs: silence and darkness. They've asked him to turn down the volume, brightness, etc., which he doesn't seem happy with. The ASMR part is a key point here. The author mentions misophonia, a real condition where certain sounds cause distress, especially whispering. They showed a study about it, and he reacted by moving away and using earphones.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is setting boundaries for their own well-being. They've communicated their needs, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate he's not happy with these requests, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. If the author is dealing with a medical condition (misophonia), that adds weight to their requests. It's reasonable to ask a partner to accommodate such needs, especially since they moved in together. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own bedtime routine. However, moving in together often requires compromise. The author isn't forbidding him from doing these things entirely, just adjusting them to minimize disturbance. The fact that he uses earphones after being shown the study suggests he's willing to make adjustments, so the author's approach seems fair. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They're asking for reasonable modifications that don't completely take away his activities. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but the author's health and comfort are also valid. No one should have to stay in a situation where their well-being is harmed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
