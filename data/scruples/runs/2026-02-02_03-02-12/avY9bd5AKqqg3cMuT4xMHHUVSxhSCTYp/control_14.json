I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when they live together. \n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together. The boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using his laptop, watching YouTube, or ASMR. The author needs silence and darkness to sleep. They've asked him to lower the volume, dim brightness, etc., but he doesn't seem happy. The author also has a specific issue with whispering ASMR due to misophonia, which causes anxiety and discomfort. They showed him a study, and he responded by moving away and using earphones.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author is asking for their needs to be met regarding sleep. They have a legitimate medical condition (misophonia) that makes whispering ASMR particularly distressing. They've tried to communicate this, and he's made some adjustments, but maybe not enough? The author is asking for adjustments in volume and brightness, which are reasonable when sharing a space. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're advocating for their own comfort and health. Misophonia is a recognized condition, so this isn't just about being sensitive. They are also making compromises by allowing him to watch or listen, but just with modifications. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away, using earphones) might be a way to comply but perhaps not fully addressing the issue. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The author isn't forbidding him from doing something; they're asking for adjustments that don't infringe on his rights but accommodate their needs. Since they live together, both need to make some accommodations. If the boyfriend is resistant, maybe there's a bigger issue, but the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries for their well-being. So, the answer is probably B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
