I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage at night. The boyfriend watches YouTube or listens to ASMR before bed, which the author finds disturbing. The author mentions that they have misophonia, especially towards whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious and uncomfortable. They've shown the boyfriend a study about this, and he responds by putting in earphones, but the author feels like they're asking too much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what misophonia is. It's a real condition where certain sounds trigger negative emotions. If the author has been diagnosed with misophonia, their sensitivity to certain sounds is valid. The boyfriend's use of ASMR, especially whispering, could be a legitimate trigger. The author is trying to communicate their discomfort, which is important in a relationship. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's reaction: he rolls away and uses earphones. That suggests he's trying to comply. But the author still feels like they're the bad guy for setting boundaries. Is it unreasonable to ask for a quieter and darker environment? The author moved in together and anticipated this issue, so they tried to let him do his thing but still ended up asking for adjustments. \n\nOn the flip side, the boyfriend's bedtime routine is part of his personal habits. The question is whether the author's requests are reasonable. Since the author has a documented sensitivity (as shown by the study), their needs are legitimate. However, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, the boyfriend could use headphones instead of speakers, which would prevent the sound from affecting the author. The author already mentioned he uses earphones when he listens to ASMR after the study was shown, so maybe that's a solution. \n\nBut the problem seems to persist because the author still has to ask every night. The boyfriend might not be consistent in using earphones or adjusting brightness. The author's health and well-being are important here. If the ASMR is causing anxiety, it's not just about personal preference; it's about health. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Relationships require compromise, but the author is communicating their needs due to a medical condition. The boyfriend should make an effort to accommodate that. The fact that the author showed the study indicates they tried to explain the issue rationally. The boyfriend's response of putting in earphones is a step, but if he's not doing it consistently, the problem remains. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't the asshole here. They're advocating for their health and trying to coexist in the shared living space. The boyfriend might need to be more proactive in his accommodations without being prompted every night. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
