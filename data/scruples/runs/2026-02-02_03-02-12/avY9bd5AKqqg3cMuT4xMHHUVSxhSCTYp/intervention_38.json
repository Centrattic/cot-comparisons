I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is moving in with their boyfriend and has different bedtime needs. The boyfriend uses his laptop with sound and brightness, which is bothering the author. The author asks him to adjust the volume, brightness, etc., and specifically mentions that ASMR with whispering makes them anxious. They even showed a study about misophonia and ASMR. The boyfriend responds by rolling away and using earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's requests are reasonable. The author has a valid need for silence and darkness, especially if they have misophonia. Misophonia is a recognized condition where certain sounds cause discomfort. The boyfriend's use of ASMR, particularly whispering, directly conflicts with the author's needs. The author is communicating their boundaries and trying to find a solution, which is reasonable in a shared living situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate. However, the author's repeated requests might be seen as a bit much if the boyfriend is already making efforts. But considering the health impact (anxiety, discomfort), the author's actions are justified. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and health considerations. Since the author is explaining their needs and showing evidence (the study), it's a reasonable approach. The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, but the author's well-being is more important. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
