I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness to accommodate their need for silence and darkness at night. The boyfriend has a bedtime routine that includes watching YouTube, ASMR, or being on his laptop, which the author finds disruptive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has legitimate needs for a quiet and dark environment to sleep, which is common and important for good sleep hygiene. They've tried to communicate their discomfort and even provided research about misophonia related to ASMR, which explains their sensitivity to certain sounds. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has his own routine and preferences, which he might feel are being infringed upon.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author isn't demanding the boyfriend to completely stop his activities but is asking for adjustments that don't interfere with their own well-being. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's complying, which indicates he's trying to meet the author's needs. However, there's a potential for tension if the boyfriend feels his needs aren't being considered as well.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They are setting boundaries for their health, which is valid. Misophonia is a recognized condition, and the author is educating their partner about it. The boyfriend's compliance shows he's making an effort. The author isn't forcing him to stop entirely but is asking for adjustments. This seems reasonable.\n\nPossible counterpoints: The author might not be considering the boyfriend's needs equally. Moving in together requires compromise, and maybe the author isn't finding a middle ground. However, the boyfriend is making changes (earphones, adjusting brightness), which suggests he's also compromising. The author isn't preventing him from using the laptop entirely, just modifying how he uses it around bedtime.\n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend's guiltiest pleasure is ASMR, so he might have a strong preference for it. The author is asking him to forgo that in their shared space, which could be a point of contention. But since the author is allowing background sounds (just not whispering), it's a specific adjustment rather than a total ban. The boyfriend's compliance might mean he's willing to make that trade-off for a harmonious living situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is advocating for their own well-being and has communicated their needs clearly, providing context through research. The boyfriend is making adjustments in response. The situation seems balanced with mutual compromise. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
