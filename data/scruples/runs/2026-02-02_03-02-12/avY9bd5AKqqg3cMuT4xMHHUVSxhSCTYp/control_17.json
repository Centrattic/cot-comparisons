I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the provided situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together where the boyfriend uses his laptop late at night, which disturbs the author's sleep. The author has to ask him to lower the volume, dim the screen, etc. The boyfriend listens, but the author also has a specific issue with ASMR that causes them anxiety. They showed a study about misophonia and ASMR to the boyfriend, which made him put in earphones.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are reasonable. The author needs silence and darkness for their bedtime routine, which is a common need. The boyfriend's habits, while his own, are affecting the author's well-being. The author is communicating their needs and making reasonable requests. The boyfriend is complying, so there's no indication he's unwilling to adjust. \n\nThe ASMR issue is more specific. The author has misophonia related to whispering, which is a legitimate condition. They provided evidence, which shows they're not just being difficult. The boyfriend's reaction (using earphones) suggests he's trying to accommodate. The author isn't forbidding the activity entirely, just adjusting it in a shared space. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? They're asking for adjustments that are necessary for their health. The boyfriend isn't being asked to stop all activities, just to modify them to prevent disturbing the author. Since the boyfriend is cooperating, the author is advocating for their needs appropriately. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the author should have discussed it before moving in, or perhaps the boyfriend's habits are excessive. But the author did mention the boyfriend's routine beforehand and tried to accommodate. The key here is mutual respect and adjustment in a shared living space. The author's actions seem justified to maintain their mental health. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
