I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author shares that they live with their boyfriend and have different bedtime needs. The boyfriend uses a laptop with sound and brightness, which the author finds disruptive. The author asks him to adjust it, and especially dislikes whispering ASMR because of their misophonia. They showed a study to the boyfriend, who then used earphones.\n\nSo, the user wants to know if the author is at fault. My first thought is that the author is trying to accommodate their own needs in a shared living space. Misophonia is a real condition, so the sensitivity to certain sounds is valid. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014rolling away and using earphones\u2014seems like he's making an effort. \n\nBut wait, is the author being too demanding? They mention moving in together, so maybe there's an adjustment period. The boyfriend's bedtime routine is his way to relax, and the author is asking for changes. But if the author's health or comfort is affected, that's a valid concern. The author isn't completely cutting off the boyfriend; they just want adjustments. They also provided a study to explain their issue, which shows they're trying to be understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, communication is key. The author is vocal about their needs, which is important. The boyfriend's response (using earphones) indicates he's willing to compromise. So both are making efforts. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries, especially for a medical condition. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
