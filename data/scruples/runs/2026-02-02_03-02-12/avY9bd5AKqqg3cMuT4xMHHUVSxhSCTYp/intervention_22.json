I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage and ASMR listening when they're trying to sleep together.\n\nFirst, the author shares their need for silence and darkness, which is a valid personal requirement. They mention having misophonia related to whispering ASMR, which is a real condition that causes discomfort with specific sounds. They provided research to explain their sensitivity, which shows they're trying to communicate their needs clearly.\n\nThe boyfriend's bedtime routine involves using a laptop, which is his preference. However, since they live together, there's an expectation of mutual accommodation. The author is asking for reasonable adjustments like lowering volume and brightness, which are common in shared living spaces. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he understands the issue and is complying, but the author feels conflicted about seeming to restrict his habits.\n\nKey points: The author has a legitimate health concern (misophonia) and is communicating their needs. The boyfriend is making adjustments, but the author feels guilty about it. The situation involves balancing personal needs with a partner's habits. Since the author isn't unreasonable and is seeking a compromise, it's likely they aren't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
