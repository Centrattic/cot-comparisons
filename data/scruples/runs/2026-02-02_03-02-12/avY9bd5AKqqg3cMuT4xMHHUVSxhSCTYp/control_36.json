I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop usage during bedtime. The boyfriend watches YouTube, listens to ASMR, especially whispering ones, which the author finds really irritating due to misophonia. The author mentions they have a study to back up their sensitivity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They just moved in together, which can be a time when new living arrangements require adjusting habits. The author has a bedtime routine that requires silence and darkness, which is understandable. The boyfriend has his own routine with the laptop. The author is asking him to lower the volume, reduce brightness, etc., which is a reasonable request for a shared living space. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't just being annoying; they have a specific sensitivity (misophonia) that causes real discomfort. They even provided research to explain their feelings. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's trying to comply, but maybe not entirely happy about it. However, the author's requests are about creating a comfortable environment for both. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Well, they are in a shared space, so each person has to accommodate the other's needs to some extent. The author is not forbidding him from doing these activities entirely but asking to adjust them to minimize disturbance. Since the author has a legitimate reason and has communicated it clearly, it seems fair. \n\nOn the flip side, the boyfriend might feel his needs are being ignored, but the author is also being considerate by allowing some flexibility (like the boyfriend can still use earphones). The study adds credibility to the author's issue, which is a valid reason to make such requests. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their well-being while trying to be respectful. The boyfriend's preferences are acknowledged, but the author's health and comfort are also important. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
