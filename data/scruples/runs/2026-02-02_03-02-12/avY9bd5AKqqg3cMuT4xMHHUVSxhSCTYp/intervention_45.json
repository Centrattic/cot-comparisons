I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who uses his laptop with sound and brightness on late at night, which disturbs the author's sleep. The author has misophonia, particularly sensitive to whispering ASMR, which makes them anxious. They've asked him to adjust his habits, and he responds by using earphones, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a legitimate sensitivity (misophonia) that's affecting their well-being. They're trying to communicate their needs to their partner, which is a reasonable thing to do in a relationship. The boyfriend isn't being malicious; he just has a different bedtime routine. The author is making a case that their needs are valid, and they're adjusting their living situation accordingly. \n\nBut wait, moving in together often requires compromise. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable by asking for these changes. However, given that the author has provided evidence (a study) about misophonia and ASMR, and the boyfriend is already taking steps to accommodate (using earphones), it seems like the author's requests are reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction (rolling away and using earphones) suggests he's making an effort, which is positive.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should be more flexible since the boyfriend has his own habits. But considering the health impact (anxiety, feeling trapped), it's important for the author to maintain a sleep-conducive environment. The author isn't banning all laptop use, just specific aspects that are harmful. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on balancing both partners' needs. The author is advocating for their health and well-being, which is understandable. The boyfriend's response shows he's trying to find a middle ground. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
