I wasn't sure how this was going to go, because my bedtime routine is the total opposite. I need silence and darkness.\n\nI let him watch his stuff, but it still bothers me every night. I usually end up asking him to turn it down, turn the brightness down, roll over, go under the covers, put earphones in, or something. I can tell he doesn't like it.\n\nWhat's worse is when he listens to ASMR, but primarily only whispering or some kind of vocal ASMR. I actually don't mind general background sounds, but I guess I have misophonia when it comes to whispering. I feel extremely uncomfortable, unsettled, fidgety, anxious, and like I need to scratch my brain or something. I found a research study done on misophonia and ASMR about how similar people feel, and I showed it to him. He immediately rolled away from me and put earphones in.\n\nAm I the asshole for pretty much telling him no whispering ASMR around me and always telling him to adjust his bedtime routine?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking their boyfriend to adjust his laptop's sound and brightness when they're trying to sleep, and also expressing discomfort with his ASMR habit, especially whispering ASMR.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a legitimate need for silence and darkness to sleep. Misophonia is a real condition, and the author's reaction to whispering ASMR is genuine. They mention showing a study to their boyfriend, which suggests they're trying to explain their sensitivity. The boyfriend, on the other hand, has a bedtime routine that involves using his laptop, which the author finds disruptive. \n\nThe boyfriend might feel his needs are also important. If he's using the laptop to relax, maybe he feels his routine is being interrupted. However, when two people move in together, compromises are necessary. The author is setting boundaries to protect their well-being, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction of rolling away and using earphones when told about the misophonia study might indicate he's trying to accommodate, but maybe not enough. \n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is consistently asking for adjustments that are necessary for their health, they aren't being unreasonable. However, if the boyfriend is also having his needs unmet, there might be a balance to find. But given the information, the author's actions seem justified because their health and comfort are being considered, especially with a documented condition. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
