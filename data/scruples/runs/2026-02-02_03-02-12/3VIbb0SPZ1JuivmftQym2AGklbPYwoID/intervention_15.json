I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to support his baby sister. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom is pregnant, which adds financial strain. She initially agreed to an abortion after the author and the boyfriend pressured her, but then changed her mind and kept the baby. The author had to use his savings to pay for the abortion, which the mom then spent on baby items. The author feels betrayed and doesn't trust his mom anymore. He's also struggling with school and work, and now that he's 18, he wants to move out to focus on his future.\n\nThe author's main arguments are about financial responsibility and personal autonomy. He's not doing well in school, working a lot, and the added stress of supporting a new sibling could make things worse. The mother's inconsistent decisions (changing her mind about the abortion) and financial irresponsibility (using his money without permission) probably contributed to his decision to move out.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, once someone is an adult (18 in the US), they have the right to make their own life choices, including where they live. Parents aren't legally required to support adult children, and vice versa. The author is taking responsibility for his own life, which is a valid choice. The mother's expectation that the adult son must support her child might be unrealistic, especially since he's already financially stretched.\n\nHowever, there's the emotional aspect. The mother might feel abandoned, and the sister could suffer if the author isn't there. But the author is prioritizing his own well-being and future, which is understandable. The mother's actions have been inconsistent and financially irresponsible, which gives the author reason to protect his resources.\n\nI think the key points are the author's right to autonomy, the mother's financial irresponsibility, and the author's need to focus on his education and future. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
