I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The person is a young adult who's already struggling financially, working to support their mom and themselves, and now their mom gets pregnant. They help pay for an abortion, but the mom changes her mind, uses the money for baby stuff, and then the author is considering moving out because they can't handle the responsibility anymore.\n\nFirst, the author's mom made a decision to have the baby, which the author didn't agree with. They were already in a tight financial situation. The author tried to reason with her, and she initially decided to abort but then changed her mind. Now the author is considering moving out to focus on their education and not take on more responsibility. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support their sister and moving out. Let's break down the key points. The author is an adult and has already started saving for college. They have a job and are trying to improve their GPA. They feel their mom is irresponsible, especially after she took money from their account without permission. The mom is quitting her job, which adds financial strain. The author's main reason for moving out is to avoid being a parent to the baby and to not have to support the family financially, which they can't handle. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as the author is an adult, they're not obligated to support their family financially. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author isn't in a position to help, and their mom's actions have led to this situation. The mom has a responsibility as a parent, not the older child. The author is trying to take control of their life and future, which is understandable. \n\nThe mom's behavior seems to be the root problem here. She made a decision that affected her own family's stability, and the author is the one being forced to take on more responsibility beyond their means. Moving out is a personal choice, and since the author isn't legally required to stay or support their family, they're not in the wrong for choosing to leave to prioritize their own well-being and future. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
