I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse helping with his sister. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant but unemployed. She initially considered an abortion but then changed her mind. The author contributed money for the abortion, but his mom used it for baby items instead. Now she's expecting him to help raise the child. The author is struggling financially, has a low GPA, works part-time, and plans to go to college. He feels he can't handle the added responsibility and wants to move out.\n\nSo, the main points are: the mother's decision to have the baby despite the financial strain, her using his money without consent, and the author's decision to move out to focus on his own life and education. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a moral standpoint, people might argue that he has a responsibility as a brother. However, considering the mother's previous actions\u2014like taking his money without permission and the lack of support from her own boyfriend\u2014it's understandable he wants to set boundaries. Also, the author is prioritizing his future education, which could be seen as responsible in the long run.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that family comes first and he should help his mother. But given the circumstances, his mom's poor financial decisions and the lack of support from the father and the boyfriend, the author's choice to move out might be seen as self-preservation. \n\nLegal age and independence are factors here too. Once he's 18, he's an adult, and it's his right to make his own choices. The mother's reaction, blaming him for being selfish, seems unfair given her own actions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to take control of his life and avoid being exploited again. The answer should be B.\n"
