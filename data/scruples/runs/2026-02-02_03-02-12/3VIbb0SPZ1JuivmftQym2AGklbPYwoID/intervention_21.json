I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for potentially moving out after his mother decided to keep the baby despite earlier decisions. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom got pregnant, initially agreed to an abortion after financial discussions, but then changed her mind. The author helped pay for the abortion but his mom used his money for baby items instead. There's a history of her taking small amounts from his joint account when he was a minor. Now he's 18, has his own money, and wants to move out to focus on school and avoid being stuck as a parent to his sister.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial responsibility, trust, and personal boundaries. The author provided financial assistance for the abortion but then his mother misused the funds. He's also been a victim of previous unauthorized access to his money. Moving out might be his way to regain control and not be burdened by his mother's decisions. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once he's 18, he's an adult and can make his own decisions about living arrangements. Emotionally, he's under a lot of stress with school, work, and family responsibilities. His mother's actions have eroded trust. It's reasonable for him to seek independence to focus on his future. \n\nThe mother's reaction is also concerning. She's shifting responsibility onto him by saying it's his duty as a brother. But the author isn't legally obligated to support her child. The financial strain is real, and he's trying to prioritize his education and stability. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his own well-being and future. The mother made her choices, and he's not responsible for supporting her decisions that impact his life negatively. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
