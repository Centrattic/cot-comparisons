I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person writing the Reddit post) is in the wrong if they decide to move out and leave their family. The main points here are about financial responsibility, family dynamics, and personal well-being.\n\nFirst, the author's mom got pregnant, which added financial strain to an already tight situation. The author tried to reason with her about the abortion, which she agreed to, but then she changed her mind and spent the author's money on baby items. This shows a lack of trust and poor financial management from the mother's side. The author has a history of the mother taking small amounts from their joint account when they were minors, but didn't contest it much. Now that the author is an adult, they're taking steps to secure their own financial future.\n\nThe author is struggling in school with a 2.5 GPA, working to support themselves, and trying to save for college. The added responsibility of a newborn could jeopardize their chances of improving their grades and focusing on education. Moving out seems like a way to regain control over their life and financial stability.\n\nThe mother's reaction to the author's decisions is hostile, accusing the author of being selfish. However, the author is prioritizing their own future and avoiding a situation where they might be forced into parental responsibilities they're not prepared for. \n\nLegally, once the author is an adult, they are not obligated to support their family financially. The mother's financial decisions have already caused personal strain, and moving out is a way to set boundaries. It's also important to consider the author's well-being; staying in a stressful environment could hinder their academic and career progress.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while family obligations can be complex, the author is taking responsibility for their own life. The mother's actions have been inconsistent and self-centered, making it reasonable for the author to seek independence. The author isn't abandoning their sister in a malicious way; they're trying to secure their own future in a difficult situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a hard choice to prioritize their own needs and education in a challenging family context.\n"
