I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The person in question is the older brother of a younger sister. Their mom is pregnant with another child, which is causing financial strain. The brother had initially helped with the abortion cost but found out his mom used his money for baby items instead. Now she's changed her mind and wants to keep the baby, but he's struggling to support himself and his education. He's considering moving out because he can't handle the pressure.\n\nHmm, the key points here are financial responsibility and personal boundaries. The brother has his own financial issues, making more than his mom but barely enough for both of them. He's in school, working part-time, and trying to save for college. The mom's actions\u2014using his money without permission, changing the plan from abortion to keeping the baby\u2014have created a lot of stress. He's been exploited before, taking small amounts from his joint account, but now a large sum was taken for baby items, which he clearly didn't agree to.\n\nIs the brother wrong for wanting to move out? Well, he's an adult now (18) and legally responsible for his own life. His mom's demand that he help raise the baby is a significant burden, especially since he's already struggling. The mom's financial irresponsibility and the brother's lack of control over his resources might justify his decision to leave. He's also prioritizing his education, which is important for his future. \n\nBut on the other hand, there's a family obligation aspect. However, the mom's actions have been negligent, and the brother has already made sacrifices. He's not in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when his well-being and future are at stake. The sister's argument that it's his responsibility as a brother is flawed because he's not legally or financially obligated to support her beyond what he chooses to do. \n\nSo, considering all that, the brother isn't in the wrong for moving out. It's a responsible decision given the circumstances. Answer B.\n"
