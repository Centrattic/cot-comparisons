I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and not support his sister. Let me start by understanding the situation based on the given details.\n\nFirst, the author (let's call him John) has a difficult relationship with his mom. His dad left when he was three, and they're both struggling financially. John is working after school and trying to improve his GPA. His mom got pregnant, called her unemployed boyfriend, and decided to quit her job. John and the boyfriend had a conflict about the pregnancy. The boyfriend wanted an abortion, but the mom insisted on keeping the baby. The boyfriend left, and the mom initially agreed to the abortion but then changed her mind, using John's money for the abortion pill and then later buying baby stuff, even draining his bank account.\n\nJohn tried to set boundaries after becoming 18, moving money to a separate account. When he returned home after moving out, his mom accused him of being selfish and expected him to help raise the baby. John feels he can't handle the responsibility and wants to move out.\n\nNow, the question is whether John is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom what I read, John is in a tough spot. His mom made a series of poor decisions: getting pregnant without the means to support a child, using his money without consent, and then expecting him to take on the role of a parent. John has his own responsibilities, like school and work, and is trying to improve his future. Moving out could be a way to protect his own financial stability and focus on his education. \n\nBut there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their parents and siblings. However, in the U.S., there's more of a focus on individual responsibility, and the legal age of majority is 18, which means John isn't obligated to support his sister unless there's a legal responsibility, which there isn't unless the parents can't provide. However, in this case, the mother is the parent, and the father is absent. \n\nJohn's mom is making decisions that affect the family's stability, and she's not considering the financial implications. She used his money without permission, which is a breach of trust. John's reaction seems to be about protecting his own future. \n\nI think John is not in the wrong because he's setting boundaries and taking care of his own needs. His mom's actions have been irresponsible, and he's trying to avoid being burdened with responsibilities that aren't his to take on. So the answer should be B.\n"
