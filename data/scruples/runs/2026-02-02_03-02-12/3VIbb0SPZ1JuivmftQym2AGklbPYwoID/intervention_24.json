I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they refuse to help their baby sister and move out. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is pregnant and initially decides to have an abortion. The author helps pay for the abortion, but then the mom uses his saved money for baby items and changes her mind about the abortion. The author feels that he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education and work. The mom is upset and accuses him of being selfish.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility and trust. The author is supporting his mother financially, but she keeps making decisions that affect him without considering his input. When he tried to help with the abortion, she spent his money on baby stuff instead. That's a big breach of trust. Also, the author is trying to save for college and improve his grades, but he's struggling with work and school. Moving out might give him more stability.\n\nThe mom's argument is that as a big brother, he's responsible for helping raise the baby. But in reality, the mother is the primary caregiver, and the son shouldn't have to take that on, especially if he's not in a position to do so. The fact that the mother took money from his account without his consent before adds to the justification for him wanting to distance himself. He's 18 now, so he's an adult, and it's reasonable for him to prioritize his own future. \n\nI can see that some might say he has a duty as a sibling, but given the circumstances\u2014his mother's irresponsibility, her history of misusing his money, and his own educational and financial goals\u2014it seems like he's within his rights to move out. He's not abandoning them; he's taking steps to protect his future. The mom's reaction of calling him selfish is a bit hypocritical, considering she's making decisions that burden him. \n\nSo the answer is probably B, not in the wrong. He's making a choice to take care of himself, which is valid.\n"
