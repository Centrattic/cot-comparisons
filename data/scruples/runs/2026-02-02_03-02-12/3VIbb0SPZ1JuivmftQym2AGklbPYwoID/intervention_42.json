I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong if he moves out after his mother's situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author's mom got pregnant, called her unemployed boyfriend, and decided to quit her job. The author was angry because they couldn't afford it. He helped pay for the abortion pill, but his mom used his money for baby stuff instead and then changed her mind. Now she's keeping the baby and blames him for supporting her financially. The author feels he can't trust her anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education and work.\n\nHmm. The author is in a tough spot. His mom's actions caused financial strain and broken trust. The key points here are the mother's decision to use his money without permission, changing her mind about the abortion, and then yelling at him. The author has his own responsibilities and is trying to improve his GPA and save for college. Moving out seems like a way to regain control and not be burdened by his mother's choices.\n\nLegally, once he turned 18, he's an adult and can make his own decisions. Emotionally, he's doing what he can to support himself. The mother's behavior seems to be putting her needs and the baby's on him without his consent. The author isn't being selfish; he's protecting his future. The mom's statement that it's her choice to have a baby and thus his responsibility as a brother is questionable. The author isn't the parent, so that responsibility isn't inherently his. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to take control of his life after the mother's actions have caused him distress and financial issues. Moving out is a reasonable step for him to focus on his future without being dragged down by his family's instability.\n"
