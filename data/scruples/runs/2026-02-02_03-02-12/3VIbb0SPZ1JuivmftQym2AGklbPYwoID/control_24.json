I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to help his sister. The situation is pretty complicated. \n\nFirst, the author's mom is having a baby, but their financial situation is already tight. The author is working, saving for college, and his grades are improving, but not great. The mom initially wanted to abort but then changed her mind and spent his money on baby stuff. The author had to cover the abortion costs but his mom took the money and used it for the baby, which he didn't agree with. He's been a minor before and couldn't control his bank account, so now that he's 18, he's moving the money to a safe place. The mom is angry and blames him for being selfish.\n\nSo, the author feels he can't trust his mom with his money and wants to move out to focus on his education and not be burdened. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, as a sibling, he might feel obligated to help. But considering the mom's actions\u2014changing her mind, taking his money without consent, and dumping responsibility\u2014he's protecting himself. He's trying to save for college and improve his grades. His mom's instability and the financial strain are real factors. The author isn't being selfish if he's ensuring his own future, especially since he's already stretched thin. \n\nHowever, there's a societal expectation that family should support each other. But in this case, the mom's behavior is exploitative. The author is taking steps to secure his future, which is reasonable. He's not the one causing the problem; the mom's decisions are creating the conflict. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
