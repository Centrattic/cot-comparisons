I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author is an older brother who's dealing with a lot of stress from his family situation. His mom is pregnant, but she initially wanted an abortion because she couldn't afford it, then changed her mind and kept the baby. The brother had to pay for the abortion, which cost $800, but his mom took the money and bought baby items instead, leading to a big argument. Now the brother is considering moving out to focus on his studies and not have to support his mom and the new baby.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal aspects. The brother is 18, an adult, so legally he's not obligated to support his family unless there's a court order or something. His mom isn't a minor, so he doesn't have a legal responsibility to support her. The baby is his sister, so he might feel a moral obligation, but legally, he's not required to take care of her. The mother is the primary caregiver, and the father isn't around. So from a legal standpoint, the brother isn't in the wrong for wanting to move out.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The brother has been helping his mom financially, but she's taken money from his account without permission. He's had to work hard to support them both, and now with the new baby, he's overwhelmed. His grades aren't great, but he's trying to improve. Moving out seems like a way to take control of his life and focus on his future. The mom's argument that it's his responsibility as a brother might be emotionally charged, but he's not legally required to stay. \n\nThere's also the issue of trust. The brother has lost trust in his mom because she took money without his consent before and now did it again. He's moving out to avoid that again. It's understandable that he wants to be independent. The mother's reaction, yelling and calling him selfish, might be a way to make him feel guilty, but that doesn't justify her actions.\n\nAnother angle is the financial situation. The brother and his mom are barely getting by. With the rent increasing and the mother quitting her job, their financial stability is at risk. The brother is trying to save for college, which is important for his future. Staying might mean he can't focus on his education, which could impact his long-term prospects. Moving out could be a responsible decision to invest in his own future.\n\nHowever, there's the moral argument. The brother is the sibling closest to the mom, and there's a sense of responsibility towards his sister. But he's also an adult now, and taking care of a baby is a huge responsibility. He might feel that he can't take that on, especially since the mother is the parent and should be the one handling it. The mother's insistence that it's his responsibility as a brother could be seen as shifting her own responsibilities onto him, which isn't fair.\n\nIn summary, the brother isn't legally obligated to support his mom and sister. His decision to move out is a way to prioritize his own future and well-being, especially given the mother's past financial irresponsibility. While there's a moral component, the brother isn't in the wrong for choosing to take care of himself. The mother's actions and the financial strain are contributing factors to his decision. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
