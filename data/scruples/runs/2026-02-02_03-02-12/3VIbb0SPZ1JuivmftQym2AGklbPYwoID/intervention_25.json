I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to support his baby sister and moving out. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a pregnancy. The boyfriend was involved but left, and after some back and forth, the mom decided to keep the baby. The author had helped pay for the abortion, but the mom used his money for baby items instead. Then, when the author tried to manage his finances by moving money to a separate account, the mom accused him of being selfish. Now, the author is considering moving out to focus on his education and not take on the responsibility of the baby.\n\nThe key points here are the financial strain, the mom's untrustworthiness with the author's money, and the author's need to focus on his future. The author is trying to take control of his life and avoid being burdened by his mother's decisions. He's made it clear he can't support the baby, and he's moving out to take care of himself. \n\nI need to consider if he's being selfish or if he's protecting himself. The mom's actions\u2014using his money without consent, making sudden decisions about the pregnancy\u2014show a pattern of relying on him financially. The author's move to secure his own financial independence by moving out seems justified, especially since he's already struggling with his studies and job. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, parents are generally responsible for their children, not the other way around. The author was a minor before and had to rely on his mom for a joint account. Now that he's an adult, he's trying to separate his finances, which is a normal step towards independence. The mom's reaction seems to be projecting her responsibility onto him, which isn't fair. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the abortion money. The author gave his money, and the mom used it for baby things after deciding to keep the baby. That's a breach of trust. The author's distrust and decision to move out to avoid further financial strain makes sense. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's taking steps to take care of his own future and can't be expected to support a sibling when the parent isn't capable. The answer should be B.\n"
