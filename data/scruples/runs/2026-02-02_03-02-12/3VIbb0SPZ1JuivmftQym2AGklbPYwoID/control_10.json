I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for considering moving out after their mom decided to keep the baby, despite earlier agreements.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's mom got pregnant, initially considered aborting because they couldn't afford another child, and the author helped pay for the abortion. However, the mom then changed her mind, used the author's money to buy baby items, and now the author feels they can't trust their mom anymore. The author is struggling financially, working to support themselves and their mom, and now feels overwhelmed by the prospect of helping raise another child. They want to move out to focus on their education and life.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility, family obligations, and personal boundaries. The author has been supporting their mom financially, which is a lot already. The mom made decisions that affected the author's finances, like using their money for the abortion and then changing her mind, leading to more expenses. The author might feel that by moving out, they're protecting their own future and well-being.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Legally, parents have the responsibility to care for their children. The author is an adult now, so they're not legally obligated to support their sister. However, family dynamics are complex. The author had to make a tough choice about whether to help with the abortion, and the mom's betrayal by changing her mind and using the money might have broken trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's sister (the mother) might feel that as a parent, she has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy, even if it's financially challenging. But she also made promises not to take the author's money, then went back on them. The author's decision to move out could be seen as self-preservation, given the circumstances.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author is already stressed with school, work, and financial strain. Adding a new baby into the mix could make things worse. Moving out allows the author to focus on their own goals without the added pressure. However, the sister's argument that it's the author's responsibility as a big brother might stem from a place of feeling that they have to help out, but that's not necessarily fair given the mom's actions.\n\nI think the key here is consent and boundaries. The author isn't legally or morally obligated to support the baby, especially since their mom made decisions without considering the author's input. The author has the right to prioritize their own life and well-being. The mom's actions in using the money and then changing her mind were deceitful and added to the author's stress. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to move out to take care of themselves.\n"
