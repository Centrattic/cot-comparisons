I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse helping with his sister. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author has a strained relationship with his mom. His dad left when he was 3, so he's had to be the main provider for the family. He's working a job, making more than his mom, but they're still barely making ends meet. He's also in school with a 2.5 GPA, trying to improve for college. So his life is pretty stressful.\n\nThen, his mom announces she's pregnant and quits her job. This puts even more financial strain on them. The boyfriend threatens to leave unless she aborts, but she insists on keeping the baby. The author and his mom argue, he apologizes, and she eventually decides to abort. He offers to help with the cost, but she spends all the money on baby items and changes her mind about the abortion. Now she's accusing him of being selfish and expecting him to take responsibility as a big brother.\n\nThe author feels he can't trust her with his money anymore, especially since she's taken small amounts before when he was a minor. He's saving up to move out, thinking it will help him focus on school and his future without the financial burden.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, family responsibilities can be a gray area. The author is in a difficult position where his mom's decisions directly affect his ability to support himself and his education. He's not a parent himself, just a brother. While he might feel a sense of duty, it's also understandable that he can't take on the role of a parent for his sibling, especially when his mother is making poor financial decisions and not following through.\n\nHis mom's actions seem to be putting her own desires above the family's stability. She's making choices that impact their financial health, and then shifting the responsibility onto her son. The author is trying to take control of his own future, which is a valid reason to move out. He's not abandoning his sister necessarily, but he's setting boundaries to protect his own well-being and future. \n\nLegally, parents are responsible for their children, but since the author is an adult, he's not obligated to support his sister financially. The mother's behavior of taking funds without consent and then changing her mind about the pregnancy complicates things further. The author's decision to move out seems like a self-preservation step rather than a selfish act. He's prioritizing his education and stability, which are important for his long-term success.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a tough choice to take care of himself when the family structure isn't supporting him. The answer should be B.\n"
