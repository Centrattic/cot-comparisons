I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to move out and refuse helping with his baby sister. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is dealing with a family where the mom is making poor financial decisions. She got pregnant, then quit her job, and initially decided to have an abortion but later changed her mind. The author helped pay for the abortion but then found out his mom used his money to buy baby stuff instead. This is a big issue because he had to dip into his savings for that abortion, then she took his money again. \n\nNow, the author is considering moving out. He's not doing great in school but is working and trying to improve. He's worried about being stuck supporting his sister if he stays. The mom is acting like it's his responsibility as an older brother. But he's already stretched thin financially and can't afford to take on more.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, does the author have a right to move out? Well, in most legal systems, once someone is an adult, they can choose to leave. There's no legal obligation for siblings to support each other unless there's a court order. The author is trying to take control of his life, focus on education, and not be burdened by his family's instability. \n\nHis mom's actions are questionable. She made impulsive decisions, lied about using his money, and then blamed him for being selfish. The author is just trying to protect his own future. Moving out seems like a responsible step for him to take, especially since he's contributing to his own financial independence. \n\nBut is he in the wrong morally? Some might argue that family should support each other. However, the mom and boyfriend (now gone) have been irresponsible. The author has already tried to reason with his mom, who ignored his advice and took his money. Continuing to support her without consent isn't fair. He's not refusing help entirely but is trying to set boundaries after being taken advantage of. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (he's not in the wrong). He's prioritizing his own well-being and future after being let down repeatedly.\n"
