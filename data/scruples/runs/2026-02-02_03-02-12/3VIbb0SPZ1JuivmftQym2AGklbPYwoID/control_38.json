I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is an older brother who's trying to support his mom and himself financially. His mom got pregnant, and they couldn't afford it. He helped pay for an abortion but then his mom changed her mind and kept the baby, using his money for baby stuff. Now he's considering moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is making decisions that impact the family's financial stability. The author is already struggling with his own school and work, and the mom's actions have added more stress. He's contributed money for the abortion but then his mom took that money and spent it on baby items, going against his advice. This shows a lack of trust because the author can't rely on his mom to make responsible decisions. \n\nThe author is also trying to take control of his life by moving out. He's in a tough spot with his grades and work. Moving out might help him focus on his education and future without the added burden of supporting his mom and her new child. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as a minor, the author didn't have control over the joint account. Now that he's 18, he's taking steps to manage his finances independently, which is his right. His mom's reaction of blaming him for selfishness is probably not justified if he's trying to take responsibility for his own life. \n\nBut is he being selfish? Well, he's not the one who made the decision to have the baby. The mom changed her mind after he helped her get the abortion. That's a big shift in responsibility. The author isn't obligated to support another child, especially when his mom is not making responsible financial choices. \n\nOn the other hand, moving out might leave the mom in a worse situation. But the author has the right to prioritize his own well-being and future. It's a tough situation where he's trying to take control of his life. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to protect his own interests and future, especially after the mom's actions have shown that she can't be trusted with financial responsibility. The mom's choices have led to this conflict, and the author is taking steps to avoid being overwhelmed by her decisions. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
