I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for moving out and refusing to help his sister. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's mom had a pregnancy, and there was a financial strain. The family was already struggling, and the mom wanted to keep the baby but then changed her mind, leading to an abortion paid by the author. But then the mom took the author's money for baby items and decided to keep the baby anyway. The author feels betrayed and can't trust his mom anymore. Now he wants to move out to focus on his education and not be burdened further.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's trying to take control of his life. He's working, saving for college, and his GPA is improving. The mom's financial irresponsibility and manipulation are a big issue here. The author had to manage the joint account, which the mom accessed without permission. Once he turned 18, he secured his money, which makes sense.\n\nThe mom's behavior seems erratic. She initially wanted the abortion but then changed her mind after taking the author's money. Her justification that it's the author's responsibility as a big brother is a stretch. The author isn't legally obligated to support her child, especially given the financial instability. \n\nThere's also the context of the father leaving when the author was 3, so maybe the author never had a strong support system. Now, with the added stress of a new sibling, it's understandable he wants to move out. The key points are financial responsibility, personal autonomy, and the mom's manipulation. The author is protecting his future, which is important for his education and well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations are important, but in this case, the mom's actions have been selfish and harmful. The author isn't being selfish by prioritizing his own needs after being let down repeatedly. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
