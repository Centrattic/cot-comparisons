I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to take care of his sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mom is pregnant with a new baby, but she initially planned to abort after the boyfriend's pressure. However, the mother then kept the baby and used the author's money meant for the abortion to buy baby items. The author feels he can't trust her with his finances anymore and wants to move out to focus on his education and work.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's actions. She took money from the joint account without permission, then changed her mind about the abortion, using the funds for the baby. The author feels financially burdened and doesn't want to be responsible for the child. \n\nLegally, parents are responsible for their children. However, the author is an adult now, so he's not obligated to support his sister unless there's a legal guardianship or some other arrangement. Since the author is moving out, he's choosing to step away from the responsibility, which he's not legally required to take on. \n\nEmotionally, the author is dealing with a family that's not stable\u2014father left, mother's financial irresponsibility, and the new sibling. His decision to prioritize his own future is understandable. The mother's reaction, screaming and blaming him, shows a lack of accountability. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish in the sense of not wanting to help, but rather recognizing his own limits and the mother's inability to manage responsibilities. The mother's actions (using funds without consent) are problematic, and the author is protecting himself from further exploitation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a choice to take control of his life despite the family's situation. The answer should be B.\n"
