I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to help with his baby sister. \n\nFirst, looking at the context: The author's mom got pregnant, which they couldn't afford. The boyfriend threatened to leave unless she had an abortion, but she decided to keep the baby after initially getting the abortion pill and then using the money for baby items. The author contributed $675, then had to take out another $400 from a joint account, but the mom spent all the money on baby stuff and changed her mind about the abortion. Now, she's yelling at him about responsibility, and he's thinking of moving out.\n\nSo the author is in a tough spot. His mom made a decision that affects his finances and stability. He's trying to focus on school and his future. The mom seems to be acting irresponsibly, making decisions without considering their financial situation, and then blaming her son for not supporting the baby. The author is considering moving out to take care of himself and his education.\n\nLegally, once he's 18, he's an adult and can make his own decisions. Emotionally and morally, it's a gray area. While family support is important, the mother's actions have been inconsistent and have placed a burden on him. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize his own well-being, especially when he's already contributing and the mother isn't showing responsibility. \n\nThe mom's behavior, like taking money from his account without permission and changing her mind, shows a lack of accountability. The author's response is about self-preservation and setting boundaries. So, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong. The choices made by the mother have led to this situation, and the author is trying to protect his future.\n"
