I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a young adult considering moving out due to family issues involving his mother's decision to have another child after initially deciding to abort, and financial struggles.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's mom is pregnant, quits her job, and initially decides to abort because they can't afford it. The author helps pay for the abortion, but the mom then changes her mind, spends the money on baby items, and insists the author should help raise the child. The author feels overwhelmed and wants to move out to focus on his education and career, not wanting to take on the responsibility of a sibling.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for moving out. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nI should consider the context. The author is already stretched thin with work, school, and financial instability. His mom's actions have been inconsistent and possibly manipulative. She took money not for the purpose agreed upon, which led to a breakdown in trust. The author is trying to take control of his life and future, which is often a valid reason for moving out.\n\nLegally, once he's an adult, he's not obligated to support his family. Emotionally, he's justified in not wanting to take on more responsibility if it's not feasible. The mom's argument that it's his responsibility as a big brother is a common parental pressure tactic, but the author isn't legally responsible for his sister.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say he should help his family since he has the means. But the author's own well-being and future are important. He's trying to save money for college and improve his grades. Staying might compromise his education and career, which are long-term goals.\n\nAlso, the mother's actions (taking money, changing her mind about the abortion, not respecting his input) have contributed to the strained relationship. The author's decision to move out is a way to set boundaries, which is healthy.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's making a choice to prioritize his own future and well-being, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
