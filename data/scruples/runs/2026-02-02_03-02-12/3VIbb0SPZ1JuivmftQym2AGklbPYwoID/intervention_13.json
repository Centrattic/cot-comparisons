I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong if he refuses to help his baby sister and moves out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mother had an abortion but then changed her mind, used his money to get the abortion pill and then bought baby items. She also has a history of taking small amounts from his joint account. The author is struggling with school, working, and their financial situation is already tight. He feels he can't trust his mom anymore and wants to move out for his own stability and education.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility, autonomy, and the financial burden. The author is trying to take control of his life, especially since he's an adult now. His mother's decisions are adding stress and financial strain. The sister is a baby, so she can't help herself, but the author is considering his own well-being. \n\nIs it fair for him to prioritize his future? Moving out might be seen as abandoning family, but the mother's actions have led to this situation. The author is not refusing to help out of selfishness but because he can't trust her and needs to focus on his studies. The mother's response was hostile, which might justify his decision. \n\nLegally, once he's 18, he's an adult and not obligated to support his family unless there's a court order. The mother took his money without permission, which is a red flag. He's trying to protect his resources for his own future. \n\nEmotionally, it's a tough call. Family obligations can be heavy, but the author is setting boundaries. The mother's behavior (changing her mind on the abortion, stealing money) is problematic. The author isn't cutting off his sister entirely but is stepping away from the toxic environment.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, while family support is ideal, the author has the right to prioritize his own needs, especially after being wronged. The sister is a baby, so she's not at fault, but the mother's actions are the root issue. The author moving out could prevent further exploitation and allow him to focus on his education and stability.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting himself from an unstable situation and taking steps towards his own future. The answer should be B.\n"
