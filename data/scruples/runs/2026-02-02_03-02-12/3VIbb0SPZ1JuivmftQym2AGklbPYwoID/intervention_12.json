I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong if they move out after the events described. The person in question is the author's friend, who's dealing with a complicated family situation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The mom is pregnant, and her boyfriend left. The author's friend is the older brother, and they're both struggling financially. The mom initially agreed to an abortion after the brother helped pay for it, but then changed her mind and spent the money on baby items. The brother feels betrayed and is considering moving out.\n\nThe key points here are the financial responsibility, the brother's well-being, and the mother's decisions. The brother has been working hard, trying to improve his grades and save for college. The mother's actions\u2014like taking money without permission and then changing her mind about the abortion\u2014must have put a strain on their relationship and the household's stability.\n\nThe brother's decision to move out could be seen as a way to take control of his life, especially since he can now afford to live on his own. The mother's argument that it's his responsibility as a sibling might not hold much weight if he feels he's being unfairly burdened. Also, considering the history of financial issues and lack of trust, moving out might be a reasonable step for him to focus on his future.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family responsibility. But in this case, the brother has been the primary financial support, and the mother's actions (like spending the abortion money on baby items) might have crossed a line. The mother's insistence that he help raise the baby could be seen as unfair, especially if she's not contributing adequately.\n\nSo, considering all this, the brother isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's trying to protect his future and his financial stability, which are important for his education and independence. The mother's actions and the existing tension in the household make his decision to move out understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
