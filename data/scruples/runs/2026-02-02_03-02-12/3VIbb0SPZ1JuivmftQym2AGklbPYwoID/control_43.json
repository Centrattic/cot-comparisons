I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to support his baby sister and moving out. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is expecting a baby and she's quitting her job. They already have financial struggles. The author is working, making more than his mom, but together they're just barely getting by. The mom initially decides to have an abortion after the author explains the financial issues, but then she changes her mind and keeps the baby. Then she uses the author's money that was meant for the abortion to buy baby stuff. There's a history of the mom taking small amounts from his account before. Now the author wants to move out to focus on his education and not be responsible for the baby.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's been supportive, tried to help with the abortion, but now feels betrayed because his money was misused. He's also under stress with school and work. His main concern is not being able to handle the additional responsibility of a sibling and wanting to prioritize his future. \n\nThe mom and the author have a strained relationship. The mom's boyfriend situation adds to the chaos. The author's actions are about self-preservation and improving his own life. Legally, once he's 18, he's an adult, and while he might feel a moral obligation, there's no legal requirement for him to support his sibling unless specified by law, which varies. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue he's being selfish by leaving his family in a tough spot, but others might say he's doing what's best for himself when he's already stretched thin. The mom's actions, like using his money without consent, are problematic. The author's decision to move out is a way to regain control over his life and finances.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's making a tough choice based on his circumstances. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
