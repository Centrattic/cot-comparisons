I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is an older brother whose mom just decided to keep the baby after initially considering an abortion, which the author had helped pay for. The mother had a history of taking money from their shared account without permission, and the author is now considering moving out because he can't handle the responsibility of supporting another child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The author is an adult now, having turned 18, and has the financial means to move out. Legally, parents aren't required to support adult children, and vice versa. So if the author wants to move out, he's not necessarily breaking any laws here. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author has reasons to feel overwhelmed. His mom's decision to have the baby despite their financial struggles and her previous behavior of taking money without consent adds to his stress. He's also dealing with his own education and work, which is important for his future. The mother's reaction, accusing him of being selfish, might not be fair given the circumstances. However, as a sibling, there might be an expectation of support, but the author isn't a parent, so his responsibility isn't the same as a parent's. \n\nThe mother's actions\u2014changing her mind about the abortion, using the money for baby items, and not being responsible with finances\u2014could justify the author wanting to distance himself. He's trying to take control of his own life and future. Moving out could be a reasonable step to focus on himself, especially since he's in a position to do so financially. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a sibling, he has a moral duty to help, but given the mother's role as the parent, the primary responsibility for the child should fall on her. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own well-being when the parent isn't fulfilling their duties. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). He's making a choice that's in his best interest given the family's financial instability and the mother's poor decision-making.\n"
