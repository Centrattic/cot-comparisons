I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for considering moving out and refusing to help with his sister. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author's mom is pregnant, but she initially wanted an abortion after the boyfriend left. He helped pay for the abortion pill, but then she spent his money on baby stuff and changed her mind, deciding to keep the baby. The author feels his mom is unreliable with money and now wants to move out to focus on his education and work. The key points here are financial responsibility, family obligations, and personal well-being.\n\nThe author has a 2.5 GPA, which he's working to improve, and he's trying to save for college. Moving out would allow him to focus more on his studies and reduce the time he spends working. His mom's actions\u2014like taking money without consent, changing her mind about the pregnancy, and now blaming him for responsibility\u2014seem to be a big part of his decision.\n\nLegally, he's an adult now, so he's not obligated to support his family financially. The question is whether he's morally or ethically in the wrong. Arguably, he's taking responsibility for his own life and future, which is important for his personal growth. On the other hand, some might say he's abandoning family in a difficult time. But given that his mom has been inconsistent and unreliable, maybe he's justified in prioritizing himself.\n\nHe also mentions that his mom has taken his money before, even when he was a minor. That shows a pattern of behavior where he can't trust her with his finances. Moving out is a way to protect himself from further exploitation. His main concern is being able to focus on his education and work without the burden of supporting his mother and her decisions.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), he's not in the wrong. He's making a self-preservation and personal development choice, especially since he's an adult and not legally responsible for his family anymore.\n"
