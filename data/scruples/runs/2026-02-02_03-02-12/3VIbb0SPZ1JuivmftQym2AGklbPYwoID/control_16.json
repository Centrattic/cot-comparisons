I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering moving out and not helping with his baby sister. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's mom is pregnant and initially decided to get an abortion after the author's arguments. But then she used his money for the abortion and later changed her mind, buying baby items. She also took money from the joint account when he was a minor, which he doesn't trust her with anymore. The mom's boyfriend situation was a mess, and the mom is now being hostile, shifting responsibility onto the author.\n\nThe author is struggling with school and work, making just enough with his mom to survive. His GPA is low, but he's improving. Moving out would let him focus on college without the stress. The mom is unemployed and her new boyfriend isn't supportive. The author feels he can't trust her with his money anymore after she drained his account twice.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility, parental obligations, and the author's ability to care for himself. The mom is the parent, so legally and ethically, she's supposed to take care of the kids. However, she's not in a stable situation, quitting her job, and relying on her son. The author is an adult now, and moving out seems like a reasonable step to focus on his future. \n\nThe mom's behavior shows a lack of responsibility. She changed her mind about the abortion, used the son's money without permission, and is now blaming him for being selfish. The author has a right to prioritize his own life, especially since he's supporting them both but can't trust his mother. Moving out might be a necessary step for his well-being and future.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's taking steps to protect his financial stability and educational goals, which are valid. The mother's actions have been negligent, so the author's decision to move out is justified.\n"
