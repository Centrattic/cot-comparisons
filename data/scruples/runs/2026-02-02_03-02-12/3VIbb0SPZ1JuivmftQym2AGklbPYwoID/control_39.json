I copied &amp; pasted his text and haven't edited it in any way.) This is his post in his own words:\n\nMy mom and I aren't that close. My dad walked out when I was 3. I make more than my mom, but together we make just enough to keep our heads above the water.\n\nI\u2019m not doing great in school right now. I have a 2.5 GPA which isn't bad, but isn't great either. I go to work right after school but when I get home, I'm too tired to study for long. However, I'm improving my grades and saving for college.\n\nOur rent increased so I had to find a better job. That's when my mom called her unemployed boyfriend &amp; me &amp; announced her pregnancy. She also told us that she\u2019s quitting her job because it's \"not good for the baby.\u201d We were both visibly angry. I yelled at her since we can barely care for ourselves. Her boyfriend threatened to leave unless she aborted, but my mom INSISTED that he'll \"learn to love his daughter\" when she's born, but he'll need to work to support the baby. But her boyfriend wasn't having any of it; he just tried to convince her into doing basically ANYTHING but keeping it, but as soon as he realized he was beating a dead horse, he disappeared. My mom still can't get into contact with him.\n\nI apologized to her for being so harsh, but reasoned with her why keeping it isn't wise. I reminded her how we can barely get by now, so we can't afford for her to quit &amp; support a baby. I told her she doesn't HAVE to abort, but if she won't be able to work while pregnant, she should consider since we can't and won't survive on just my income. She then decided to abort. Luckily it was still early enough to get the abortion pill. It costed $800. I had $675, but I told to get $400 out of my account to help pay for it. She DRAINED my account &amp; spent it all on baby items. I came home to a fucking mountain of diapers &amp; baby clothes. I asked her about it, &amp; she casually said, \"oh yeah I changed my mind. I'm keeping it.\"\n\nShe\u2019s taken from my account without my okay before. I\u2019ve confronted her, but since it was usually only 5-10$, I never made a HUGE deal about it.  I was a minor at the time too so for me to even HAVE a bank account, a legal adult had to be a joint account holder. \n\nAs soon as I turned 18, I withdrew all the money from the joint account &amp; put it in an account that my mom doesn\u2019t have access to.\n\nWhen I got back home, she screamed at me saying \u201cIT'S MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BABY SO IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS A BIG BROTHER TO HELP RAISE HER!\" When I told her why I no longer trust her with my money, she yelled, \"I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW SELFISH YOU'RE BEING RIGHT NOW!\" \n\nNow I feel like my mom will just dump being a parent on me &amp; I just can't handle that. As of now I have enough to move out. I feel like I'll be able to focus on my education &amp; not have to spend so much time at work if I'm just supporting myself.\n\nSo WIBTA if I just walked out?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the person considering moving out because their mom had a baby, which added financial strain, and they don't trust her anymore after she took money from their account.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's mom got pregnant, initially decided to have an abortion with his help financially, but then changed her mind and used his money for baby items. The author has been supporting the family financially, especially since their dad left. They're not doing great in school and want to focus on college. The mom is also not working now, adding to the financial burden. The author feels they can't handle being a parent to the baby and decides to move out.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author is an adult, has their own money, and is trying to take control of their life. The mom's actions\u2014using the money without permission, changing her decision about the abortion\u2014might be seen as irresponsible. The author is not legally obligated to support the baby unless they're a guardian or have a court order. They were a minor before and now that they're 18, they have the right to manage their own finances. Moving out allows them to focus on their education and independence, which is a valid choice.\n\nBut some might argue that as a sibling, the author has a moral responsibility. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" The author isn't breaking any laws or violating a legal duty here. They're making a personal choice to prioritize their own well-being and future. The mom's decisions have led to this situation, so the author's reaction is a self-protective measure. The fact that the author tried to reason with the mom and even helped with the abortion before she changed her mind shows they tried to be supportive. Now, given the mom's behavior, moving out is a reasonable step. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
