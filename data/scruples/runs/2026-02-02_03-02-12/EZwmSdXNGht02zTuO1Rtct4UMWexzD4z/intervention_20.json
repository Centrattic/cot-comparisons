The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring to their own students after school. They provide snacks and spend their own time. That's pretty generous. Now, a parent from another school contacts them because her friend's child (the teacher's student) is getting help, and she wants the same for her son. \n\nBut the key point here is that the child attends a different school in another county and gets out later. The teacher's current tutoring starts at 2:50, right after their own school ends. The other school ends 30 minutes later, so the new student would arrive around 4:15. The teacher can't accommodate that because they're exhausted by 4:15 and need to go home. They also mention their own son's homework, which is a hassle. \n\nThe teacher offers $25 per session, which is slightly below the local going rate of $30. The parent then reacts angrily, saying the teacher is selfish and in it for money. The author is questioning if they're the asshole for not helping.\n\nSo, is the teacher at fault? Well, they were already doing a lot for their own students for free. They set clear boundaries about time and offered to help if the parent could meet the schedule. When that wasn't possible, they tried to offer a paid alternative. The parent's child is in a different district, so the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their own school. The teacher wasn't refusing help entirely; they just couldn't adjust their schedule and offered payment. The parent's reaction seems unreasonable, especially since the teacher is already volunteering their time and has valid reasons for not being able to adjust further. \n\nThe teacher's request for compensation for their time, especially when they're already giving up their own time without pay for their own students, isn't unreasonable. The parent's assumption that the teacher should do it for free because they're a public servant might be misplaced. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for payment when they can't adjust their schedule. The parent's outburst seems more about their expectations not being met rather than the teacher's actions being unethical. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong.\n"
