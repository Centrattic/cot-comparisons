The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to her own students because she can't charge them due to conflict of interest rules. She's already going above and beyond by providing snacks and spending her after-school time. Then, a parent from another school asks for tutoring for her son, who is in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because the other school lets out later, so the kid can't come at the same time as her current tutees.\n\nShe offers to tutor him separately but wants $25 per session, which is below the local going rate of $30. The parent gets angry and accuses her of not caring about kids and being selfish. The teacher is now questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the conflict of interest regarding charging her own students, but the new student is from a different school. So, there's no conflict here. However, the teacher is offering her services as a tutor, which isn't part of her school job responsibilities. She's doing this on her own time. \n\nBut wait, the parent is asking her to tutor a student from another school, which isn't her student. The teacher might not be obligated to help, especially since the logistics are tough. She's already stretched thin, working from 6:30 AM and driving home at 5:45 PM. She also has her own child's homework to help with. \n\nThe parent's reaction is extreme and uncalled for. The teacher set boundaries, and the parent reacted poorly. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting limits on her time and asking for compensation, especially since she's not affiliated with the other school. \n\nAlso, the parent approached her directly, not through the proper channels. The teacher might not even be allowed to tutor students from another school if there are district policies against it. But even assuming she can, the main issue is the parent's expectations and the teacher's right to charge for her time outside of her professional obligations. \n\nSo the answer is B. The teacher isn't in the wrong for not tutoring the student and asking for compensation when it's feasible for her.\n"
