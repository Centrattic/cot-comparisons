The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring for their own students because they can't charge due to conflict of interest rules. They mention that they're in a low-income area, so providing snacks is an added expense they cover themselves. Then a parent from another school contacts them, asking for tutoring for their son who's in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because the other school dismisses later, so the parent wants the teacher to adjust their schedule. The teacher refuses to change their existing schedule and offers paid tutoring instead, which leads to the parent getting angry.\n\nThe teacher's main points are that they can't charge their own students, they're already giving their time after school for free, and they have personal commitments. They're also considering the financial aspect\u2014tutors in the area charge $30/hour, and they asked for $25, which is reasonable. The parent accused them of not caring about kids and being selfish. \n\nSo, is the teacher in the wrong? The teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside their job, especially for a student not in their school. They're already providing free tutoring to their own students, which is commendable. The parent's request would require significant personal time and energy, which the teacher isn't willing to give for free. The teacher's decision to charge for the extra time is fair, given the local rates. The parent's reaction is hostile and unfair, attacking the teacher's character. \n\nThe teacher isn't the asshole here. They're being reasonable given their circumstances. The parent is the one being unreasonable, expecting free services and reacting negatively when boundaries are set. So, the answer should be B.\n"
