The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher offers free tutoring to their own students after school. A parent from another school asks for help with her son, who is in a different district and school. The teacher initially agrees but then realizes the logistical issues. The child can't arrive on time because of different dismissal times and driving distances. The teacher suggests tutoring separately and asks for $25 per session, which the parent reacted negatively to, calling the teacher names and accusing them of being in it for money.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which takes time and energy. They mention that they can't stay later because by 4:15, they're too exhausted. Plus, they have their own kid to take care of. So, the main conflict here is whether the teacher is obligated to provide unpaid tutoring for a student outside their school, especially when it's not feasible given their schedule and personal circumstances.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems harsh. The teacher isn't in a position to offer free tutoring to another student from a different school, especially when it's outside their own school's schedule and would require them to work beyond their already committed time. The teacher is also a parent themselves, dealing with personal responsibilities. Charging a reasonable rate for their time in this case might be justified, as they're not being compensated by the district for this extra work. \n\nThe parent's accusations that the teacher doesn't care about kids and is in it for money are unfounded. The teacher is already giving their time for free to their own students. The request here is outside the original scope, so the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. Also, the parent approached without considering the practicalities, so maybe the parent should have thought about the logistics first. \n\nIn conclusion, the teacher isn't being selfish; they're managing their own resources and time. The parent's expectations were unreasonable. The teacher's decision to charge is understandable, and they're not the asshole for not providing free tutoring under these circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
