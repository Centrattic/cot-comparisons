The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping the student from another school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring to her own students because the school district doesn't allow charging money for tutoring. She's already doing this for her own students, providing snacks, and spending her time. Now, a parent from another school contacts her, asking for tutoring for their child. The problem is that the child is in a different county, so logistically, it's hard to get there in time. The parent's son is behind in reading, so the teacher feels bad and says she'll tutor him if he can get there. But the kid can't arrive until 4:15 PM, which is after her own students' tutoring sessions. The teacher also has her own son to help with homework, and driving home takes 40 minutes. She offers to do it for $25 per session, which is less than the market rate of $30. The parent gets angry, accuses her of not caring about kids and being greedy.\n\nSo, the teacher is asking if she's an asshole for not helping. Let's see. She's already doing a lot for her own students for free. She's taking time out of her day, even paying for snacks. The new request is outside her school district, and timing is an issue. She's already exhausted by 4:15 PM. She's not allowed to charge her own students, but here she's willing to charge because it's a different student. The parent is upset about the charge.\n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Well, she's not obligated to help a student from another school. She's already doing her job for her own students. She's being reasonable about the time and compensation. The parent's reaction is unprofessional. The teacher isn't required to volunteer her time beyond her current commitments. Charging for services isn't inherently wrong, especially when it's outside her job scope. The parent's accusations are harsh and unfounded. The teacher's main priority is her own students and her family. So I think she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
