The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a teacher who offers free tutoring after school to their students, but a parent from another school asks for tutoring for their son who is in a different county. The teacher offers to do it for a fee, but the parent gets upset and calls them names. The question is whether the teacher is an asshole for not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The teacher works in a low-income area and already provides free tutoring, including snacks they pay for themselves. The parent's son is in a different school district, so the timing doesn't work. The parent then asks for separate sessions, which would require the teacher to stay later. The teacher asks for $25 per session, which is under the local rate. The parent reacts angrily, accusing the teacher of being selfish and only in it for money.\n\nNow, considering the teacher's position. They are already giving their time for free to their own students, which is a significant commitment. They can't tutor a student from another school because of logistical issues. When the parent asks for a different arrangement, the teacher sets a reasonable price. It's important that the teacher can't charge their own students, so taking a lower rate for someone else might be acceptable, but the parent is upset regardless.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems extreme. The teacher is trying to help but also has personal time and energy to consider. The teacher is not obligated to help a student outside their school, especially with the added time and effort. The parent's accusations of not caring and being selfish are unwarranted, given the teacher's existing efforts.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They were offering help beyond their duty, and when that's not feasible, setting a boundary is reasonable. The parent's expectations might have been unreasonable, expecting free help from a teacher who is already giving a lot. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
