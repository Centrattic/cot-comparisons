The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a first-grade teacher in a low-income rural area. They offer free tutoring sessions for their own students after school, providing snacks and using their own time. A parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son, who is in a different county and school. The teacher tried to help but realized the logistics were impossible. The parent then asked for separate sessions, but the teacher declined because they were too tired after a long day and had their own family responsibilities. When the teacher set a rate of $25 per session (significantly below the market rate of $30), the parent attacked them verbally, accusing them of being selfish and not caring about kids.\n\nThe question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping. Let's consider the key points. The teacher already offers free tutoring to their own students, which is commendable. They have limited time and energy, especially since they have their own son to take care of. The parent's child is in a different school district, making coordination difficult. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside their job, especially when it's not their student and the parent didn't initially disclose the logistical issues. Charging a low rate is reasonable given the time and effort, and the parent's reaction was hostile and unfounded. The teacher's decision to set boundaries is understandable, given the circumstances. Therefore, the teacher isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs and limitations.\n"
