The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not agreeing to tutor another student. The parent from a different school asked for help, but the timing was an issue. The teacher offered to do it for $25 per session, which is less than the market rate mentioned ($30). The parent got upset and made harsh comments.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring to their own students, which takes up their time after school. They have to drive home, help their own son with homework, and it's a tiring schedule. The parent's child is in a different county, so getting there on time is impossible. The teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside their school or district, especially since it's not part of their job. \n\nThe parent's reaction is pretty harsh. They accused the teacher of not caring about kids and being in it for money, which is unfair. The teacher was willing to compensate for the extra time by charging $25, which is reasonable. The parent didn't like that and took it personally, but the teacher isn't in the wrong here. They were already providing free services to their own students and can't be expected to go beyond their capacity. \n\nAlso, the teacher mentions that they can't charge their own students due to conflict of interest policies, so charging a different student might be a gray area. But even if they decided to charge the other parent, the parent's reaction is unwarranted. The teacher is not obligated to help, especially with the logistical challenges. \n\nSo, considering all that, the teacher isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
