The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not helping a student from a different school. The situation is about a teacher offering free tutoring sessions for their own students but being asked by a parent of a student from another school to provide tutoring as well, but this would require the teacher to adjust their schedule and charge a fee. The parent then gets angry and calls the teacher names.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which they fund themselves, including snacks. They have a set schedule, and the new request is from a student in a different county who can't attend the existing sessions. The teacher offers to help but needs to charge because of the time and energy involved. The parent reacts negatively, accusing the teacher of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they're not, but wants to know if I agree. The options are A or B.\n\nFrom the information given, the teacher is already doing a lot for their own students at their own expense. The new request involves a student from another school, which might not be within the teacher's responsibility. The teacher is also considering their own time and family obligations. The parent's reaction seems extreme, especially considering the teacher is offering to help for a fee, which is reasonable given the cost of tutoring in the area. The teacher isn't refusing help entirely but is setting boundaries due to personal and professional constraints. The parent's accusations don't seem fair because the teacher is asking for compensation, which is a valid request. The teacher isn't in the wrong for not providing free, unpaid help outside their contractual obligations. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
