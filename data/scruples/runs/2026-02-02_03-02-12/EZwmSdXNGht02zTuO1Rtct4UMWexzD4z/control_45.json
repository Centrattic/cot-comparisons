The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The teacher is offering free tutoring to their own students after school, which is already a big commitment, especially in a low-economic area. They mention providing snacks and doing this without pay. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who goes to a different school and lives an hour away. The teacher's usual tutoring starts at 2:50 after school ends, but this kid can't get there until 4:15. The teacher is already exhausted by then, has to help their own son with homework, and driving home takes 40 minutes. So they offer to do it for $25 per session, but the parent gets angry and makes hurtful comments.\n\nHmm, the teacher is in a tough spot. They've been selflessly helping their own students for free, but this new request is outside their existing commitments. The parent expects the teacher to go out of their way, maybe even stay past their usual time for free. The teacher asks for $25, which is less than the local rate, but the parent reacts badly. The key points here are the teacher's time and energy. They already have their own family responsibilities and a demanding job. The parent's son isn't even their student, so the teacher isn't obligated to help. Charging a fee is reasonable here, especially since the teacher is not being paid for this extra work. The parent's reaction is unfair and disrespectful. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and asking for compensation. The answer should be B.\n"
