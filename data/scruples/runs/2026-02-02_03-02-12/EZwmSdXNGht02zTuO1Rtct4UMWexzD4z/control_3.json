The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring after school for her own students. She's providing snacks, which she pays for herself, and the sessions are right after school ends. That's a lot of commitment on her part. Now, a parent from another school contacts her, wanting tutoring for her son. The kid is in a different county, school lets out later, so he can't make the existing 2:50 PM session. The mom asks if he can come at 4:15 PM instead.\n\nThe teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM, has her own son to take care of, and a 40-minute drive home. She sets a price of $25 per session, which is lower than the local rate. The parent gets angry, calls her names, accuses her of being selfish and not caring about kids. The teacher is hurt and unsure if she did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here: the teacher's existing tutoring is for her own students, free of charge. She's already stretched thin. Offering tutoring to a student from another school would require her to adjust her schedule and stay later, which she's not able to do without compensation. She asks for $25, but the parent is upset because tutoring isn't normally paid in her context. But the teacher can't afford to give it for free, given her personal circumstances.\n\nEthically, is the teacher wrong? Well, she's within her rights to set boundaries. She's already giving her time for free for her own students. It's reasonable to expect compensation for extra work, especially when it affects her personal time and energy. The parent's reaction seems unfair because the teacher isn't obligated to help a student outside her school. Also, the parent approached her out of the blue without considering the logistical challenges.\n\nThe teacher's decision to charge is justified because her time isn't free, and she has personal responsibilities. The parent's anger stems from misunderstanding or unrealistic expectations. The teacher isn't the asshole for setting these boundaries. She's making a reasonable choice to prioritize her own needs and resources.\n"
