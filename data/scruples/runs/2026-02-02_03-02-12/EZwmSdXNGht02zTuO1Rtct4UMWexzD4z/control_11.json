The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether she should tutor a student from another school. First, she already offers free tutoring for her own students, which she does on her own time and at her own expense. Then a parent from another school asks her to tutor their child as well.\n\nThe key points here are the logistics. The other school is in a different county and releases later, so the child can't make it to her tutoring session right after school ends. The parent asked if she could start the session later, around 4:15. The teacher says she's too tired by then and also needs to help her own son, which takes time. She offered to do it for $25 per session, but the parent got really angry and accused her of not caring about the kids.\n\nSo, the question is whether the teacher is wrong for not helping. Let's break this down. She's already volunteering her time and resources for her own students without getting paid. The other parent is asking her to extend that help to their child, but there's a logistical problem. The teacher can't adjust her schedule because of her own commitments and fatigue. She tries to offer a solution by charging, which the parent refuses. \n\nIs the teacher obligated to help? Probably not. She's not bound to take on extra students outside her own school, especially when there are practical issues. The parent's reaction seems unreasonable because they expected free help. The teacher is under no obligation to provide services outside her job or without compensation for her time. Charging for that time is reasonable, especially considering she's already giving up her time for free for others. The parent's accusations about her motives don't hold water here; she's just setting boundaries for her time and energy. \n\nSo, I think the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's managing her own resources and time appropriately. The parent's anger stems from a misunderstanding of her limits and expectations. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
