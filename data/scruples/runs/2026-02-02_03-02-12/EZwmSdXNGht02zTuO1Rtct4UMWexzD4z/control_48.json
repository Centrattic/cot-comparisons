The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping the student from another school. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring to her own students after school. She provides snacks and spends her own time and money. That's a lot of effort. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher would tutor her son, who's in a different county. The timing doesn't work because the other school lets out later. The teacher had initially agreed to help if the kid could make it on time, but since that's impossible, the parent wants the teacher to adjust her schedule.\n\nThe teacher is already working late, gets home around 5:45 PM, and then has to help her own son with homework. She's exhausted. So she offers to tutor for $25 per session, which is below the local rate of $30/hour. The parent reacts angrily, making personal attacks.\n\nNow, is the teacher in the wrong? Well, she's already giving her time for free to her own students. The new request would require her to extend her work hours even more, which she's not obligated to do. Plus, she's asking for compensation for her time, which seems reasonable given the effort involved. The parent's expectation that the teacher should work beyond her capacity for free might be unreasonable. The teacher isn't required to tutor outside her job, especially for a student not under her direct responsibility. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The parent's anger stems from not considering the teacher's existing workload and personal time.\n"
