The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The teacher already tutors her own students for free, provides snacks, and does it after school. When another parent asks for tutoring for their child from a different school, the teacher is willing to help if the child can come on time. But the child's school ends later, so he can't make it. The parent then asks if the teacher can wait for him later. The teacher says she can't because she's too tired and needs to get home. She offers to tutor for $25 instead. The parent gets angry and calls her names.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already giving her time for free for her own students. She's in a low-income area, so she's probably not getting paid much. She's also paying for snacks and spending her own time. That's a lot of personal effort. Then the parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, which isn't in the same school, so the logistics are complicated. The teacher isn't obligated to help other students outside her school, especially since there's a policy against charging her own students. She's trying to set a boundary here. The parent is upset because she's not getting free help, which the teacher was already providing for her own students. The teacher asks for $25, which is below the market rate, but the parent is offended. \n\nThe main points are about boundaries and compensation. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting limits on her time and expecting to be paid for extra work. She's already doing a lot without pay. The parent is in the wrong for expecting free help for another school's child and then attacking the teacher. So the answer should be B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
