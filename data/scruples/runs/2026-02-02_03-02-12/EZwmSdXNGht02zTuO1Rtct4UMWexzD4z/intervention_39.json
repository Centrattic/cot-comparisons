The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is asking if they're an asshole for not helping a student from another school. The situation is that they offer free tutoring to their own students after school, but a parent from another school asked if they could tutor her son. The teacher said they could do it if the kid could make it on time, but the kid's school ends 30 minutes later, so he can't. Then the parent wants the teacher to adjust their schedule to accommodate the kid arriving at 4:15 PM. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 and has other commitments, so they propose charging $25 per session instead of doing it for free. The parent gets angry and insults the teacher.\n\nFirst, the teacher is doing free tutoring for their own students already. That's a generous act, especially in a low-economic area. They even pay for snacks themselves. Now, someone from another school is asking for help, but the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their own school. The parent's son isn't in their class, so there's no professional responsibility there.\n\nThe timing issue is a problem. The teacher's usual sessions start at 2:50, but the other kid can't make it until 4:15. The teacher is already wiped by then and has to pick up their own son and help with homework. It's reasonable for the teacher to say they can't do it for free when they're already giving up their time for their own students. \n\nAsking for $25 is fair because they're offering their time and expertise outside their normal duties. The parent's reaction is extreme. They accused the teacher of not caring and being selfish, which doesn't make sense because the teacher is already helping their own students for free. The parent expected free help without considering the teacher's limitations.\n\nThe teacher isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to tutor outside their school or for extra hours without compensation. The parent's demands were unreasonable given the circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
