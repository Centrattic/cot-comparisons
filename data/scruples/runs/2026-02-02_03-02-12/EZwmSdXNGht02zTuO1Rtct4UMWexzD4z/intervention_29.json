The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring for their own students because they can't charge due to conflict of interest rules. The parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher says yes if the child can come on time, but the child's school ends late. Then the parent asks if the teacher can wait until 4:15 when the kid arrives. The teacher is already tired by then and has other commitments, so they ask for $25 per session instead of the usual $30 market rate. The parent gets angry and calls the teacher names.\n\nFirst, the teacher isn't in the wrong for not providing free tutoring. They're already doing this for their own students without pay, so expecting them to do the same for someone else's child from a different school doesn't make sense. Charging a fee in this case is reasonable because the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their own students. The parent's reaction is harsh and unfair. The teacher is also dealing with personal time and energy, especially after a long day. The parent's accusations about the teacher caring only about money are baseless given the teacher's existing free tutoring efforts. The main issue is the parent's unrealistic expectation and the teacher's right to set boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
