The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area and offers free tutoring after school. She's already giving her time and money for her own students. A parent from another school asks for her help with her son, who is in a different county and can't make the existing schedule. The teacher offers to do it for $25 per session, which is less than the local market rate. The parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of being selfish and only in it for money.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring, which is a big commitment. She's using her own funds for snacks and her own time. The parent's child can't fit into the existing schedule, so she's being asked to make an exception. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside her school, especially since the child is in another county. She's also taking into account her own time and energy, as she gets home late and has her own child to assist with homework. \n\nThe parent's reaction is extreme and disrespectful. The teacher's asking for compensation is reasonable given the time and effort involved. She's not a professional tutor, but since the market rate is $30/hour, $25 is fair. The parent's accusations that she's selfish or doesn't care about kids are unfair, especially since she's already helping others for free. \n\nThe teacher is within her rights to say no or set boundaries. She's not in the wrong for setting limits on her time and energy, especially when it's outside her responsibilities. The parent's behavior is the issue here, not the teacher's decision to charge for additional help that's not feasible in her current schedule.\n"
