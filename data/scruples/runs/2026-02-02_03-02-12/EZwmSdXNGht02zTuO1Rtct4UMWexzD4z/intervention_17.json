The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is being asked to tutor a student from another school district. The original tutoring sessions are for her own students, free of charge, with snacks she pays for herself. The parent of another student wants her to tutor their child, but there's a logistical issue because the other school lets out later. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM and has her own son to help with homework, plus the drive home. She offers to tutor for $25 per session, which is below the local market rate. The parent reacts angrily, accusing her of self-interest and not caring about kids.\n\nSo the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping. The user thinks she's not, and I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, the teacher already provides free tutoring for her own students. She's going the extra mile by offering snacks and doing this without pay. The parent is asking for a favor for a different district's student, which isn't her responsibility. The teacher is under no obligation to help beyond her own students. She's already stretched thin, both in terms of time and energy, and has a valid reason to decline further unpaid help. When she offers to charge, it's reasonable given the time and effort required. The parent's outburst is unprofessional and unfair. The teacher isn't at fault here. She's not required to work for free, especially for a different district's student. So the answer should be B.\n"
