The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring sessions after school for her own students. She has a set time, provides snacks, and does it all voluntarily. Then a parent from another school contacts her because their child needs help. The teacher agrees to tutor if the child can make it on time, but the child is in a different county and can't arrive until 4:15, which is after school. The teacher's offer was conditional on the child arriving on time. Now the parent wants her to adjust her schedule to accommodate the late arrival. \n\nThe teacher is already exhausted by 4:15, has her own son's homework to help with, and the drive home would take over an hour. She asks for $25 per session as compensation. The parent reacts angrily, accusing her of not caring about kids and being in it for money. The teacher feels hurt and is questioning if she did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here: The teacher's initial offer was conditional. She was clear about the time requirements. The parent's child didn't meet those conditions. The teacher then offers to adjust but asks for payment because she's giving up her personal time, which is reasonable given that she's not getting paid for this tutoring. The parent's reaction is hostile. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? She was clear with her terms. She's not obligated to provide free tutoring outside her job's hours, especially for a student not in her own school. The parent's child doesn't meet the initial conditions, so the teacher isn't at fault for not changing her schedule without fair compensation. The parent's anger seems unwarranted. So, the answer should be B (No), the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
