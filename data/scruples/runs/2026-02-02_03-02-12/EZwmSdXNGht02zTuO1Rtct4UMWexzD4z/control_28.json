The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring after school to their own students. They provide snacks and do this out of their own pocket. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, who is in a different county and school that dismisses later. The teacher initially thought maybe the parent could get the kid there on time, but it's not possible. So the parent suggests tutoring separately. The teacher says they can't do it for free because they get home too late and have other responsibilities. They offer to do it for $25 an hour, which is under the going rate. The parent gets really angry, accuses the teacher of not caring and being selfish.\n\nSo, the teacher's position is that they're already giving their time and resources to their own students, and this new request would require them to stay even later, which isn't feasible. They're also a parent themselves with their own child's homework. They tried to offer a solution but at a rate lower than market, but the parent was upset about the cost.\n\nIs the teacher wrong? Well, the teacher is already doing free tutoring for their own students. They're not obligated to help students outside their school, especially when it would add more personal burden. The parent from another school is asking for a favor that's outside the teacher's normal responsibilities. The teacher is asking for compensation because they can't do it for free anymore. It's reasonable for them to set boundaries. The parent's reaction seems harsh and unfair, especially since the teacher is offering to help at a lower rate than the market. So the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
