The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher in the given situation is in the wrong. So, the teacher offers free tutoring after school, but when a parent from another school asks for tutoring for their child, they can't attend the same session. The teacher offers to do it separately but charges $25 per session. The parent gets upset and accuses the teacher of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which takes time and energy. The new parent's child is in a different school and county, so timing is an issue. The teacher's own son needs help with homework, and driving home takes time. The teacher asks for $25, which is less than the going rate of $30. The parent reacts negatively.\n\nNow, considering the context. The teacher is in a rural, low-income area. They already do this for free, using their own money for snacks. They can't take the new student during the existing sessions because of logistical issues. Offering separate sessions would require the teacher to stay late, which is tiring, and then drive home late, which affects their ability to help their own child. The parent's reaction seems harsh.\n\nIs the teacher wrong for not helping? Well, the teacher isn't obligated to help outside their commitments. They already offer free tutoring where possible. Charging for time when it's not feasible to do it for free is reasonable. The parent's accusations about the teacher caring only for money are baseless because the teacher provides free help. The teacher is in a tough spot, balancing personal and professional time. The parent's expectations might be unreasonable given the circumstances. So, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). They made a reasonable decision based on their situation.\n"
