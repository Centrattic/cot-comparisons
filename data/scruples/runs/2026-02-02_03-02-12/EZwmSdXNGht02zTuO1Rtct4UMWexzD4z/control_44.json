The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student from a different school. The teacher already tutors kids after school for free, which is a big deal because they can't charge their own students. They provide snacks, which they pay for themselves. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, but he's in a different county and leaves school later. The teacher says that if the kid can make it by 2:50, they'll help. But the kid gets out at a later time, so the parent asks if the teacher can wait until 4:15. The teacher feels they can't do that because they're exhausted by then, have to help their own son, and the drive home would take up their evening. So they offer to charge $25 per session instead. The parent yells at them, calling them selfish and not caring about kids.\n\nHmm. The teacher is already doing a lot for their own students without pay. They can't tutor the other kid during their regular time because of scheduling and personal commitments. Offering to charge a fee seems reasonable since it would require extra time outside their usual routine. The parent's reaction is pretty harsh, especially given that the teacher is trying to help but can't accommodate the different schedule without compensation. The teacher isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to provide free tutoring beyond their own students, especially when it's not feasible. Charging a fair rate for additional time is justified. The parent's accusations are unfair because the teacher is willing to help but needs to set boundaries. So the answer should be B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
