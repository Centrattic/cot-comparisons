The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The teacher already offers free tutoring to their own students at a specific time after school. A parent from another school asked if the teacher would tutor her son, but he's from a different county and school with later dismissal times. The teacher said they'd need to charge $25 per session, which led to the parent getting upset and accusing the teacher of being selfish.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring to their own students, which is a commendable effort, especially given the rural and low-economic context. They even pay for snacks themselves, so they're going above and beyond. When the other parent asked, the teacher tried to accommodate but realized the logistical issues. The child can't get there in time because of the school's later dismissal. \n\nThe parent then wants the teacher to wait until her son arrives at 4:15. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15, has to drive home, and help their own son with homework. The teacher offers to tutor for $25, which is below the local going rate. The parent reacts negatively, calling the teacher names and accusing them of not caring.\n\nThe key points here: The teacher is not obligated to tutor students outside their own school. They were already providing free tutoring for their own students. The parent is asking for a significant time commitment after work, which the teacher can't handle due to personal responsibilities. The teacher offered to charge a rate lower than market to help, but the parent refused. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems unreasonable. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They can't be expected to work extra hours for free, especially when it's not their student and there are practical limitations. The teacher's decision to ask for compensation is fair, given the time and effort required beyond their existing commitments. The parent's accusations are unfair and don't acknowledge the teacher's existing efforts to help others without charge. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
