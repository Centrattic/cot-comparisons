The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The situation involves a teacher who offers free tutoring sessions for their own students. A parent from another school asked if the teacher could tutor her son, but there are logistical issues because he's in a different county and school ends later. The teacher offered to do it separately but asked for $25 per session, which the parent reacted angrily to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is commendable. They mention that they can't charge their own students due to conflict of interest policies. When the parent from another district asks for help, the teacher is faced with a situation where accommodating this would require significant personal sacrifice. The teacher works long hours, gets home late, and has their own family responsibilities. Offering to tutor this student would extend their workday by almost two hours, which is a lot.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems extreme. The teacher is asking for compensation because their time is valuable, especially considering the local tutoring rates. The parent's accusations that the teacher is selfish or only in it for money seem unfounded because the teacher already gives their time for free to their own students. The fact that the parent couldn't get the child there on time is a logistical hurdle that the teacher might not be able to overcome without adjusting their own schedule, which isn't feasible.\n\nI should also think about the policies. The teacher's district has rules against charging their own students, but this is a different student from another county. However, the teacher is still an employee of the district and might have policies against personal tutoring, even if it's outside of school hours. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal or policy violations. The teacher's decision to ask for payment could be seen as reasonable given the time and effort required, especially since it's not their responsibility to tutor students from another school.\n\nThe parent's anger seems misplaced. The teacher isn't obligated to help students outside their school, especially when it creates a significant burden. The teacher's main responsibility is to their own students and their family. The parent's assumption that the teacher should do this for free without considering the teacher's time and energy is where the issue lies.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They offered help when possible and tried to accommodate within their means. The parent's reaction is the problem here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
