The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not agreeing to tutor the child from another school. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The teacher offers free tutoring after school for her own students, paying for snacks herself. A parent from another school (different county) asks if the teacher would tutor her son, even though he's not her student. The teacher initially agreed to help if the kid could make it on time, but the school dismisses later. The mom then wants the teacher to wait until 4:15 PM. The teacher is already tired by 4:15, has her own son to help with homework, and a long drive home. She offers to tutor for $25 an hour, which the parent is upset about.\n\nThe teacher is wondering if she's in the wrong. The user thinks she's not. I need to decide based on the scenario.\n\nKey points: The teacher is already providing free tutoring for her own students, which she's doing on her own time and money. The other parent is asking the teacher to extend this service to a student outside her school, which would require significant personal sacrifice. The teacher sets a boundary by offering to charge for the time, but the parent reacts negatively.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the teacher isn't obligated to help a student who isn't hers. She's already doing a lot for her own students without compensation. The parent's expectation that the teacher should do the same for their child might be unreasonable. The teacher's request for payment is reasonable given the time and effort required. The parent's reaction seems harsh and unfair.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Maybe the teacher could have said no without offering payment, but she tried to accommodate by offering a fee. The parent's anger might stem from not understanding the teacher's personal constraints. The teacher has a right to set boundaries, especially when her own responsibilities are in play.\n\nNo signs that the teacher is acting out of greed. She's providing snacks for her own students but not for another. The parent's son is in another school, so the teacher isn't required to help. The teacher is clear about the terms, and the parent is upset, but that doesn't make the teacher wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The teacher is justified in setting limits on her time and seeking compensation for the additional work.\n"
