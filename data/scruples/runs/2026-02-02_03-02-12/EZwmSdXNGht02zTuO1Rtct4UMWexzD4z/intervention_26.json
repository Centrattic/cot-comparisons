The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. The situation is that the author is a first-grade teacher in a rural, low-income area. They offer free tutoring after school for their own students, including snacks they pay for. A parent from another school asked the teacher to tutor her son, who is in a different county and school that dismisses later. The teacher offered to tutor if the child could get there on time, but when the parent realized it wasn't possible, she asked for a different time. The teacher said they'd need to pay $25 per session, which the parent got angry about, calling the teacher names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's situation. They already provide free tutoring for their own students, which takes time and energy. The parent is asking for a significant time shift\u2014tutoring after 4:15 PM, which is when the teacher is already exhausted and has her own son to take care of. The teacher is also commuting home, which adds 40 minutes. She's not getting paid by the school for this extra work, and the local tutoring rate is $30/hour, so she's asking $25, which is less than market rate.\n\nThe parent's reaction is harsh. She attacks the teacher's motives and character. But the teacher's offer was conditional on the child's availability and then on compensation. The parent didn't mention the logistics issue initially, which the teacher couldn't have known. The teacher isn't obligated to help students outside her own school or district. She's already giving of her time and resources without pay. Asking for compensation for extra hours is reasonable, especially since she's not getting school support for this. The parent's expectation that the teacher should do it for free, despite the personal sacrifices, might be the issue here.\n\nThe teacher isn't in the wrong because she's setting boundaries. She's not required to extend her services beyond her school, especially when it affects her personal time and well-being. The parent's anger stems from not considering the teacher's circumstances. So, the answer is B.\n"
