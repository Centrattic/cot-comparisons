The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the teacher in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school district by charging for tutoring. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The teacher already provides free tutoring for their own students, which is generous, especially since it's in a low-income area. They even pay for snacks themselves. So, the teacher isn't making money here; it's a volunteer effort.\n\nThen, a parent from another school asks for tutoring for their child. The teacher initially agrees but realizes the logistical issues\u2014the other school dismisses later, so the child can't make the existing sessions. The parent wants a separate session. The teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM and has other commitments like helping their own son with homework. They offer to do it for $25 per session, which is under the market rate.\n\nThe parent gets angry, calling the teacher names and accusing them of not caring about kids. The teacher is upset and questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points here are whether the teacher is justified in charging for the extra time. The teacher's existing tutoring is unpaid, and they're offering to help outside their normal capacity. Charging a fair rate seems reasonable, especially since they're sacrificing their personal time. The parent's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. The teacher isn't obligated to help, especially with the added strain on their time and energy. Also, the parent's child is from a different district, so it's not the teacher's responsibility. \n\nThe teacher also mentions that in their district, charging for tutoring is a conflict of interest, but since this is outside their school's framework, they can set their own rate. The parent's accusations about money are unfair because the teacher is already giving their time for free in other cases. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the teacher isn't in the wrong). They're justified in setting boundaries and expecting compensation for their time when it's outside their existing commitments. The parent's reaction is unreasonable.\n"
