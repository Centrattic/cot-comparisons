The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the teacher is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the teacher offers free tutoring after school for their own students. A parent from another school asks if they can have the teacher tutor their child, but the timing doesn't work out because the child is in a different county. The teacher offers to do it separately but charges $25 per session, which the parent is upset about. The parent insults the teacher, saying they care only about money.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which they can't charge for due to district policies. That's commendable. They're even paying for snacks themselves, which shows they're invested. Now, the parent from another school is asking for help, but the timing is an issue. The teacher's schedule is tight: they get home around 5:45 after driving 40 minutes, and then help their own son. The teacher probably doesn't have the capacity to take on another student without compensation, especially since they can't charge their own students.\n\nWhen the parent asks for separate tutoring, the teacher offers to do it for $25/hour. The parent reacts negatively, accusing the teacher of being selfish. The key here is whether the teacher was wrong to charge. Since the teacher can't charge their own students (conflict of interest), but this is a different student from another school, maybe there's no policy against it. However, the teacher is still a public figure, and charging a parent might be seen as exploiting their position. But the teacher isn't obligated to help, and the parent's child isn't their student. The teacher is within their rights to say no or charge a reasonable fee, especially considering the time and energy required.\n\nThe parent's reaction is clearly inappropriate\u2014calling names and making hurtful comments. The teacher's decision to charge might be justified because they're giving up their personal time, which they'd otherwise use to help their own child. The main issue is whether the teacher overstepped by charging. But since there's no policy against it and they're not required to help, the teacher isn't in the wrong. The parent is the one being unreasonable here. So the answer is B.\n"
