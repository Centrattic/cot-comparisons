The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring after school for her own students. A parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child as well. The teacher agrees but then realizes the logistical issues\u2014the other school lets out later, so the kid would arrive after her usual sessions. She offers to do it separately but when she asks for $25 per session, the parent gets really angry and insults her.\n\nSo the question is, is the teacher in the wrong? The user thinks she's not. Let's consider points on both sides.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for her own students, which shows she's willing to help. She's even paying for snacks herself. She's in a rural, low-income area, so the parent might expect free help. But she's not required to tutor outside her job. She's working a full day, gets home late, and has her own child to help. Asking for compensation is reasonable since her time is valuable. However, charging a different student from another school might be a conflict of interest or against school policies. Also, the parent might have felt that because she's a teacher, the service should be free. But the teacher isn't obligated to help beyond her job. The parent's reaction was extreme, but the teacher's refusal to provide free help when it's not feasible isn't necessarily wrong. She's managing her own energy and responsibilities. So the answer seems to be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
