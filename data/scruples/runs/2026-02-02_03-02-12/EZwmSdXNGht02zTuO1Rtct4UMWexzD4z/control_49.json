The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring to their own students, which is already a big deal because they're working in a low-income area and spending their own money on snacks. That shows they care.\n\nNow, a parent from another school reaches out, asking for the teacher to tutor her child. The problem is that the child is in a different county and school, which dismisses later. The teacher had agreed under the condition that the child could make it on time, but that's not possible. The parent then asks if the teacher can adjust their schedule to wait for her son. \n\nThe teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM because they get to work at 6:30 AM. Plus, they have their own son's homework to help with. Driving home takes 40 minutes, so getting home by 5:45 PM. They offer to tutor for $25 per session, which is below the market rate of $30. The parent reacts badly, calling the teacher names and accusing them of being selfish and uninterested in kids.\n\nSo, the teacher was clear about the time constraints and tried to accommodate but couldn't due to practical reasons. They also offered compensation, which the parent didn't expect. The parent's reaction is harsh and unfair. The teacher isn't in the wrong for not helping because the circumstances make it impossible, and they were reasonable in their offer. The parent's expectations might not have considered the teacher's workload and personal time. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
