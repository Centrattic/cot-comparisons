The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a first-grade teacher who offers free tutoring to their own students after school. They provide snacks and do this without getting paid, which is a conflict of interest in their district. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son, even though he's in a different county and school. The teacher offers to do so if the child can make it on time, but the parent's kid can't arrive until 4:15, which is after the teacher's usual tutoring time. The teacher then asks for $25 per session to compensate for their time. The parent gets angry, calls the teacher names, and accuses her of not caring about kids. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping without compensation.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students. There's no obligation to extend that to other students, especially from a different school and county. The teacher's time is limited; she gets to work early and has her own son to help with in the evenings. Offering to tutor an additional student would take up more time, especially after the usual tutoring sessions. She's already going out of her way to provide free services, and the parent is asking her to extend that further without considering her schedule or the need for compensation. \n\nThe teacher's district policy doesn't allow charging students for tutoring, which is why she can't charge the ones she's already tutoring. But in this case, the new student is from another school, so maybe the policy doesn't apply? The teacher decides to charge $25 per session, which is under the market rate. The parent's reaction seems extreme. The teacher isn't obligated to help, and asking for fair compensation isn't unreasonable. The parent's accusations about the teacher caring only for money seem unfounded given the teacher's existing unpaid work.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's within her rights to set boundaries and ask for compensation for her time, especially when it's outside her usual commitments. The parent overreacted. Answer B.\n"
