The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring a student from another school, especially after the parent reacted negatively when the teacher asked for compensation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students, which is a generous gesture. They mention that they pay for snacks and that their school has policies against charging for tutoring. So, when the parent from another school asks for help, the teacher is probably already stretched thin. \n\nThe key points here are the logistics. The other student's school ends later, making it impossible to join the existing session. Then the parent wants separate sessions. The teacher gets home at 5:45 PM and has to help their own child with homework. That's a lot to manage. \n\nWhen the teacher suggests charging $25 per session, the parent gets angry and accuses them of not caring. The teacher's main concern is their own time and ability to manage their workload. They\u2019re not being paid for this extra work, and they have personal responsibilities too. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems harsh and unfair. The teacher didn't have to offer the tutoring in the first place. They provided a reasonable rate, but the parent lashed out. The teacher's decision to ask for compensation is understandable, especially since they're providing their time and expertise. \n\nAlso, considering the rural, low-economic area mentioned, the teacher might be doing this out of goodwill, but they can't be expected to give up their personal time without any compensation, especially when it affects their own family obligations. The parent's accusations that the teacher is selfish or only in it for money don't hold up when the teacher is already giving free sessions and the additional tutoring is outside their capacity.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They set boundaries, asked for a fair rate, and the parent overreacted. The answer is B.\n"
