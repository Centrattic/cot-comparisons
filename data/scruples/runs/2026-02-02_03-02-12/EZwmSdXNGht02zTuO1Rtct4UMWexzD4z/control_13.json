The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the teacher here is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring to her own students, which is after school and includes a snack she pays for. She's in a rural, low-income area, so she's already giving a lot of her time and resources for the kids she teaches. Now, a parent from another school contacts her, asking if she can tutor their son, who's in a different county and school. The timing doesn't work because the other school lets out later, so the student can't make the original session. The parent wants a separate session, which would start at 4:15 PM. The teacher says she's too tired by then and has her own son to take care of after work. She offers to do it for $25 per session, but the parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of being selfish and not caring about kids.\n\nThe teacher is asking if she's an asshole for not tutoring the other student. The key points here are her willingness to tutor her own students for free, the logistical challenges of timing and her own energy, and the fact that she's offering a lower rate than the market rate to help out. The parent's reaction is clearly harsh, but is the teacher in the wrong?\n\nI think the teacher isn't in the wrong. She's already doing a lot for her own students without pay. The other student is in a different school and county, which adds complications. She's being reasonable about her time and energy, especially after a long day. Asking for compensation isn't unreasonable, especially since she's giving up her own time. The parent's anger stems from not getting the help for free, possibly expecting the teacher to do it out of the goodness of her heart beyond her capacity. The teacher isn't obligated to help outside her job duties, and setting boundaries is important. So, answer B: the teacher is not in the wrong.\n"
