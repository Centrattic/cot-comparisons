The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The teacher here is tutoring students for free after school, providing snacks, and it's part of their role. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher agrees to help but only if the kid can come on time. When it turns out the kid can't, the teacher offers to tutor separately but charges $25 per session. The parent gets angry and calls the teacher names.\n\nSo, the question is whether the teacher is in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, the teacher is already doing a lot for free, which is commendable. They're providing snacks, spending their own time, and the district doesn't allow charging for tutoring. When the parent asks for help, the teacher is kind enough to consider it. However, the logistics are impossible because the student can't arrive on time. The teacher then offers to adjust but needs compensation because they're already drained after a long day and have their own responsibilities. \n\nThe parent's reaction seems excessive. The teacher is not obligated to provide free tutoring outside their school or district. Charging for their time is reasonable, especially when the teacher is already working unpaid hours. The parent's accusations about the teacher not caring are unfair given the context. The teacher's primary responsibility is to their own students and school. \n\nAlso, considering the teacher's energy and time, it's understandable they want to set boundaries. They can't be expected to work beyond their capacity without fair compensation. The parent's outburst and insults are unprofessional and disrespectful. \n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. They were already doing a good deed, tried to accommodate, but had legitimate reasons to charge when the situation required extra time and effort. The parent's reaction is the real issue here. Answer B.\n"
