The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students, which is already a big commitment. They provide snacks, do it after school, and it's unpaid. Then a parent from another school contacts them about tutoring her son. The problem is that the kid goes to a different school in another county, which is an hour away and dismisses later. So getting him to the tutor's location on time isn't feasible. \n\nThe teacher offered to tutor him separately, but then realized that by 4:15 PM, they're already exhausted from work, need to drive home, and help their own son with homework. They asked for $25 per session as compensation since they're not getting paid by the district for this extra work. The parent got really upset, called them names, and accused them of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nHmm. The teacher is in a low-economic area, so they might be aware of the financial constraints. But they're also a teacher with their own family obligations. The key points here are: the teacher is already providing free tutoring, the new request is outside their school's jurisdiction, and they're asking for a reasonable rate. The parent's reaction seems excessive. \n\nIs the teacher wrong for not helping? Well, they can't ethically tutor another school's student for free, especially when they have their own commitments. They offered to do it for a fee, which is fair since their time is valuable. The parent's anger stems from expecting free help, maybe not understanding the teacher's limitations. The teacher isn't obligated to help, especially when it's not their student. So the answer is B, the teacher isn't in the wrong.\n"
