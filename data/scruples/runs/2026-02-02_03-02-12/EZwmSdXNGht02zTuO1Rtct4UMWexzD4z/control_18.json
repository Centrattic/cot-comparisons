The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping another student outside of their school. The teacher offers free tutoring after school for their own students, including a snack they pay for. A parent from another school asked if the teacher could tutor her son, but he's in a different county, so he can't make the regular sessions. The teacher offered to tutor separately but asked for $25 per session. The parent flipped out, calling the teacher names and accusing them of being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the teacher's perspective. They're already giving their time for free, paying for snacks, and tutoring after a long workday. They have personal responsibilities like helping their own son with homework. The parent's son isn't even in their school, so it's an extra burden. The teacher asked for a reasonable rate, considering the local going rate is $30. They might feel that since they can't do it for free, charging a fee is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent might feel that as a teacher, the person should be more altruistic, especially in a low-income area. But the teacher is also human, with their own limits. The parent's reaction seems harsh, especially since the teacher was willing to help if the child could attend the existing sessions. When that wasn't possible, the teacher proposed a separate arrangement with a fee, which is fair given the time and effort required.\n\nThe teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside of their school or for free. They have boundaries, and setting them isn't wrong. The parent's accusations about the teacher's motives are unwarranted. The teacher tried to accommodate initially but had valid reasons for needing compensation when it wasn't feasible otherwise. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
