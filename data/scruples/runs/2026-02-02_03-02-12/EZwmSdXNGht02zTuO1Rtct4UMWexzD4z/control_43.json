The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the teacher in the given scenario is in the wrong for not agreeing to tutor another student from a different school. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already offering free tutoring sessions after school. They mention that the students come from a low-economic area, so they provide snacks and don't charge. The parent approached them about tutoring her son, who is in a different school and county. The teacher said they would help if the kid could come on time, but the timing doesn't work because the other school dismisses later. The parent then wants separate sessions, which would have the child arrive at 4:15. The teacher is exhausted by then, needs to help their own son, and drives home. So they asked for $25 per session, but the parent got angry and accused them of not caring about kids and being selfish.\n\nNow, the teacher is wondering if they're an asshole for not helping. The user wants to know if the author (the teacher) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Let's consider the teacher's position. They're already working long hours, providing free tutoring, and spending their own money on snacks. They have personal commitments after work, which is understandable. Asking for compensation for additional time seems fair, especially since they're not getting paid for the extra tutoring they already do. The parent's child is in a different school, so the teacher isn't obligated to help. Also, the timing issue makes it impossible to fit the new session into the existing schedule without adding a lot of personal time and effort.\n\nThe parent's reaction is extreme and unfair. The teacher isn't being selfish; they're managing their own resources and time. They made a reasonable offer for compensation, which is in line with market rates. The parent's accusations are baseless given the situation. The teacher isn't in the wrong here because they're setting boundaries and valuing their time appropriately. So the answer should be B (no).\n"
