The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher offers free tutoring after school for her own students, providing snacks and using her own time. A parent from another school asks if she can tutor their child, who is in a different county and has a later dismissal. The teacher agrees to tutor if the child can come on time, but when the parent tries to arrange for the child to arrive later, the teacher is too tired and has to leave for her own family. She offers to tutor for $25 per session, which the parent attacks her for. The question is whether the teacher is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot by offering free tutoring, which is commendable. She's in a rural, low-income area, so her efforts are significant. She's even providing snacks herself. The parent is asking for something outside her existing commitments. The child in question is from another school, so there's no obligation for her to help. The parent's son isn't her student, so she isn't responsible for his education. The teacher's time is limited; she gets home around 5:45 after driving, and then has to help her own son. It's reasonable for her to decline or set boundaries. When she does offer to tutor for a fee, the parent reacts negatively. Charging $25 isn't unreasonable considering the local market rate for tutors. The parent's insults are unwarranted because the teacher isn't obligated to help. The teacher isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and seeking compensation for her time. So the answer should be B.\n"
