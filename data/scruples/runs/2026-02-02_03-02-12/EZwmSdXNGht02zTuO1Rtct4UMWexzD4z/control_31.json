The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. So I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the teacher offers free tutoring after school for their own students. They provide snacks and do it for forty-five minutes. Then a parent from another school contacts them, asking if they can tutor her son, who's in a different county and school. The teacher agrees initially, thinking the timing works, but then realizes it's impossible because the other school dismisses later. The parent is upset when the teacher asks for $25 per session. The parent accuses the teacher of being selfish and not caring about the kids.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the teacher is already providing free tutoring for their own students, which is a significant commitment. They're asking for compensation for extra time when tutoring a student from another school. The parent is angry because she expected the same free help. The teacher has their own family responsibilities and energy limits. \n\nThe main question is whether the teacher is wrong. Legally and ethically, the teacher isn't obligated to tutor another school's student. The district has a policy against charging for tutoring their own students, but this is a different case. The teacher is offering paid tutoring, which is allowed since it's outside their official duties. The parent's expectation was unmet, but the teacher isn't required to say yes. Also, the parent's reaction is aggressive and unfair. The teacher's time and resources are their own, and they can set boundaries. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The teacher isn't obligated to help beyond their own students, and asking for compensation is reasonable given the extra time and effort. The parent's anger doesn't make the teacher wrong in this situation.\n"
