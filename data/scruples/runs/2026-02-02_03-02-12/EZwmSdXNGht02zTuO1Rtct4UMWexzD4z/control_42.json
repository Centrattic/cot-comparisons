The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the teacher (the author) is wrong for not tutoring another student from a different county. The situation is that the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students, paying for snacks and using their own time. A parent from another school asks if they can get extra help, but the timing is impossible, so the teacher offers to do it for $25 per session. The parent gets angry and insults the teacher.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already providing a service for free. They're using their own time, money for snacks, and doing this after a long school day. The parent is asking for something that's logistically difficult\u2014student from another school, different dismissal time. The teacher is willing to adjust their schedule but wants to be compensated because they're already giving up time and energy.\n\nThe parent's reaction seems extreme. They accused the teacher of not caring and being in it for money, which is a harsh judgment. The teacher's main job is with their own students, and they're not obligated to help another school's child. Also, tutors in the area charge $30/hour, so $25 seems reasonable. The teacher isn't overcharging; they're even giving a discount.\n\nThe teacher isn't in the wrong here. They're setting boundaries and seeking fair compensation for their time. The parent's outburst is inappropriate, but the teacher's actions are justified. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
