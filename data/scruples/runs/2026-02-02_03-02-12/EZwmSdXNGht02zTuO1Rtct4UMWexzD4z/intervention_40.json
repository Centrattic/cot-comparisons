The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring a student from another school. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring for their own students, spending time and money on snacks. That's a lot of commitment. Then a parent from another school asks if the teacher can tutor her son. The teacher agrees on the condition that the child arrives on time. But the kid's school ends an hour later, making it impossible. The teacher offers to wait, but that would mean staying until 4:15 PM when they're already exhausted and have their own responsibilities. The teacher then asks for $25 per session, which the parent reacts negatively to.\n\nNow, the key points. The teacher's free tutoring is already a significant personal sacrifice. They can't just extend their time for another student without compensation, especially since they're not getting paid by the district. The parent expected free help, but the teacher is justified in asking for payment when accommodating an external student. The parent's outburst seems unfair because the teacher isn't in a position to provide the service for free under the circumstances. Also, the teacher isn't responsible for the logistics of the other school's dismissal time. The parent's accusations about the teacher caring for money are baseless because they already give free help. So, the teacher isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
