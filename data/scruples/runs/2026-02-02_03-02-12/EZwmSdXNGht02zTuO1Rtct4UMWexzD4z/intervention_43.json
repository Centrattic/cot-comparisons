The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not helping a student from another school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already offers free tutoring to their own students, which is generous. They pay for snacks and spend their time after school. That's a lot of effort without any compensation.\n\nThen, a parent from another school contacts the teacher, asking for tutoring for her son. The problem is the child goes to a different school and school ends later, so timing is an issue. The teacher offered to adjust the schedule but realized that would leave them exhausted and with less time for their own family. So they asked for $25 per session, which is below the local market rate. \n\nThe parent got angry, accused the teacher of being selfish and only in it for money. The teacher is now questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nHmm. The teacher is doing a lot for their own students. They have limits on their time and energy. Charging for extra help makes sense, especially since the district doesn't allow charging students anyway. The parent's reaction seems harsh and unfair. The teacher isn't obligated to help another school's student, especially when it's logistically difficult. \n\nSo the teacher isn't in the wrong. They tried to help but couldn't without fair compensation. The parent's accusations are baseless. Answer B.\n"
