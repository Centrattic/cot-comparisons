The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring sessions after school for their own students. They provide snacks, pay for them out of pocket, and do this without getting paid. Then a parent from another school asks if they can tutor their son too. The problem is that the boy goes to a different school that ends later, so timing is an issue. The teacher offers to wait if the parent can get the kid there by 4:15, which they can't. The teacher then offers to tutor the boy separately but asks for $25 per session, which is below the local rate of $30. The parent gets angry, calling the teacher names and accusing them of not caring about kids.\n\nFirst, the teacher is already doing a lot for free. They're in a rural area with low-income families, and they're volunteering their time. The parent is asking for a favor that's outside the original arrangement. The teacher can't adjust their schedule because they have other commitments, like helping their own son with homework. The teacher is within their rights to ask for compensation for their time, especially since they're not being paid for this extra work. The parent's reaction is hostile and unreasonable. The teacher isn't obligated to help the other student, so refusing isn't the wrong. The parent's anger seems misplaced because they expected free help without considering the teacher's constraints and the value of their time. So, the teacher isn't the asshole here.\n"
