The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the teacher is in the wrong for not tutoring a student from another school. \n\nFirst, the teacher already provides free tutoring for her own students in a low-income area. She uses her own time and money for snacks. That's pretty generous. Now, a parent from another school asks for help for her son. The problem is the timing: the student's school ends later, so he can't make the existing sessions. The teacher offers to tutor him separately but asks for $25 per session. The parent gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of being selfish.\n\nSo, the key points here: the teacher is offering her time beyond her already existing commitments. She's not required to tutor other school's students. The parent expected free help, maybe not considering the teacher's time and personal life. The teacher is already stretched thin, helping her own students for free, and now has to drive home, help her own son with homework. Charging $25 might seem low given the going rate of $30, but she's not charging the market rate. The parent's reaction seems harsh because the teacher is trying to balance her own responsibilities. \n\nIs the teacher in the wrong? Probably not. She's within her rights to set boundaries. She's already doing a lot for her own students. The parent's expectations were unreasonable, expecting free tutoring for a student outside her school and district. The teacher wasn't obligated to help, and charging a reasonable fee for her time is fair, especially given the time and energy constraints. The parent's outburst is the real issue here. So, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
