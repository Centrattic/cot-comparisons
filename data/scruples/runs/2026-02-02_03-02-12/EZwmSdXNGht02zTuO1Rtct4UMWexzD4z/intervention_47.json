The average household is right at or below the poverty line; the only exceptions are the professionals in our community.  \n\nEvery year I offer to tutor my students who are below level in reading and/or math.  I do this free of charge (in my district, charging money for tutoring your own students is a conflict of interest.).  The tutoring sessions last forty five minutes and start immediately after school.  School lets out at 2:40, we start our lesson @ 2:50.  I provide a snack for the students since lunch time was at 11:00 and kids don\u2019t focus well when they are hungry.  I pay for the snacks myself.  \n\nAnyway, I had a parent from another school contact me out of the blue.  I was tutoring her best friend\u2019s daughter (one of my kiddos, remember) and she wanted to know if I\u2019d also tutor her son.  She told me his reading level, which was abysmal, and I have a really hard time saying no to a child in need.  I told her the tutoring times and said that if she could get the child there in time I would help.  \n\nTurns out, the child attends school in a different county approximately an hour\u2019s drive away.  The school also dismisses thirty minutes later than we do.  Obviously Mom can\u2019t get the student to me in time.  So she asks if I would wait and tutor her son separately.\n\nThis means the child would arrive around 4:15.  I get to work at 6:30 and by 4:15 I am simply out of energy.  Besides, I have to help my own son with his school work and that\u2019s always a hassle.  It takes me 40 minutes to drive home, which would mean I\u2019d get home about 5:45, depending on traffic.  \n\nThe going rate for reading tutors in this area is $30 bucks per hour.  I wanted compensation for my time, so I told her the cost would be $25 per session.  \n\nShe completely flipped out.  Called me all sorts of horrible names and made some very uncouth remarks about my teaching ability.  The one that hurt the most was that I didn\u2019t care about the kids, I\u2019m just in it for the money, etc.  She told me I was a disgrace to teaching and incredibly selfish, and that this kind of shit was why everyone hates public school teachers.\n\nHer words are constantly replaying in my head.  I don\u2019t think I am an asshole for asking for compensation, but am I the asshole for not tutoring her student?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The teacher is offering free tutoring for her own students because the district doesn't allow charging. She provides snacks and spends her own time doing this. Then a parent from another school asks for the same, but the kid is in a different county and can't come at the same time. The parent wants the teacher to adjust her schedule, which would mean the teacher has to stay later.\n\nThe teacher is already exhausted by 4:15 PM and has other responsibilities like helping her own son. She offers to tutor for $25, which is $30 an hour, but the parent gets angry and says mean things. The teacher is asking if she's wrong for not continuing the free tutoring for this other student.\n\nFirst, the teacher isn't obligated to tutor outside of her job. She's already giving up her time and resources for her own students. The parent's child isn't her student, so there's no professional obligation here. The parent approached her out of the blue, expecting the same free service without considering the teacher's availability or compensation. The teacher is in a low-economic area, so charging $25 isn't unreasonable compared to the going rate. The parent's reaction seems harsh and unfair, accusing her of caring only for money, which is a mischaracterization since she's already volunteering for her own students.\n\nSo, the teacher isn't in the wrong. She set boundaries, tried to accommodate by offering paid sessions, and the parent overreacted. The answer should be B.\n"
