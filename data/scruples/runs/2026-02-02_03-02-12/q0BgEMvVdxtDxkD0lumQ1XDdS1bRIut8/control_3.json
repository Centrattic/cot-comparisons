I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is pretty detailed. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author is 23, part of r/childfree, and really hates kids. They smoke marijuana often, work from home, and have a side business with car repairs. Their house isn't baby-proofed. The brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids because their sister couldn't. The author refused because they can't take time off work, the house isn't safe, and they were saving PTO for a trip. The brother and wife got angry, called the author names, and posted on Facebook.\n\nFirst, the author has a right to their own time and space. They mentioned they can't spare a week, which is a lot. Also, their house isn't kid-safe, which is a valid concern. The last-minute request makes it even harder. Plus, the author isn't being paid, so expecting them to use PTO for someone else's kids when they have their own plans seems unfair. The brother's reaction is pretty harsh too, especially since they knew the author didn't like kids. The author's refusal seems reasonable given their personal circumstances and the suddenness of the request. They also have a valid point about the house not being safe and the need to maintain their work schedule. The brother should have planned ahead or found another solution. The author isn't obligated to help, especially with so little notice and the added stress of their environment not being suitable. So, the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
