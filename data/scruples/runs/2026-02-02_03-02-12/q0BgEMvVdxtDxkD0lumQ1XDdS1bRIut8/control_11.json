I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and openly hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have a job that allows working from home, including using marijuana. They also have a side business working on cars.\n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, originally leaving the kids with their sister. But the sister had to leave for a family emergency. Two days before the trip, the brother asks the author to babysit. The author refuses because they can't take time off work (using PTO for a planned trip), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't stop using marijuana. The brother and sister-in-law get angry, call the author names, and rant on Facebook. The sister also thinks the author should have agreed.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The author has made their dislike of kids clear. They have valid reasons for refusal\u2014work commitments, lack of a safe environment, and personal habits that conflict with childcare. The brother waited until last minute and didn't plan ahead. The author wasn't given enough time to make their house safe or adjust their schedule. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them derogatory names and using their drug use as an insult.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness standpoint, the author isn't obligated to babysit, especially since they've made their stance on kids clear. The brother didn't plan ahead and now is placing a last-minute burden on someone who isn't equipped or willing. The author's reasons are legitimate. The brother's anger and public shaming might be the real issue here. The sister's expectation also seems misplaced if the author's limitations are known.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family obligations come into play. But the author has a right to their own life and boundaries, especially when it's a last-minute request that conflicts with their work and personal life. The brother's cruise was planned for five years, but not having a backup plan for childcare is on them. The author's refusal isn't the problem; the brother's reaction is. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
