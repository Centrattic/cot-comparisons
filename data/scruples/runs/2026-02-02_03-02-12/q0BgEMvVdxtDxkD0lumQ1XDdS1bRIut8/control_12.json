I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 23, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they have a job that allows marijuana use. They also have repair appointments scheduled. The brother asked them to babysit two days before a cruise that they've planned for five years. The author said no because they can't take time off (using PTO for a guys' trip), can't make their house safe for kids, and can't cancel appointments. The brother and his wife then yelled, called them names, and posted on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have watched them despite the challenges.\n\nSo, the main points here are the author's personal dislike of children, their inability to accommodate due to work and living situation, and the brother's last-minute request without considering these factors. The brother's side is upset because they had the trip planned for a long time and couldn't use their sister due to an emergency. They might feel the author is being selfish, but the author's reasons are valid.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and family obligations. In some cases, family is expected to help, especially with childcare. However, the author has legitimate constraints: work, personal preferences, and the house not being safe. The brother gave them no notice, which is a problem. Also, the author isn't being paid, which might add to the burden. \n\nThe brother's reaction\u2014yelling for an hour, making unreasonable demands like throwing out their marijuana and babyproofing in two days\u2014seems excessive. The author's refusal is based on practicality, not just dislike. The sister's opinion might not matter if the situation is impractical. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether their refusal is seen as selfish or if their constraints are valid. Since they have a job, a side business, and a house not suited for kids, plus they hate children, their reasons are strong. The brother should have planned earlier and considered the author's limitations. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
