I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. I need to analyze the details given.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the youngest of three siblings, and part of r/childfree. They hate children, which the family knows. They smoke marijuana often, their house isn't babyproofed, and they work from home with a side business in car repairs. The brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, but the author couldn't because they have repair appointments, the house isn't safe, and they were saving PTO for their own trip. The brother and sister-in-law yelled at them, called them names, and posted on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have helped, but the author argues it's not feasible.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole? Let's break it down. The author's reasons: they dislike kids, their environment isn't safe, they have work commitments, and they were planning to use PTO for their own trip. The brother's side: they had a long-planned trip and needed childcare. The key points here are the timing of the request (last minute) and the author's inability to meet the demands (safety, work, PTO). \n\nThe author didn't know about the sister's emergency until the request was made, and the brother didn't plan ahead. The author's refusal is based on legitimate constraints. The family's reaction might be excessive, but the author's stance is understandable given their situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they provided valid reasons and the brother's request was last-minute and unrealistic. The author isn't obligated to make such a large sacrifice, especially with their known stance on children and work commitments.\n"
