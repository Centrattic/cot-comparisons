I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author declining to babysit their brother's kids, even though the brother and sister-in-law had planned a cruise for five years and asked two days before the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, and lives in a state where marijuana is legal for both medical and recreational use. They work from home but have a side business working on cars. They smoke frequently, their house isn't babyproofed, and they can't take a week off work because they were saving PTO for a guys' trip. Also, they have repair appointments scheduled. The brother asked last-minute, and the author couldn't meet the sudden demands of removing all marijuana, babyproofing, and taking the time off. The brother and sister-in-law responded angrily, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister is also pressuring them, but the author claims it's not feasible without giving up their own plans and making significant sacrifices.\n\nSo, the main question is whether refusing is the asshole move here. Let's consider the factors. The author has a known dislike for children and a lifestyle that includes marijuana use, which the family might not be comfortable with. They were given only two days' notice, which is really short for such a responsibility. They also have work commitments that can't be easily moved, like repair appointments and needing to use PTO for their own trip. The parents aren't offering to pay them, which could be a point\u2014if it's a favor, maybe they should do it, but the author is making a personal sacrifice. \n\nOn the other hand, family emergencies can come up, and maybe the parents expected a family member to step in. The author's house isn't safe for kids, and they can't stop working, so their refusal is based on practical reasons. The parents' reaction seems harsh, especially calling them a drug addict and sharing it on Facebook. The sister's opinion is divided here; she thinks the author should help, but maybe she's not considering the full context.\n\nI need to think about common AITA standards. Usually, people are expected to help family in emergencies, but here the parents had their own plans and only asked last minute. The author's responsibilities and personal boundaries might be valid. The fact that they have a side business and scheduled work could mean their jobs are non-negotiable, especially if they're self-employed. Also, their dislike for kids isn't their fault, and it's reasonable to not want to care for them if it's a significant stressor.\n\nThe parents might have a point in expecting family support, but the timing and the demands (like getting rid of their marijuana and babyproofing in two days) are unreasonable. The author's refusal is based on legitimate constraints, not just personal preference. The parents' harsh judgment and public shaming could be seen as the real asshole behavior here. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
