I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me start by going through the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author is 23 years old, part of an online community that's child-free, and openly hates children. Their family is aware of this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, both medically and recreationally. The author uses marijuana frequently, has a home that's not baby-proofed, and works from home with a job that allows marijuana use. They also have a side business working on cars. They don't go out much and have a busy workload.\n\nThe brother planned a week-long cruise for their anniversary, initially planning to leave the kids with their sister. However, the sister had to leave due to a family emergency. Two days before the trip, the brother asked the author to babysit. The author declined, citing that they can't take time off work (using PTO they were saving for a trip), their house isn't safe for kids, and they have repair appointments scheduled. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author a \"drug addict\" and a \"useless asshole,\" and posted about it on Facebook. The sister sides with them, but the author argues that their request is unrealistic given their circumstances.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author has a known dislike for children, their living situation isn't suitable for kids, they have prior commitments, and the request came last-minute. The parents expected the author to accommodate them without considering these factors. The author also isn't being compensated, which adds to their burden.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. From a general standpoint, family obligations can be complex. However, the author had already communicated their stance on children and their lifestyle choices. The brother made a last-minute request without giving the author time to prepare or adjust their schedule. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons\u2014work commitments, personal preferences, and safety concerns. The parents' reaction seems harsh, especially since they didn't give adequate notice and are projecting their expectations onto the author.\n\nIn many cases, families might expect some support, but it's also reasonable to have boundaries. The author isn't obligated to babysit, especially given the circumstances. The fact that the parents are using public shaming (Facebook rants) and calling the author derogatory names suggests their response is excessive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. Their refusal is justified by their personal situation and the lack of prior planning from the brother's side.\n"
