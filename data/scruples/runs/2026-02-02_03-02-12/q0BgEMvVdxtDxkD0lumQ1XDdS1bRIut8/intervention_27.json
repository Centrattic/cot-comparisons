I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is 23, a member of r/childfree, and really hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, both medicinally and recreationally, and they use it often. Their job allows remote work, and they have a side business working on cars. The brother and sister-in-law are going on a cruise for their anniversary but had to back out of leaving the kids with their sister because of a medical emergency on the sister's husband's side. So they turned to the author two days before the trip to ask if they can babysit. The author says no, gives reasons like not having time, needing PTO for their own trip, the house not being kid-safe, and already having repair appointments scheduled. The brother and sister got angry, called the author a drug addict and useless, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister is upset too, but the author argues that the brother's request is unrealistic.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons for refusing: they hate kids, their house isn't safe, they have a workload they can't reschedule, and they need to use PTO days for a planned trip. The brother asked last minute, only two days before the cruise. The author is in a position where they can't just drop everything because they have existing commitments. Also, the brother's family knew the author's stance on kids and their marijuana use, so they should have anticipated that this might not be a viable option. \n\nThe brother's side: they had a planned trip for five years and felt wronged by the author's refusal. But they approached the author at the last minute without considering the author's situation. The author's refusal is based on practical issues (work, house safety) and personal feelings (dislike of children), which are valid. The brother's reaction of yelling and calling the author derogatory names seems harsh, especially since they should have known the author's position. \n\nThe sister's reaction is unclear, but she might be caught in the middle. The author's argument is that the request is unreasonable because the brother didn't plan ahead, and the author can't make the necessary adjustments (like baby-proofing) in two days. The brother is also asking the author to give up their PTO and potentially lose income, even though they aren't paying for the babysitting. That seems like an unfair expectation. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're being asked to make a significant sacrifice without prior notice or compensation. Their reasons for refusal are practical and personal, and they communicated that the request was unrealistic. The brother's response, especially the Facebook ranting, is likely the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The brother and sister-in-law should have considered the author's known limitations and given more notice. The author's refusal is justified by their commitments and inability to meet the request. The answer should be B (No).\n"
