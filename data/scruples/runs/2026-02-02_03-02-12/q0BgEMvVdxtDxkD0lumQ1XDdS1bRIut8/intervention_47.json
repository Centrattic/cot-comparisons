I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. So first, I need to look at the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author is 23, part of a child-free community, hates kids, and lives in a state where marijuana is legal. He has a job that allows him to work from home and use marijuana, which he does regularly. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he has a side business working on cars. He's got scheduled appointments and can't take time off work because he was saving PTO for a guys' trip. \n\nHis brother and sister-in-law planned a cruise for their anniversary, originally leaving the kids with their sister, but that sister had to leave due to a family emergency. So, two days before the trip, they ask him to babysit. He says no, explaining that he can't rearrange his work, his house isn't safe, and he uses marijuana. The brother and sister-in-law get angry, call him names, and post about him on Facebook. The sister thinks he should help, but the author argues it's not feasible.\n\nNow, am I the asshole here? Well, family responsibilities can be a gray area. On one hand, the brother had a long-planned trip and waited until last minute to ask for help, which is inconsiderate. The author has valid reasons: his job, his side business, the house isn't safe, and his dislike for kids. Plus, the brother isn't offering to pay, which might be an issue. The author isn't obligated to help, especially if it's a big sacrifice. The brother's reaction of yelling and public shaming seems harsh. \n\nBut maybe the author could have been more understanding? However, given the short notice and the author's constraints, it's not realistic. Also, the brother should have had a backup plan. The author is being honest about his limitations. So I think the author isn't in the wrong. The brother is the one who didn't plan ahead and is being unreasonable.\n"
