I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 23-year-old man who's part of the childfree community and really hates kids, refuses to babysit his brother's kids for a week. His brother had planned a cruise for their anniversary, but two days before the trip, their sister couldn't take the kids because her husband's family had a medical emergency. The brother then asks the author to take the kids, but he says no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions he's not a fan of kids, his house isn't babyproofed, he uses marijuana (which is legal in his state), and he's got a workload and appointments. He works from home but can't move his setup. He was saving PTO for his own trip. The brother and wife were upset, called him a drug addict and an asshole, and even posted about him on Facebook. The sister is pressuring him.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's got valid reasons: he isn't comfortable with kids, his home isn't safe for them, he's already busy with work, and he's not getting paid. Also, the request came last-minute, which complicates things. His brother's frustration is understandable because they've been planning this trip for five years, but the timing was really bad. However, the author isn't obligated to help if he's not in a position to do so. \n\nOn the other hand, family situations can be tricky. The brother might expect some support, especially for something significant like an anniversary cruise. But the author has his own commitments and personal boundaries. The brother's response of yelling, name-calling, and public shaming seems excessive. \n\nI think the key points are the author's right to set boundaries and the unrealistic expectations from the brother. The author isn't avoiding responsibility without cause. His reasons are legitimate, and the brother's reaction is what's problematic. The sister's stance might be typical family pressure, but it doesn't make the author wrong. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
