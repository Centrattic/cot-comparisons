I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a 23-year-old who openly hates children and is part of a child-free community. Their family is aware of this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use, and they work from home, which allows them to use marijuana. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have a side business working on cars. They have scheduled repair appointments that can't be canceled.\n\nThe brother asked two days before the cruise, which was planned for five years. The original plan was for the sister to babysit, but she couldn't due to a family emergency. The brother wants the author to take the kids for a week. The author can't do it because they need to work, can't use PTO for this, and their house isn't safe. Plus, they can't stop using marijuana because the brother's kids wouldn't be allowed to be around that.\n\nThe brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted on Facebook. The sister is pressuring the author as well. The author argues that the request is unrealistic and unreasonable, especially since the brother is asking for a last-minute change and the author's house is unsafe.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author has valid reasons: personal dislike of children, work commitments, house safety, and the last-minute nature of the request. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially given the author's limitations. The author isn't obligated to help if it's not feasible for them. The key here is that the request was made at the last minute and the author has legitimate constraints. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
