I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brothers' kids. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is 23 years old, part of the childfree community, and has a strong dislike for children. Their family is aware of this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it regularly. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they work from home with a side business involving car repairs. They can't take a week off work because they need their PTO for a planned guys' trip. \n\nThe brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids because their usual caregiver (their sister) had to leave due to a family emergency. The author refused because they couldn't rearrange their work, the house isn't safe, and they can't give up their PTO. The brother and his wife reacted angrily, called the author names, and posted about them on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should help, but the author argues that the sacrifice required is too much compared to the cruise's cost.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider several factors. The main issue is family obligation versus personal boundaries. The author has made it clear they dislike children and their living situation isn't suitable. They also have valid work commitments. The brother's request came last minute, which adds to the difficulty. \n\nThe brother and sister might feel the author should prioritize family, but the author isn't obligated to do so. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their personal life and work. The fact that the author was planning to use PTO for their own trip is a personal choice, and the brother's cruise cost isn't a valid reason to expect others to cover expenses. \n\nThe brother's reaction (yelling, calling names, Facebook rant) seems excessive. The author isn't at fault for refusing a request that's impractical given their circumstances. The key points are the last-minute notice, the unsuitability of the house, the author's work commitments, and their personal dislike for children. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They had legitimate reasons to decline, and the brother's family overreacted. The answer should be B.\n"
