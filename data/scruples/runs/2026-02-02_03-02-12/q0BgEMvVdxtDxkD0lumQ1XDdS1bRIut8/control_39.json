I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to babysit their niece and nephew. The person is 23, part of r/childfree, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. Their brother planned a cruise for five years and asked them to babysit two days before the trip. The author refused because they can't take time off work, their house isn't safe for kids, and they don't want to give up their PTO for a guys' trip. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister is now pressuring them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors.\n\nThe author's reasons: They hate kids, their house isn't safe, they have work commitments (repair appointments and working from home), and they were saving PTO for another trip. The brother asked last-minute, which is two days before the cruise. The author wasn't expecting this request, and the timing is tight. Also, the brother's wife wants no marijuana in the house, which the author can't comply with. \n\nThe brother's side: They had the trip planned for five years, and now their sister (who was supposed to watch the kids) had to leave due to a family emergency. They need someone quickly. But they asked the author two days before the trip, giving very little notice. The author's refusal is based on valid reasons\u2014work, personal preferences, and safety. \n\nIs it fair to expect the author to rearrange their schedule and life for a last-minute request? Probably not. The brother and sister-in-law should have planned ahead, considering that their original caregiver (the sister) had an emergency. They might have options like paid childcare or other family members. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but because of genuine constraints. \n\nAlso, the author's dislike of kids is a personal choice, and while they are part of the family, they aren't obligated to babysit, especially when it's a last-minute ask. The brother's reaction of yelling and calling them names seems excessive. The author is not in the wrong here because they communicated their reasons clearly and the request was unreasonable given the circumstances.\n"
