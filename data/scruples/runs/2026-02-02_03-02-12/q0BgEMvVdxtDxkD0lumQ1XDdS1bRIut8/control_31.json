I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author refusing to babysit their brother's kids for a week-long cruise. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 23, part of r/childfree, and hates children. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, both medicinally and recreationally. They work from home, have a side business with car repairs, and use medical marijuana frequently. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they can't spare a week because of work commitments and a planned trip.\n\nThe brother asked two days before the cruise, and the author said no. The brother and wife were upset, called the author names, and criticized their house and marijuana use. The author mentioned they can't move their work setup, can't cancel appointments, and the house isn't safe for kids. They also point out that the brother's request would require more sacrifice than the $900 cruise cost.\n\nSo, the main factors here: the author's right to say no, the timing of the request, the author's personal circumstances (hatred of kids, work, house not safe, medical marijuana use), and the brother's expectations.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The brother asked last minute, which is inconsiderate. The author has valid reasons for refusing: personal dislike, unsuitable living conditions, work obligations. The brother's reaction (yelling, calling names, ranting on Facebook) seems harsh, especially if the author's reasons are legitimate. The sister's opinion might not matter if the author's constraints are real. The question is whether the author was obligated to help despite their personal boundaries. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, people can choose to help family, but they aren't obligated. The brother's expectations might be unreasonable given the short notice and the author's personal situation. The author isn't in the wrong for not meeting unreasonable demands, especially when their position is clear and justified. The brother's reaction is more in the wrong. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
