I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break this down. The author is part of the r/childfree community, which suggests they don't want kids in their life. They hate children, and their family knows that. They live in a state where medical and recreational marijuana is legal, and they work from home but also run a side business working on cars. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they have a lot of work commitments.\n\nThe situation is that the brother had planned a cruise with his wife for their anniversary, but two days before, they couldn't leave the kids with their sister because the sister had to go out of town for a medical emergency. So they ask the author to babysit. The author says no because they can't take time off work (they have PTO saved for a trip), the house isn't safe for kids, and they can't stop smoking marijuana since they use it for work and it's legal. The brother and sister-in-law then yell at them, call them derogatory names, and post about it on Facebook. The author's sister is pressuring them too, but the author argues that it's not feasible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a legitimate reason for refusing: their house isn't safe, they have work obligations, and they hate kids. The brother asked last-minute, only two days before the trip, which is short notice. The author also mentions that the financial sacrifice isn't worth it compared to the cruise cost. \n\nThen, the brother's reaction seems harsh. Yelling for an hour and using insults might be overreacting. The author isn't obligated to help, especially since they explicitly stated their dislike for children and their living situation. The request is unreasonable given the time frame and the author's personal circumstances. Also, the fact that the author's job allows marijuana use but the brother's request would require them to stop using it in their home, which is a personal choice within legal bounds, adds another layer.\n\nThe sister's expectation that the author should watch the kids without considering the feasibility is another point. The author isn't the one who originally had the plan to leave the kids with the sister, so when that falls through, it's not their responsibility to step in unless they volunteered, which the author didn't. \n\nIn terms of morality, while it's common to help family, the author's reasons are valid. They can't put their kids in an unsafe environment, can't rearrange their work, and have a strong aversion to children. The brother's reaction of calling them a \"drug addicted asshole\" is not justifiable either. The author isn't in the wrong here because they made clear their reasons and the request was too demanding given the short notice and their personal limitations.\n"
