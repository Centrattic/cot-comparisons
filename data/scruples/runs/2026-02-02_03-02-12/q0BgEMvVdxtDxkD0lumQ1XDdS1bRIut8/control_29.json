I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The author is 23, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and works from home. They have a side business working on cars and weren't expecting to take care of kids. The brother asked two days before a cruise, which they had planned for five years. The author says no because of work commitments and the house not being kid-safe. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called the author names, and the sister is now taking their side.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: they genuinely dislike kids, which they mentioned upfront. Their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't move their work setup. Also, they were saving PTO for a planned trip. The brother asked last-minute, which is a big ask, especially given the notice period. The author isn't being paid, which might be a factor since they're expected to take time off work for free. The brother's reaction seems harsh, yelling for an hour and calling the author names. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's trip is a big deal, planned for years. But the author has valid reasons for not being able to help. The key points here are the timing of the request, the author's personal circumstances (work, house safety, drug use), and the brother's response. The author isn't obligated to help, especially when it's a significant personal sacrifice. The brother should have planned ahead or considered alternative arrangements. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
