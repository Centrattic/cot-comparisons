I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, from the r/childfree subreddit, and openly states they hate children. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they have work commitments, including a side job working on cars. They were asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, but they said no because they couldn't take time off work (using PTO they had saved for a trip), and their house isn't safe for kids. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks they should have helped.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the factors. The author has a known dislike of children, which the family is aware of. The request came very last minute\u2014only two days before the trip. The author has legitimate commitments (work, their own planned trip, not being able to move their work setup) and their house isn't safe for kids. They also mention not being paid, which might be a factor. The parents are upset because they had the trip planned for five years, but the author's refusal is based on their inability to meet the request realistically.\n\nOn one hand, family obligations can be expected, especially for emergencies or long-planned events. But on the other hand, the author has valid reasons for not being able to help, including their personal preferences, work, and the impracticality of the situation given the short notice. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them a \"drug addict\" and public shaming. The sister's expectation might be misplaced if the situation isn't feasible.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's refusal seems justified. They can't realistically take on the responsibility, especially with the short notice and their own constraints. The brother's anger and public criticism might be overreacting. Therefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
