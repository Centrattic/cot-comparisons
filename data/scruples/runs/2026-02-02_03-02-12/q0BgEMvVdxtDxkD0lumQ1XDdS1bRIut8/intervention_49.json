I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit his brother's kids. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23 years old, part of r/childfree, and openly hates children. His family knows this. He lives in a state where marijuana is legal, both medically and recreationally. He works from home, has a side business with car repairs, and uses PTO days for his own planned trips. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he can't move his work setup.\n\nThe brother asked two days before a cruise for him to babysit for a week. The author refused because he can't take time off work without using PTO, his house isn't safe for kids, and he can't quit using marijuana. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called him names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks he should have agreed.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author has a valid reason to refuse\u2014his lifestyle, work commitments, and living situation don't allow for childcare. The brother waited until last minute, expecting the author to drop everything. The author's refusal is based on personal boundaries and practical constraints. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially given the short notice and the author's clear inability to accommodate. There's no mention of prior childcare responsibilities or expectations. The author isn't obligated to help, especially since it's a last-minute request conflicting with his own plans and work. The fact that the brother planned the trip for five years doesn't negate the author's right to say no, especially when the request is unrealistic. The author's stance is about not sacrificing his own time and resources for a situation that's not feasible. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
