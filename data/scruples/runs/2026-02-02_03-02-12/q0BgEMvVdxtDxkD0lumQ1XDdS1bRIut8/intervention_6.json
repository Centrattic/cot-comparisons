I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23 years old, part of the childfree community, and openly hates children. His family knows this. He lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and he uses it regularly. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he has a side business working on cars. He works from home and uses PTO for personal time.\n\nHis brother wanted to leave his kids with the author for a week-long cruise on their anniversary. The original plan was for their sister to take the kids, but she couldn't because of a family emergency. They asked the author two days before the trip. He said no because he can't take time off work, especially since he was saving PTO for a guy's trip. Also, his house isn't safe for kids, and he can't move his work setup. His brother and sister-in-law were upset, called him names, and he felt their demands were unrealistic.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the author is being honest about his feelings towards kids and his current situation. He's not obligated to care for his nephew and niece, especially since he doesn't like children. The brother's request came last-minute, and the author has valid reasons for refusal: work commitments, house not safe, and not being paid. The brother's reaction seems harsh, and using Facebook to rant isn't helpful. The sister's opinion might be biased given the family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother expected family support. But the author isn't a parent and has made his stance clear. The brother should have planned ahead and considered backup options. The author isn't avoiding responsibility; he's being upfront. The brother's demands (throwing out marijuana, making the house safe in two days) are extreme. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. He's being honest and realistic. The brother should have better planning and understanding of the author's situation.\n"
