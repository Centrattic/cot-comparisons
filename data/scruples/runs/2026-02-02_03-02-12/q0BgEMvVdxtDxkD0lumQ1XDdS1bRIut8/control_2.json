I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old man refusing to babysit his brother's kids. He's part of the childfree community and really hates kids, which his family knows. He lives in a place where marijuana is legal, and he smokes often. His house isn't babyproofed, and he can't take time off work because he's saving PTO for a trip. His brother asked last-minute to watch the kids, two days before the cruise, and he said no. The brother and his wife got angry, called him names, and the sister thinks he should have done it. The question is whether he's an asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The key points here are: the person's dislike of children, the last-minute request, the lack of a safe environment, and the work commitment. Let's break it down.\n\nHe's open about hating kids, so the family knows. The brother asked two days before the trip, which is very short notice. The person can't rearrange his work because he's saving PTO. Also, his house isn't safe for kids, and he uses marijuana, which the brother wants to avoid. The brother's argument is that they're family and the trip was planned for five years. However, the person is making a valid point about the impracticality of the request given his circumstances.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, family members might expect help, but there are limits. Last-minute requests can be unreasonable, especially if they require significant personal sacrifice. The person isn't obligated to take on childcare, especially when it conflicts with his own plans and he's not being compensated. The brother's reaction (calling him a drug addict, yelling) seems excessive. The sister's opinion might be biased, but the main issue is whether the refusal is justified.\n\nConsidering all this, the person's refusal is based on legitimate reasons: personal dislike, safety, work commitments, and the short notice. The brother's demand is unreasonable given those factors. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
