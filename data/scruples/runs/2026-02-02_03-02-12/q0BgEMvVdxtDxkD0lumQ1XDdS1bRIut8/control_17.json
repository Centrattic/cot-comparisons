I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is that the brother asked two days before a cruise, which was planned for five years. The author is 23, in a childfree community, hates children, doesn't have a safe house, and works from home with a side business. They mention using marijuana and that the job allows it, but the brother's request would require them to stop using it during the week and rearrange their work setup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has already communicated their dislike for kids and the fact that their house isn't baby-proof. The brother and sister-in-law made the request very late, two days before the trip. They wanted the author to give up their PTO for a guys' trip, throw out a significant amount of marijuana, and make their house safe in a short time. The author refused because it's not feasible. The brother then called them names and posted on Facebook.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. The important factors here are the timeline of the request, the author's personal boundaries, the lack of safety in their home, and the fact that their job is okay with marijuana use. The brother's reaction is also a point\u2014yelling, name-calling, public shaming. \n\nIn terms of responsibilities, family can sometimes expect help, but there's a limit. The author isn't a parent, so they aren't obligated to babysit. Also, the request came at the last minute, making it hard to accommodate. The author's job and side business depend on their current setup, which can't be moved. Plus, the marijuana use is legal in their state, and the brother would expect them to stop using it, which is a personal choice. \n\nThe author's sister thinks they should watch the kids, but the situation doesn't seem to have viable options. The author's refusal isn't selfish if it's based on real constraints and prior commitments. The brother's response, however, seems harsh and unreasonable, especially given the short notice and the author's justified reasons. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on their living situation, work, and personal preferences. The brother's reaction is more about their own frustration than the author's wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
