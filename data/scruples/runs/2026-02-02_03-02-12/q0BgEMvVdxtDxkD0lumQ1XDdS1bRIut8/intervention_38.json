I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is detailed in the provided text.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it regularly. They have a home setup that's not babyproofed and a workload that's hard to adjust. The brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, which the author refused. The brother was upset, called the author names, and they fought. The author argues that the request was unrealistic and unreasonable given their circumstances.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, family obligations often come with expectations, especially when it's a significant event like an anniversary cruise. The brother might feel that as part of the family, the author should help out, even if it's last-minute. However, the author has valid reasons: they hate kids, their home isn't safe, they can't take time off work (using PTO for a planned trip), and the request came too late to make accommodations.\n\nThe brother's reaction seems harsh, yelling for an hour and calling the author derogatory terms. That's not a healthy response, but does that reflect on the author's right to say no? Maybe not. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice their time and comfort for a last-minute request, especially considering their personal boundaries and the impracticality of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that their sister was supposed to take the kids but couldn't. The parents might be at fault for not planning backup earlier. The author's refusal isn't out of malice but practicality. The fact that they had a planned trip themselves adds to their justification, as it's unfair to expect someone else to cover without notice when they have their own commitments.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is standing up for their personal space and responsibilities. The brother's anger seems more about their own inconvenience than the author's rights. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
