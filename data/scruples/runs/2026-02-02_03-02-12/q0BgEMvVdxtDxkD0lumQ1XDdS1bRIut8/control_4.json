I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and openly says they hate kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it regularly. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they work from home with a side job fixing cars. They have scheduled repair appointments and were saving PTO for a guys' trip in two months.\n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, originally leaving the kids with their sister. But the sister had a family emergency and couldn't take them. Two days before the trip, the brother asks the author to babysit. The author refuses, citing work commitments, not being paid, needing to use PTO, and the house not being safe for kids. The brother and sister-in-law get angry, call the author a drug addict, and rant about them on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should help, but the author argues it's unrealistic.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author made their stance on kids clear, so the brother might have known not to ask. The request came last-minute, and the author has valid reasons: work commitments, unpaid work, needing PTO they had saved, the house isn't safe, and their personal dislike of kids. The brother's criticism about the marijuana and house safety seems fair, but the author can't realistically comply in two days. The brother's response (yelling, name-calling, public ranting) might indicate overreaction.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't obligated to help, especially with such short notice and without compensation. The brother's planning issue (leaving it to the last minute and relying on family) might be on them. The author's reasons are practical and personal. Even though family obligations can be expected, the circumstances here seem unreasonable. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
