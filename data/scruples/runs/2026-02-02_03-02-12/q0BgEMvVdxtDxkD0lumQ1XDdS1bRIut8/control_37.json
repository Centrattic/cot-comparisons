I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and openly states they hate children. Their family is aware of this. They also have a marijuana habit and a house that's not babyproofed. They work from home and have scheduled repair jobs.\n\nThe brother asked two days before a cruise for the kids (aged not specified, but referred to as \"crotch goblins\") to be watched. The author declines, citing work commitments, lack of safe environment, and not being paid. The brother then yells at them, calls them names, and they end up in a Facebook rant. The sister is pressuring the author, but the author feels the request is unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the author have a duty to help family? Well, in many cultures, family support is expected, but the author has valid reasons. They can't make the house safe in two days, they're not paid, and it conflicts with their work and personal life. The brother waited until last minute, which is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's stance on not liking kids and the house being unsafe are significant. It's not just about willingness but capability. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them names and public shaming. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice their time and resources for a last-minute request, especially when they have other commitments and the setup isn't feasible.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible decision based on their circumstances. The brother and sister-in-law are at fault for the last-minute ask and poor handling of the situation. The answer should be B.\n"
