I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is pretty detailed. The author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, uses marijuana, and works from home. The brother last-minute asked them to watch the kids for a week, but the author couldn't because of work, the house isn't kid-safe, and they don't want to give up their PTO. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasons. They have a known dislike for children, which the family is aware of. The brother asked two days before the trip, which is super short notice. The author is working from home, has a side business with repair appointments, and the house isn't baby-proof. Plus, they were saving PTO for their own trip. The brother wanted them to throw out their weed and make the house safe in two days, which the author found unrealistic. \n\nOn the other side, the brother's argument is that it's a family obligation, especially since the sister couldn't help due to an emergency. They had the trip planned for five years, which adds to their frustration. However, the author's refusal is based on valid reasons: time constraints, work commitments, and the impracticality of the request. \n\nFamily obligations can be a gray area. But in this case, the brother asked very last minute, and the author's reasons seem legitimate. The author isn't obligated to use their PTO for free, especially when they have their own plans. The fact that the author's house isn't safe for kids is another point in their favor. The brother's reaction of yelling and public shaming might indicate that they overreacted. \n\nThe key points are: short notice, author's personal boundaries (hating kids, using marijuana), work commitments, and the feasibility of the request. The author isn't in a position where they can reasonably accommodate the request without significant sacrifice. The brother should have had a backup plan, especially for a trip planned five years in advance. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had valid reasons and the brother should have considered other options beforehand. The answer is B.\n"
