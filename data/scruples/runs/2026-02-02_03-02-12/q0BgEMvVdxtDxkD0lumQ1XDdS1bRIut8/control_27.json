I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading their situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the youngest of three siblings, and they're part of a community where they express hatred for children. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal both medically and recreationally, and they use it often. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have a lot of work commitments. They mentioned that their job allows marijuana use, and they work from home. Their side business is car repairs, which probably requires them to be present.\n\nThe brother wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary, which they'd planned for five years. Originally, they were going to leave the kids with the sister, but the sister had to leave due to a medical emergency, so she flew out. Two days before the trip, the brother asked the author to babysit. The author said no because they can't take a week off (they were saving PTO for a guys' trip in two months), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't move their work setup. Also, the brother wanted them to get rid of their marijuana and make the house kid-safe quickly.\n\nThe brother and wife got angry, called the author a useless, drug-addicted asshole, and hung up. They also vented on Facebook, and the sister thinks the author should have agreed. The author is asking if they're the asshole for refusing under these circumstances.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I should consider the reasons they refused. They have a valid reason for not wanting to watch kids: they hate children, the house isn't safe, they can't take time off work without sacrificing their own plans, and the request came too late. Also, the brother's demand to remove marijuana and make the house safe in two days is unrealistic. The author isn't obligated to drop everything, especially since it's not their responsibility. The brother and wife overreacted with yelling and public shaming, which is more about their frustration than the author's wrongdoing. The sister's opinion that the author should watch them might be from a different perspective, but the author's situation seems justified. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
