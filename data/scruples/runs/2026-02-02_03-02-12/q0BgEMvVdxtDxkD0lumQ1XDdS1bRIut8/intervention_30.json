I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not babysitting their brothers' kids. The situation is that the brother asked two days before a cruise, and the person says no because they hate kids, their house isn't safe, they can't move their work setup, and they were saving PTO for a trip. The brother and wife got angry, called them a drug addict and an asshole, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person is 23, part of the r/childfree community, and openly dislikes kids. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they work from home, which involves working on cars. They also use marijuana, which is legal in their state. The brother asked last minute, which is two days before the cruise, and the person didn't have the capacity to take the kids. The brother's side is upset, especially because they had planned the cruise for five years. \n\nThe person refused, explaining their reasons. The brother and wife reacted angrily, which included yelling, calling names, and using social media to rant. The sister now thinks the person should have helped, but the situation is that the person can't realistically do it without making a big sacrifice. The person's reasons include not being able to move their work setup, the house not being safe, and the need to use PTO they had saved.\n\nI need to determine if the person is in the wrong. In many cases, people have the right to say no to family requests that they can't fulfill, especially if it's not feasible. The brother's request came at a very short notice, which is two days before the trip. Preparing a house to be child-safe in two days would be challenging, especially if it's not already ready. The person's job and other commitments also make it impossible. Additionally, the person's dislike for kids is a valid personal preference. \n\nHowever, the brother's frustration is understandable since they had a long-planned trip. But the responsibility to provide last-minute childcare isn't something the person is obligated to do, especially given their own constraints. The way the brother and wife reacted, including public shaming and name-calling, seems excessive. The person clearly communicated their reasons, which are valid. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the person isn't in the wrong. They had legitimate reasons to decline and communicated that. The brother's family overreacted. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
