I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author, who is 23 years old and part of the r/childfree community, is an asshole for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The key points here are the brother's request coming two days before the trip, the author's personal dislike of children, the house not being baby-proofed, and the author's other commitments like work and a planned guys' trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations around family responsibilities. The brother asked last minute, which might be a factor. Typically, people plan childcare in advance, so if they only asked two days before, that's not much time to prepare. The author has a valid reason for not being able to accommodate: the house isn't safe for kids. Babysitting requires a secure environment, and if the author's home isn't set up for that, it's a legitimate concern. Also, the author is saving PTO for their own trip, and the brother's cruise is a five-year plan. But the author's refusal isn't just about time; it's about being able to provide a safe space. \n\nThe brother and wife's reaction seems harsh. Calling the author a \"drug addict\" and a \"useless asshole\" is definitely crossing a line. Even if there was some frustration, yelling for an hour and publicly ranting on Facebook isn't appropriate. The author's stance is about the practical impossibility of the request and their personal boundaries. The sister's expectation that they should still watch the kids despite the situation might indicate family pressure, but the author's reasons are clear and reasonable. \n\nSo, the author isn't at fault here. They communicated their inability to take on the responsibility, and the other party's reaction was excessive. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
