I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is presented as an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post. The author is 23, part of the childfree group, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and has a home that isn't babyproof. They were asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, which they declined because they can't take time off work, don't want to give up PTO for a guys' trip, and their house isn't safe. The brother and sister-in-law got upset, called them a drug addict and a useless asshole, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know the assistant's take. I need to decide between A (Yes) and B (No).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author has made it clear they don't like kids and their family knows this. They have a valid reason for not wanting to take on the responsibility: their house isn't safe, they have work obligations, and they have a planned trip using their PTO. The brother asked last-minute, which is two days before the trip. The brother and sister-in-law seem to be placing an unreasonable expectation on the author, especially given the short notice and the author's stated inability.\n\nThe brother had planned the trip for five years, but that doesn't necessarily make their request justified. The author's refusal is based on their own constraints and the fact that their living situation isn't suitable. The brother's reaction\u2014yelling, calling names, and public shaming\u2014seems excessive. The author didn't volunteer, was asked last-minute, and declined politely but firmly. The fact that the author is saving PTO for their own plans also adds to the fairness of the situation. In many cases, people are expected to have their own time and not be forced to rearrange their lives for others, especially when it's not their responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations are important, but the author has made their stance clear about disliking kids and their home not being safe. It's not uncommon for people to have boundaries, especially regarding childcare. The brother's demand to throw out marijuana and babyproof the house in two days is unrealistic. The author's reasons are legitimate, and the brother's response was hostile and unreasonable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their inability in a reasonable way, and the brother's reaction was the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
