I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author refusing to babysit their brother's kids for a cruise. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they hate children and their family knows this. They're 23, live in a state where marijuana is legal, and their house isn't childproof. They also have work commitments and a planned trip that they were saving PTO for. The brother asked two days before the cruise, which seems last-minute. The author says no because they can't rearrange their work, the house isn't safe, and they use marijuana. The brother and his wife reacted angrily, called them names, and complained on Facebook.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider reasons why someone might be blamed. If the author is being selfish or not helping family, that's a point against them. But on the other hand, the request was last-minute, the author has valid reasons (work, house safety, personal preferences), and isn't being paid. The brother's reaction might be excessive too.\n\nThe key points are: the author's clear dislike for kids, the impracticality of the request given their work setup, the last-minute notice, and the brother's harsh response. The author isn't obligated to babysit, especially with those constraints. The brother might have had other options if this was a last resort. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They have legitimate reasons to say no, and the brother's anger seems unwarranted. So the answer is B.\n"
