I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is 23, part of r/childfree, and really dislikes kids. Their family knows this. They have a job that allows working from home and using marijuana, which is legal in their state. They have a side business working on cars. The brother wanted them to babysit for a week while he and his wife go on a cruise, which they planned for five years. The problem is, the author's sister was supposed to take the kids but had a family emergency. The author declined because their house isn't babyproofed, they have work commitments, and they were saving PTO for a trip. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The author's sister now thinks they should have watched the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here: the author has a known aversion to children, the request came last minute (two days before the cruise), the setup of their home isn't suitable, and their work schedule can't accommodate. The brother and sister-in-law are upset because they wanted the kids in a safe, drug-free environment and expected family support. \n\nBut the author's reasons seem valid. They have a legitimate job with scheduled work, a house not ready for kids, and a personal dislike. The brother's demand to throw out weed and babyproof everything in two days is unreasonable. The author isn't obligated to provide childcare, especially when it's a sudden request and they have their own commitments. Family responsibilities don't necessarily mean one has to drop everything, especially when it's not feasible. The brother's reaction of yelling and public shaming might be the real issue here. The author's refusal is based on practical and personal reasons that are hard to overlook. So, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
