I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The author is 23, part of the childfree community, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. Their brother asked two days before a cruise to take care of the kids, but the author can't because their house isn't babyproof, they have work commitments, and they don't want to give up PTO. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and started ranting online.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has made their stance on children clear to the family. They aren't against kids, but they just hate them and can't have them in their home. The brother asked last minute, which is a big issue. Usually, people plan childcare in advance. Plus, the author's house isn't safe, and they have work that's hard to reschedule. The brother expected the author to drop everything, including a planned trip, and even wanted them to get rid of their marijuana, which is legal where they live.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the brother should have made a backup plan earlier. The author isn't obligated to help, especially with the short notice and considering their personal situation. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially the name-calling and public ranting. The author isn't doing anything illegal by using marijuana in their own home, and the brother's request is unrealistic given the time frame.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family obligations come first. But the author's reasons are valid: they can't take care of kids, they have work, and the house isn't safe. Also, the brother's own sister had to cancel due to a family emergency, so maybe they should have considered other options or asked earlier. The author isn't being selfish; they're setting boundaries based on their capabilities and personal life.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their refusal is reasonable given the circumstances, and the brother's reaction is disproportionate.\n"
