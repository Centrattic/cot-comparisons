I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is 23, part of r/childfree, and openly hates children. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they smoke a lot. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they have work commitments, including scheduled repair appointments.\n\nThe brother asked two days before a week-long cruise to babysit the kids. The author refuses because they can't take time off work (using PTO for a planned trip), the house isn't safe, and they don't want to give up their weed. The brother and wife reacted angrily, called them names, and posted on Facebook. The sister also thinks they should help.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider. First, the author has valid reasons: work obligations, personal preferences, and an unsafe environment. They were asked very last minute, and the request seems unreasonable. The brother had planned the trip for five years but didn't arrange childcare until two days before. The author isn't obligated to babysit, especially with their dislike for kids and the logistical issues. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them names and public shaming. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have communicated better or offered alternatives? But given the short notice and their stated inability, it's not feasible. The family might expect support, but the author's situation is valid. They also mentioned their house isn't safe, which is a real concern. The brother's demand to remove marijuana and babyproof in two days is unrealistic. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided honest reasons and had a right to refuse. The brother's response is more problematic. So answer B.\n"
