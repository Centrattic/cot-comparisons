I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author is 23, part of the childfree community, really hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it often. Their house isn't babyproofed. They work from home, have a side job fixing cars, and were saving PTO for a guys' trip. The brother wanted them to watch the kids for a week-long cruise that was planned for five years, but only asked two days before. The author refused, and the brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author has a legitimate reason not to babysit. They don't like kids, their house isn't safe, they can't take time off work, and they have a personal use for their PTO. The brother's request was last-minute, which makes it even harder. The author isn't obligated to help, especially since there's no mention of the brother offering payment or prior support. The family's reaction seems harsh, but the author's refusal is understandable given their circumstances.\n\nThe key factors are the author's right to say no, the last-minute request, and the personal reasons that make the request impossible. Also, the idea that family obligations don't necessarily mean you have to sacrifice your time and plans, especially when it's not feasible. The brother planned the trip for five years and should have had a backup plan earlier. The author's refusal isn't selfish if it's based on real constraints, not just laziness. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They clearly stated their reasons, and the brother's reaction is unreasonable. The author has every right to prioritize their own life and responsibilities.\n"
