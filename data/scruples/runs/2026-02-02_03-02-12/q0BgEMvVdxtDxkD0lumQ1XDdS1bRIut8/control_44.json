I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brothers' kids. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe author is part of r/childfree and openly hates children. Their family is aware of this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it regularly. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have a job and car repair business that they can't interrupt. \n\nThe brother planned a cruise for five years with his wife, and two days before, he asks the author to babysit. The author says no because they can't take time off work (using PTO for their own trip), and can't make their house safe or move their work setup. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister is pressuring the author too.\n\nSo, the author's reasons: personal dislike of kids, not a safe environment, work commitments, not being paid. The brother's side: last-minute request, planned for years, family obligation. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, family can expect some help, but the request is last-minute, and the author has valid reasons. The brother's kids are a responsibility, but the author isn't obligated unless there's a prior agreement. The author isn't being selfish; they're explaining their real constraints. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them names and public shaming. The sister's opinion is mentioned, but the author's situation isn't feasible. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. Their refusal is based on real-life constraints and honesty. The brother should have had a backup plan. So answer B.\n"
