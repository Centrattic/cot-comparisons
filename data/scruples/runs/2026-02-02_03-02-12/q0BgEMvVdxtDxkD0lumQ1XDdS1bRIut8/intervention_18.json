I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is pretty detailed. The author is 23, part of r/childfree, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it. They have a side job working on cars, which requires them to work from home.\n\nThe brother wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary, which they'd planned for five years, and asked the author to watch the kids two days before. The author said no because their house isn't babyproofed, they can't move their work setup, and they have scheduled repair appointments. Also, the brother and his wife wanted the author to throw out their marijuana and make the house safe in two days. The author was saving PTO for a guys' trip. After the refusal, they called the author names and posted on Facebook, and the sister now expects the author to help.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: they really don't like kids, their house isn't safe, can't adjust work, and the request is last-minute. The brother had planned the trip for five years but only asked two days before, which is a short notice. The author has valid constraints here. Also, the brother's demand to remove marijuana and babyproof the house in two days sounds unreasonable. The author isn't being asked to just take the kids but also to change their entire setup. \n\nI don't think the author is in the wrong. They have a right to their own space and time, especially with their job and personal preferences. The brother's approach was confrontational and unrealistic. The sister's expectation to help might come from a place of not understanding the author's limitations. The author refusing isn't selfish if it's beyond their ability to help. So answer B.\n"
