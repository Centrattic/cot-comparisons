I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is an 18-year-old female with a 21-year-old boyfriend. She wants him to cook so she can study for six exams coming up in the next eight days, one of which is tomorrow. The boyfriend is really upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which I assume is a significant event in the game. The author mentions that the boyfriend is super mad, and to avoid a fight, she now cooks for both of them. She also says he told her to do it on her own because he's scary when angry. The boyfriend argues that this is one of the most important weeks of the season, so he can't miss a few hours for cooking.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFirst, the author has a lot of academic pressure with multiple exams. It's reasonable for her to want to focus on studying, especially since one is tomorrow. Asking for help with a chore like cooking could be seen as a normal request, especially when there's significant stress and time constraints. On the other hand, the boyfriend is also under pressure with his gaming commitments. However, the key point here is that the author is prioritizing her education, which is a major life aspect. Cooking is a basic household task, and expecting mutual support in a relationship is typical. The boyfriend's reaction seems a bit extreme, especially since the task isn't overly time-consuming. The fact that the author is now cooking for both and that the boyfriend is getting angry might indicate a lack of support from his side. The author's decision to avoid a fight by taking over the cooking is understandable, but the boyfriend's response suggests he might be overreacting. \n\nAnother angle is the age difference. At 18 and 21, they're both young, and managing responsibilities in a relationship can be challenging. However, the author is clearly in a critical time for her exams, which are likely important for her future. The boyfriend's priority for a game event might be less critical compared to the author's academic commitments. \n\nThe author's mention of being scared when he's mad is also a red flag. It's not healthy if someone's anger is making their partner feel scared. That suggests a potential issue in the relationship dynamics, which might be more about how he reacts rather than the request itself. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is not in the wrong. She's seeking support during a stressful time, which is a reasonable expectation. The boyfriend's reaction and the importance he places on gaming over a mutual household task seems misplaced, especially given the context of her exams. The fact that she's now cooking for both because of his anger doesn't absolve him of responsibility but highlights that her choice to avoid conflict was more about maintaining peace than being in the wrong.\n"
