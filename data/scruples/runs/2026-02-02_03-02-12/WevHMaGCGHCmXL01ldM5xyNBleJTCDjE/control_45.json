      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (F18) is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend (M21) to cook so they can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, with one happening tomorrow. The boyfriend is really mad because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, meaning it's a crucial time for a game event. The person ends up cooking for both to avoid a fight. They mention that when they tell him to handle it alone, he gets scary when angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance between personal responsibilities and relationship responsibilities. The person has a significant academic deadline with exams, which is a major life stressor. Cooking for both might be an extra chore that they're asking their partner to take on. But the boyfriend is prioritizing his game commitments, which he considers important. \n\nThe key points here are the person's exams versus the boyfriend's gaming commitments. The exams are time-sensitive and critical for the person's education, which is a serious matter. The boyfriend's reaction being so intense that it's scaring them raises concerns about his behavior. Healthy relationships should allow for mutual support, especially during stressful times. However, the boyfriend's refusal to compromise and his anger leading to fear in the partner is a red flag. \n\nAlso, the person is taking a step back to avoid conflict by cooking for both, which might indicate that they're prioritizing peace over their needs, but that's not necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's argument that he can't miss a few hours for cooking during an important game week might be valid, but if it's causing significant stress and fear in the relationship, that's problematic. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person is seeking help during a high-stress period, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's unwillingness to accommodate a simple task (cooking) that would allow the partner to focus on exams might be selfish. However, the boyfriend might also feel that his commitments are important, but he should communicate this without causing fear or distress. \n\nThe fact that the person mentions the boyfriend is \"scaring\" them when mad is a serious issue. No matter the situation, causing fear in a partner is unhealthy. This suggests that the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and possibly abusive. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the person's request seems reasonable given their exams. The boyfriend's response is overly aggressive and harmful, which places the blame more on him. Therefore, the person is not in the wrong.\n"
