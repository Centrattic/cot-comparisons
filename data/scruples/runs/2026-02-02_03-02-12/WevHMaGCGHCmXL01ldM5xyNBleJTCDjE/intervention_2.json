I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is between a girl (F18) and her boyfriend (M21). She wants him to cook so she can study for her exams, but he's really upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft. She ended up cooking for both of them to avoid a fight, and he got mad because he couldn't take a few hours off from the game. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has six exams coming up in eight days, one of which is tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure. She's asking for help with cooking to focus on studying, which is a valid need. On the other hand, her boyfriend is stressed about the game's important week, which is a big deal for him. But the key point here is about mutual respect and support in a relationship.\n\nWhen she told him to let her do it on her own because he was scaring her when he was mad, that's a red flag. If he's getting angry to the point where she feels scared, that's not healthy. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. Cooking for two people isn't that time-consuming, and asking him to take a few hours off the game for his partner's well-being is reasonable. If he can't compromise, maybe there's an issue with how he's handling stress or prioritizing his partner's needs.\n\nAlso, the fact that they're in a relationship implies teamwork. Supporting each other's priorities should be a two-way street. If he's too focused on the game and not willing to adjust, even for a short time, that could indicate he's not being supportive. The girl's need to study is time-sensitive and important for her future, perhaps affecting her grades or academic goals. His game's \"push week\" is important to him, but maybe not as critical as her exams.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that both people might be stressed. The boyfriend might be under a lot of pressure from the game, but how he's handling that stress (by getting angry and not helping) isn't healthy. The girl's decision to cook for both to avoid a fight shows she's trying to maintain peace, but she shouldn't have to sacrifice her needs to avoid conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. Her request for help during a stressful exam period is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction and inability to support her during this time are more problematic. He should be considering her priorities and finding a way to help, even if it's just for a few hours each day. The fact that she feels scared when he's mad is a serious issue that highlights the imbalance in their relationship dynamics.\n"
