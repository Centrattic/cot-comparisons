I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend and girlfriend. The girl is stressed because she has six exams coming up in eight days, and she wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I guess is an important event in the game. They ended up fighting, and now the girl is cooking for both of them to avoid conflict. She also mentions that when he's angry, he scares her, and he said it's one of the most important weeks of the season, so he couldn't take time off for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to determine who's at fault here. The girl wants to focus on her studies, which are critical for her academic future. The boyfriend is prioritizing a game event. The fact that he's getting so angry that she feels scared is a red flag. Healthy relationships should have mutual respect and consideration. If he's refusing to help because of a game, that might indicate he's not prioritizing her academic needs when she's clearly stressed. On the other hand, he might feel that his gaming commitments are important, but maybe he's not being flexible. The girl is trying to set boundaries by saying he should let her handle it herself, which shows she's asserting her needs. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive since asking for help with cooking isn't unreasonable. The girl isn't wrong for needing support, especially during exams. The boyfriend's anger and the fact that it's causing her to feel scared points more to his behavior being the issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
