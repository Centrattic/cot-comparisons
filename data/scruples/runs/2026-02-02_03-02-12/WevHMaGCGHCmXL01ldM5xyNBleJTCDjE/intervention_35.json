I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's an important time for his game, WoW's push week. The author ended up cooking for both, but the boyfriend was angry and scary when mad.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: upcoming exams, which are a major life event. Students often need to prioritize studying, especially with six exams in eight days. It's reasonable to ask for help with chores to manage time better. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week in WoW is important to him, but how important is it compared to the author's exams? Games can be paused, but exams can't be rescheduled without major consequences like retaking courses.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems excessive. If he's so invested in his game that he can't spare a few hours, that might indicate a lack of support for the author's academic commitments. Also, the author mentions feeling scared when he's angry, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships should support each other's priorities without causing fear or conflict.\n\nThe author made a compromise by cooking for both, but that might be a temporary fix. The real issue is the boyfriend's inability to prioritize and manage his own time, plus his emotional response. The author isn't wrong for needing help to study, especially under stress. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own priorities not being met, not the author's request itself.\n\nSo, considering all points, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior and reaction are problematic. The answer should be B.\n"
