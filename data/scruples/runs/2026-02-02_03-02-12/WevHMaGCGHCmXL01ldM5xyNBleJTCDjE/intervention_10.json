      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which is a game. The author mentioned they ended up cooking for both now because they didn't want to fight, and the BF is mad because he can't miss the game. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has six exams in the next eight days, with one the next day. That's a lot of pressure. It's understandable they want to focus on studying. Cooking is a daily chore, and asking someone else to handle it temporarily could be reasonable, especially if they're in a relationship where they help each other out.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in the game's push week. If that's important to him, he might feel like his priorities are being ignored. However, the author didn't ask for a long time\u2014just a few hours for cooking, cleaning, and plating. The BF's reaction being \"super mad\" and causing the author to feel scared is a red flag. If his anger is making her scared, that's a bigger issue than the cooking itself. Emotional distress over a chore might indicate deeper problems in the relationship.\n\nThe author took the initiative to step back and cook for both, which shows they're trying to avoid conflict. The BF's insistence on not missing the game for a few hours seems selfish, especially when the author is in a critical academic period. Prioritizing a game over supporting a partner's academic needs could be seen as the BF being in the wrong here.\n\nHowever, communication is key. The author could have explained the urgency of the exams earlier, and the BF should have considered her academic pressures. But given the situation described, the BF's reaction seems excessive, and the author's need to focus on studying is valid. The fact that the author is now cooking both meals to prevent a fight suggests the BF's stance is inflexible. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for asking for help, especially with exams. The BF's anger and the fact that it's scaring the author points to him being more at fault. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
