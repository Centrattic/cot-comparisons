      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a female who's 18, wants her boyfriend, a 21-year-old guy, to take over cooking so she can study for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, with one exam the next day. The boyfriend is really mad because it's a big week for him in World of Warcraft, a game. To avoid an argument, the author now ends up cooking for both of them.\n\nThe author says she told him to let her do it on her own because he's scary when he's angry. He responded that it's one of the most important weeks in the season for the game, so he can't miss it, even for a few hours. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a stressful situation with exams, which is a major academic commitment. She's asking for help with cooking to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in a competitive gaming context, which he's treating as equally important. But the key points here are about how they're handling the situation.\n\nThe author's request is reasonable. Preparing for exams, especially six in a short time frame, is a significant responsibility. Asking a partner to share household duties is common and expected in relationships. However, the boyfriend's reaction is a problem. He's getting angry and not being supportive, which is creating conflict. The author mentions that he's scaring her when he's mad, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or intimidation.\n\nAlso, the fact that she ends up cooking for both of them after the argument shows that the boyfriend isn't willing to compromise. Even though he has his own priorities, he's not respecting her needs, which are urgent and time-sensitive. The boyfriend's stance that he can't miss the game's important week for a few hours seems self-centered. Relationships require mutual support, especially during stressful times.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The author has to back down and take on more responsibilities because of his anger. This indicates that the boyfriend isn't being a supportive partner. The author is trying to balance her studies and household chores, but the lack of support is making it harder. The boyfriend's reaction isn't helping the situation; instead, it's adding stress.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for asking for help. It's reasonable to expect a partner to share responsibilities, especially when there's a valid reason like preparing for exams. The boyfriend's anger and refusal to help, despite the author's valid reasons, is the issue here. The fact that the author feels scared of him when he's angry is a serious concern. That kind of behavior can lead to an unhealthy relationship dynamic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate, and his refusal to support her during a critical time, along with the anger that makes her feel scared, is the problem. The author's actions are about managing her own responsibilities and seeking support, which is completely valid.\n"
