I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author, a female 18-year-old, is asking if she's at fault for wanting her boyfriend, who's 21, to cook so she can study for six exams coming up in eight days, with one tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's push week for World of Warcraft, and the author now cooks for both after telling him to stop when he was being scary when angry. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author has a significant academic commitment with exams starting soon. Prioritizing studying is understandable, especially with exams starting the next day. It's a critical time for her academic performance. On the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in an online game's important event, which he considers crucial. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be causing conflict, as the author feels scared when he's angry. This could indicate that his emotional response is inappropriate or unhealthy in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are about priorities and mutual respect. The author is asking her partner to take on a household duty (cooking) so she can focus on her studies. It's reasonable for someone to need help during a high-stress period. The boyfriend's refusal led to a situation where they now both cook, but he's upset about it. However, his argument about game push week seems less critical compared to an exam that affects the author's academic future. Additionally, the author feeling scared when he's angry is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or intimidation.\n\nThe boyfriend's inability to compromise for a few hours to support his partner's important exams shows a lack of consideration. While personal interests are important, they should not overshadow a partner's academic needs, especially when the partner is in a vulnerable position. The author's decision to cook for both after he refused and became aggressive suggests that his response was not constructive. \n\nIt's also worth considering the balance of responsibilities. If the author is already stressed about exams, taking on additional tasks like cooking might add to her stress. Delegating that task to the boyfriend would be a reasonable request. The boyfriend's refusal and subsequent anger indicate he's not supporting her during a critical time, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn summary, the author is trying to manage a high-pressure academic schedule and is seeking support from her partner. The boyfriend's reaction, including anger and creating a scary environment, is problematic. His priorities (a game event) seem less urgent compared to the author's exams. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting support during such a crucial period.\n"
