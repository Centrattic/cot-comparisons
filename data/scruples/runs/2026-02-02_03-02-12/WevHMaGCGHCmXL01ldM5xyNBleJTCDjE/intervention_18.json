I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girl wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for six exams in the next eight days, including one tomorrow. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which is a game, and he's doing a lot there. Now the girl is cooking for both because she doesn't want a fight. She also mentioned he's scary when he's mad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girl has a lot of exams coming up, which is a significant academic pressure. She's asking for help with cooking so she can focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is stressed about his game, which he considers important. The push week might be a time when he's trying to achieve something in the game, which could be important to him. \n\nThe key points here are about prioritization and mutual support. The girl's exams are time-sensitive and critical for her academic success. The boyfriend's push week in WoW, while important to him, is a leisure activity. The fact that he's getting very angry suggests he might not be considering her academic needs. Also, the girl mentions he's scaring her when he's mad, which is a red flag for potential emotional abuse or at least a toxic dynamic.\n\nThe girl's decision to take over cooking to avoid a fight shows she's trying to de-escalate the situation, which is mature. However, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic because he's prioritizing his game over her studies and is upset about it, which could indicate a lack of support in the relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girl is asking for help during a stressful time, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's refusal and anger might be the main issue here. The fact that she's now cooking for both suggests the balance of responsibilities is not equal, and he's not contributing as a partner. \n\nSo, considering all that, the girl isn't in the wrong for needing help with cooking to study. The boyfriend's reaction and prioritization of his game over her academic needs might be the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
