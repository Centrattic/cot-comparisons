I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in the next eight days. The boyfriend is really upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I think is a game. The user now cooks for both to avoid a fight, but the boyfriend is mad, and the user is scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, the user's main argument is that they need to study for exams, which is a significant academic responsibility. It's understandable that they'd want to minimize distractions, especially with one exam coming up the next day. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is focused on an important game event that he can't miss. The key here is balancing both their priorities.\n\nThe user mentions that the boyfriend is \"super mad\" and that his anger is scaring them. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships should involve mutual support and understanding, not fear. If his reaction is causing fear, that's a bigger issue than just whose responsibility it is to cook.\n\nAlso, the user is taking initiative by cooking for both now to avoid conflict, which shows they're trying to be considerate. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own priorities than a balanced approach. It's important to communicate and find compromises, but if one person's needs are being dismissed or met with anger, that's problematic.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user isn't asking for the boyfriend to drop everything; just a few hours to cook. If the boyfriend can't make time for that, maybe he needs to adjust his priorities or find another way to handle his gaming commitments. But the user is in a critical period for their studies, so asking for help is reasonable.\n\nThe fact that the user is scared when he's mad is a major point. Emotional distress in a relationship is serious. Even if there's a disagreement, the way it's handled matters. The boyfriend's response shouldn't involve making the user feel scared. That's not healthy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the user is not in the wrong for seeking support during a stressful time. The boyfriend's overreaction and the resulting fear are more concerning aspects here. The user's actions to take over cooking to avoid conflict show they're trying to manage the situation, but the root issue is the boyfriend's reaction.\n"
