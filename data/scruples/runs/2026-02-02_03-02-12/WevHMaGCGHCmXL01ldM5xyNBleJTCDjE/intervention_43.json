I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girl wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for six exams coming up in the next eight days, with one exam the next day. The boyfriend is really upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I think is a game, and he's upset about missing a few hours of gaming. Now the girl is cooking for both of them, and she's worried about his anger and even feels scared when he's mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the priorities here. The girl has a lot of exams, which are important academic responsibilities. She's asking her boyfriend to help with cooking so she can focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is prioritizing his gaming time, which he considers important. The girl feels that his anger is scaring her, which adds an emotional aspect to the situation.\n\nI think the key points here are the immediate academic pressure versus the boyfriend's gaming priorities. Exams are time-sensitive and have real consequences, like grades or graduation, whereas \"push week\" in a game might be important to him but not as urgent or critical. The girl's request seems reasonable\u2014asking for help with a household task to manage her stress and study time. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, being super mad and not wanting to miss a few hours of gaming, might indicate that he's not prioritizing her needs appropriately. The fact that the girl ended up having to cook for both and is now in a situation where she's afraid of his anger when he's mad suggests that he's not respecting her boundaries or her stress levels. \n\nSo, in terms of fairness, the author is asking for help with a legitimate need (studying for exams) and the boyfriend is not supporting her, instead prioritizing his own activities. The girl's decision to take over cooking to avoid conflict might be a temporary fix but doesn't address the underlying issue of his reaction and her feelings of fear. \n\nTherefore, the boyfriend's behavior seems to be the problem here. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting support during a stressful time. The issue is more about the boyfriend's priorities and his reaction, which is inconsiderate and possibly harmful given the girl's stress and exams.\n"
