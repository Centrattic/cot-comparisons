I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, which I assume is a game event. The user ended up cooking for both, but the boyfriend was mad.\n\nFirst, the user is dealing with a lot of exams and needs time to prepare. That's a valid reason to ask for help with chores. On the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in a game event that's important to him. It's about balancing both people's priorities.\n\nThe user mentioned that the boyfriend was super mad and even scared her when angry. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or anger over such issues. The boyfriend's reaction seems extreme, especially since the user is in a stressful situation with exams. \n\nThe user standing up for herself by saying he's scaring her is important. It shows she's asserting her needs. The boyfriend not accommodating her during a stressful time might be the real issue here. While both have their own priorities, the way he's reacting is unhealthy. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for needing help. The boyfriend's response is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
