I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial week for his game, WoW. The user ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The user has a lot of academic pressure with six exams coming up, one the next day. That's a significant amount of stress. It's reasonable for them to want to focus on studying without additional responsibilities like cooking and cleaning.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's important week in WoW might require a lot of his time and attention. However, the user's exams are time-sensitive and critical for their academic success. The boyfriend's reaction leading to the user feeling scared suggests that his anger might be excessive or inappropriate. \n\nThe key points here are the user's need to prioritize studying and the boyfriend's reaction. While it's normal for both partners to need support, the boyfriend's insistence on playing during such a critical time for the user might not be considerate. The user's decision to cook for both to avoid conflict shows they're trying to maintain peace, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong. \n\nThe boyfriend's anger causing the user to feel scared is a red flag. Healthy relationships should support each other's priorities without fear. The user's request for help shouldn't be met with such a strong negative reaction. \n\nSo, considering all this, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to focus on exams. The boyfriend's response is more concerning here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
