I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a critical week for his game, World of Warcraft. The author mentions that the boyfriend is angry, and they ended up cooking for both. The key points here are the timing of the exams versus the game's push week, and the emotional impact on both sides.\n\nFirst, the author has six exams coming up, one the next day. That's a significant academic commitment. It's reasonable for them to need time to study. However, the boyfriend is also in a situation where this week is crucial for his gaming progress. Both have valid priorities. The author's request to have the boyfriend cook is about managing their own responsibilities, which is understandable. But the boyfriend's reaction being so intense that the author feels scared suggests a possible imbalance in how they handle conflicts.\n\nThe boyfriend's anger and the fact that the author is now cooking for both might indicate that he's overreacting. The author standing up for themselves by saying they're scared is important. Emotional safety in a relationship matters, so if the boyfriend's anger is causing fear, that's a red flag. However, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for needing to study, but maybe they could have communicated better or found a compromise. Still, the main issue seems to be the boyfriend's reaction and the author's right to prioritize their exams without fear. So, it's more about the boyfriend's response than the author's initial request. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
