      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial week in World of Warcraft, and to avoid a fight, the author now cooks for both. The key points here are the author's request and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: upcoming exams are a significant academic responsibility. It's understandable they need time and space to study, especially with one exam the next day. The boyfriend, however, is in push week for WoW, which is a major event for him. Both have important commitments. \n\nThe author told the boyfriend to let them handle it alone because he gets scary when mad. That's a red flag. The boyfriend's anger might be a problem if it's affecting the author's safety or comfort. The fact that the author is now cooking for both after the fight suggests a resolution, but the initial conflict wasn't about the cooking as much as the boyfriend's reaction. \n\nSo, the main issue is the boyfriend's behavior when angry, not necessarily the author's request. The author is trying to balance their own needs with the relationship, and the boyfriend's strong reaction might indicate he's not being supportive. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their studies and safety. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
