I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girl wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for six upcoming exams. The boyfriend is mad because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which is important for him. The girl now cooks for both to avoid a fight, but he's upset and she's scared when he's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has exams, which are critical for her academic future. Prioritizing study time is understandable, especially with the exams starting the next day. On the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in a game event that he considers important. However, cooking a meal isn't that time-consuming, and the boyfriend is refusing to help, leading to conflict.\n\nThe girl mentioned that the boyfriend's anger is scaring her. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships should not involve fear or intense anger over chores. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate. Prioritizing a game event over helping his partner study for exams might indicate he's not supporting her in a crucial time, which is a problem.\n\nAlso, the girl is taking on more work (cooking for both) to avoid conflict, but that doesn't resolve the underlying issue. The boyfriend's refusal to adjust his priorities even a little suggests he's not being considerate of her needs. In a balanced relationship, both partners should make sacrifices for each other when needed.\n\nSo, the girl isn't wrong in asking for help with cooking to study. The boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
