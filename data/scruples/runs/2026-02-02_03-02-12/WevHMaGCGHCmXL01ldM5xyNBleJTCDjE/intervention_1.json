I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the author (a female, 18) is asking her boyfriend (male, 21) to cook so she can study for six exams coming up in the next eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW (World of Warcraft), which is a major event for the game. The author says that when she told him to cook, he got mad and now she's cooking for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentioned that he's scaring her when he's angry and that he thinks this week is crucial for the game.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. So, I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFirst, the author has exams coming up, which are important for her academic life. It's reasonable for her to need time to study, especially with one exam tomorrow. She's asking for help with cooking, which is a shared responsibility in a relationship. It's not unusual for partners to split chores, especially when one is under stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in the game's event, which he views as important. However, the timing conflicts with the author's academic priorities. The key here is whether his reaction was excessive. The author says he's \"super mad\" and that his anger is scaring her. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve one partner making the other feel unsafe, even if they're upset. His prioritization of gaming over supporting her during exams might be an issue, especially if he's not willing to compromise or adjust in the moment.\n\nAlso, the fact that she now has to cook for both of them to avoid conflict suggests that he's not being reasonable. If he's truly in a critical gaming phase, maybe he could find a way to manage without cooking, or they could adjust their schedule. But his response of anger and making her feel scared crosses a boundary. The author's safety and well-being should be a priority.\n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. The author is justified in needing help with exams and is not in the wrong for setting boundaries when she feels unsafe. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
