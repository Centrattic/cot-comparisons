I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a major event in their game (WoW push week), and the author ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight. The author also mentions that their boyfriend's anger is scaring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance of responsibilities. The author has six exams in eight days, including one the next day. That's a significant academic commitment. It's reasonable for them to need extra time to study. On the other hand, the boyfriend is involved in an important game event. But the key point here is whether the author's request is unreasonable. \n\nWhen someone is under academic pressure, asking a partner to take on a small task like cooking could be seen as a reasonable ask, especially if it helps them focus on studying. The boyfriend, however, is prioritizing his gaming commitments over helping with cooking. That could indicate that he's not supportive of the author's academic needs, which are time-sensitive and high-stakes.\n\nThe author mentioned that the boyfriend's anger is scaring them, which is a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or aggression. The fact that the author had to back down and take on both cooking duties shows that the boyfriend isn't being cooperative. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The author did ask, and the boyfriend refused. If both parties can't compromise, that's a problem. But the author's main issue is their academic workload, which is a legitimate concern. The boyfriend's response of being extremely upset and causing fear is not acceptable. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to manage their exams, and the boyfriend isn't being supportive. The fact that the author now cooks for both suggests that the boyfriend isn't willing to make a small sacrifice, which is unreasonable given the author's circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's request was reasonable, the boyfriend's reaction was excessive and possibly harmful, and the author isn't at fault here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
