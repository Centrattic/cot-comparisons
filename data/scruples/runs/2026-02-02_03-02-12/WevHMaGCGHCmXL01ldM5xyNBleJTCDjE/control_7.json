I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a major event in World of Warcraft (push week), and the author now cooks for both to avoid conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's main need is to study for important exams, which are time-sensitive. The boyfriend is participating in a major in-game event, which is important to him. The conflict arises from both prioritizing different activities at the same time. The author asked for help, but the boyfriend refused, leading to tension. The author then decided to cook for both to avoid a fight but felt scared during his anger.\n\nConsidering the situation, the author isn't being unreasonable. Preparing for exams is a significant academic responsibility. It's reasonable to ask for help with daily tasks like cooking during a stressful period. The boyfriend's reaction, including getting mad and the author feeling scared, points to his response being more intense than necessary. While the boyfriend's event is important to him, the author's need to study isn't trivial. The key issue is the boyfriend's reaction and the author's safety in the relationship. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking support during a critical time, especially when it's a mutual responsibility (cooking for both). The boyfriend's refusal without compromise might be the problem here. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
