      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for six exams in eight days. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" for his WoW game. The author ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight, but the boyfriend was angry and scary when mad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author has exams, which are a significant academic responsibility. They asked their partner to cook, which is a reasonable request in a relationship. However, the boyfriend was adamant about not missing his gaming week, which he considers important. The author felt scared when he was angry, which is a red flag. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's priorities, especially when it comes to education. The boyfriend's anger and scary behavior when he's upset are concerning. It's one thing to have differing priorities but another to react negatively and make the other person fear. The author's decision to cook for both to avoid conflict shows they're trying to maintain peace, but that shouldn't come at the cost of their own well-being or academic needs. \n\nThe key points here are the author's valid need to study and the boyfriend's overreaction. The boyfriend's reaction being scary is a major issue. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're prioritizing their exams and the boyfriend's response is inappropriate. However, there's also a nuance here about mutual support in relationships. But given the emotional aspect (feeling scared), the author is in the right.\n"
