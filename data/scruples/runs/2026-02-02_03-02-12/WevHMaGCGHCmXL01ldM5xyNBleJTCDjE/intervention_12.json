I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which is a game. The author ended up cooking for both and mentioned the boyfriend's anger is scary.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid reason: six exams in eight days, one tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable to ask for help with chores to focus on studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend's push week in a game might be important to him, but can he really not take a few hours off? Maybe he's overprioritizing the game. Also, the author mentioned feeling scared when he's angry, which is a red flag. No matter the situation, making someone feel scared isn't okay. The boyfriend might be overreacting. The author isn't wrong for needing help; students often balance studies and relationships. The boyfriend's response seems excessive and possibly emotionally abusive. So, the answer leans towards B (author not in the wrong).\n"
