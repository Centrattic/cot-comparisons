I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams, but the boyfriend is upset because it's push week in WoW. The author ended up cooking for both to avoid a fight and mentioned the boyfriend is scary when angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has exams coming up, which are important. It's reasonable to need time to study. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in the middle of a significant event in his game. But the author's health and exams are real responsibilities. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top if he's getting angry over cooking duties, especially since the author is stressed about exams. The fact that the author feels scared when he's mad is a red flag. That suggests the boyfriend's behavior might be controlling or abusive in some way. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable\u2014just some help with cooking so they can study. The boyfriend not making time for a few hours when it's important for the author's future seems unfair. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The key points are the exam importance, the temporary nature of the request, and the boyfriend's inappropriate reaction. Answer B.\n"
