I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams, but the boyfriend is upset because it's a crucial time for his game, World of Warcraft. The author now cooks for both because they don't want to fight, but the boyfriend is still mad. The author says he's scaring them when angry and that he can't miss the game week.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to assess both sides. The author has a lot of exams coming up, which is a big deal. It's understandable they need time to study. On the other hand, the boyfriend has his own commitments, a \"push week\" in his game. Maybe it's a team activity or something important for ranking. The conflict is about priorities and time.\n\nThe author wants the boyfriend to cook, but the boyfriend can't because of his game. The boyfriend is upset, leading to tension. The author now cooks for both to avoid a fight but feels the boyfriend is being too angry. The key here is whether the author is wrong for expecting help during a stressful time.\n\nI think it's about mutual support and communication. The author is stressed with exams and needs help. The boyfriend has his own stress. Maybe neither is entirely wrong, but the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh if he's being scary when angry. The author shouldn't have to cook both if the boyfriend can't help, but is the author wrong for wanting that help? Probably not. They have a valid reason. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not being supportive or for overreacting. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
