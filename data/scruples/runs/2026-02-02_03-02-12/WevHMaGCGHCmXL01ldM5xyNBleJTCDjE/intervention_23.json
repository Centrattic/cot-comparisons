I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their boyfriend to cook so they can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW, a game, and the author now cooks for both after a fight.\n\nFirst, the author has six exams coming up in eight days, one tomorrow. That's a lot of pressure. It's reasonable they want to focus on studying. Cooking can take time, so asking their boyfriend to handle it seems logical. The boyfriend is frustrated because he's in a game event, which is important to him. But his reaction being so intense that the author feels scared is concerning. The author ended up cooking for both after the argument, which might show the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. The key points are the author's legitimate need to study and the boyfriend's overreaction leading to fear. The balance here is about mutual respect and communication. The author isn't being selfish by prioritizing their studies. The boyfriend's inability to compromise and his anger causing fear are on him. So the answer is B.\n"
