I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this. (Cleaning, plating for us both etc.) AITA??\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girl wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for her exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's \"push week\" in World of Warcraft, which is probably important for his in-game progress. They ended up in an argument, and she now cooks for both of them to avoid a fight. She mentions that he's scaring her when he's mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has six exams coming up in eight days, which is a lot of pressure. It's reasonable for her to want to focus on studying, and asking her partner for help with cooking is a common request in relationships. On the other hand, the boyfriend is in a critical week for his gaming commitments. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for wanting him to cook.\n\nNext, the boyfriend's reaction is important. He's \"super mad\" and she feels scared when he's angry. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships shouldn't involve fear or anger to the point where one person is scared. The fact that she had to start cooking for both to avoid a fight suggests that communication issues or imbalance might be present.\n\nHowever, the core question is about right or wrong. The girl's request seems reasonable, especially given the exams. But the boyfriend's response might be excessive, especially if he's not compromising. The key points here are the exams (a valid reason to need time) and the emotional response from the boyfriend. If he's being unreasonable or not considering her priorities, then maybe he's at fault. But the user is asking if the author (the girl) is in the wrong, which would require her request to be unreasonable.\n\nBut the girl's main argument is that she's stressed with exams and needs the time. The boyfriend's counter is that his gaming push is important. However, if he's reacting with anger and scaring her, that's a problem. The fact that she's cooking now to avoid conflict shows she's trying to maintain peace, but it's not a sustainable solution if he's not being supportive.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the girl's request was reasonable. Since she has exams, it's a valid reason to ask for help. The boyfriend's reaction, not the request, seems to be the issue. Therefore, the girl isn't in the wrong for making a reasonable request under stress. The boyfriend's behavior is problematic, making the girl not at fault.\n"
