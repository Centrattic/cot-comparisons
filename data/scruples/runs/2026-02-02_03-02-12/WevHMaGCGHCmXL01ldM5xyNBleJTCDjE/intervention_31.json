I eventually told him to let me do it on my own, because he is scaring me when he's mad. He said it's one of the most important weeks in the whole season so he couldn't miss it for a few hrs like this.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girl wants her boyfriend to cook so she can study for exams. The boyfriend is upset because it's a big week for his game, World of Warcraft. The author says she ended up cooking for both and the boyfriend got really mad, which scared her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has six exams coming up, one the next day. That's a lot of pressure. She's trying to manage her time effectively. Cooking dinner would take time she could use studying. On the other hand, the boyfriend is into a major event in the game that he considers important. He might be stressed too, but maybe he's not prioritizing her needs.\n\nThe girl said she told him to let her do it alone because he was scaring her when he was mad. That's a red flag. If he's getting angry to the point of making her fear, that's a problem. The boyfriend refusing to help because of his game might be a form of inconsiderate behavior, especially when she's in a critical academic period. \n\nBut wait, is it fair for her to ask him to cook when he's also stressed about his gaming? Maybe there's a communication issue here. Did they talk about the timing beforehand? If she communicated her needs and he still refused, that's on him. But if she didn't plan ahead, maybe she's part of the problem. However, the fact that he's getting angry and she's scared points more towards his behavior being the main issue. She's taking care of both cooking and studying now, which isn't fair. The responsibility shouldn't fall entirely on her during such a stressful time. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic here. The answer should be B.\n"
