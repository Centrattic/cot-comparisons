      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong (AITA). Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old female (F18) in a relationship with a 21-year-old male (M21). She's preparing for six upcoming exams in the next eight days, with one happening tomorrow. She asked her boyfriend to cook so she could focus on studying. However, her boyfriend is very upset because it's \"push week\" in WoW (World of Warcraft), which is a significant event in the game. To avoid a fight, she ended up cooking for both of them. She mentioned that when she told him to let her do it alone, he was scaring her when he's mad. He argued that it's one of the most important weeks of the season and couldn't miss it for a few hours to help her cook.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author has a lot of exams, which is a major academic event. It's reasonable for her to prioritize studying, especially with exams starting the next day. Cooking is a daily chore that can be managed, but if she's under stress, asking for help makes sense. On the other hand, the boyfriend is invested in a significant in-game event. It's important to note that the boyfriend's reaction was anger, which escalated to the point where the author felt scared. That's a red flag in any relationship\u2014physical or emotional threats are not acceptable.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he can't miss the push week for a few hours. But cooking for two people isn't that time-consuming, especially if they split the tasks. The fact that he's so upset about this suggests that he might be prioritizing his gaming commitments over her academic needs, which are time-sensitive and have real-world consequences. However, it's also possible that he feels his in-game efforts are important, but that's not a valid reason to dismiss her needs, especially when she's explicitly asking for help.\n\nAnother point is the author's decision to cook for both after the argument. It seems she's trying to avoid conflict, which is common in relationships. However, the boyfriend's reaction to her asking for space (saying he's scared her) indicates that he's not respecting her boundaries. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and support. If he's being abusive or aggressive when she's trying to study, that's a serious issue.\n\nI should also consider the age difference. At 18, the author is transitioning into adulthood, and managing exams is a significant responsibility. The boyfriend, being 21, might be more entrenched in his habits (like gaming), but that doesn't negate her needs. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being supportive or not. Supporting each other through challenges is a cornerstone of a healthy relationship.\n\nThe fact that the author had to take over cooking after the argument suggests that the boyfriend isn't willing to compromise. If he can't adjust his priorities for a few hours to help her during a critical time, that speaks to his lack of support. However, the boyfriend might feel that his own activities are important, but the author's exams are time-sensitive and have more immediate consequences on her future.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for needing to study and asking for help. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic because he's being uncooperative and his anger is making her feel unsafe. The boyfriend should be more considerate of her academic pressures and help rather than getting angry. The fact that she had to cook for both after the fight shows that he didn't take her needs seriously, which is a sign of imbalance in the relationship.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here\u2014he's not supporting her during a critical time and is reacting with anger, which is unacceptable. The author is taking steps to manage the situation (like cooking for both) to avoid conflict, which is understandable, but the root problem is his lack of support and emotional response.\n"
