Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used this money to create a secret room, which they've always wanted. The house is owned outright by the author, as it was given by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible, and they could have used the money for other purposes like paying debts, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to have fun with it. The situation escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9e moved out and might call off the wedding.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, since the house is the author's and they own it, they have the right to modify it. The bonus is their personal income, so using it as they see fit without prior agreements might be their choice. However, relationships require communication and mutual decisions, especially when major life changes affect both partners. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9e, which is a problem. The project caused significant disruption (tearing walls, moving out), which impacts their shared living situation. Even though the house is the author's, the fianc\u00e9e is part of the relationship and would be affected by such changes. The fact that the author didn't discuss it with her first shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and the partnership. While the author has the legal right, the ethical aspect is about respecting the partner's input and shared future planning. Using \"found money\" argument might not hold weight if the relationship's dynamics and future plans require joint financial decisions. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, especially if they are planning to marry. So, the author's actions, while legally permissible, may be ethically questionable due to lack of communication and considering the partner's perspective. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted without considering the partner's feelings and the partnership aspect, leading to significant conflict.\n"
