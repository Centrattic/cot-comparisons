Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author got a bonus after a long period of being unemployed, so they wanted to create a secret room in their house. They own the house outright because it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used for other priorities like paying debt or the wedding. The author argues it's their money and house.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are ownership and shared responsibilities. The author does own the house, so they have the right to make changes. The bonus is their income, so they can spend it as they wish. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that there should have been a discussion. Even though they're engaged, they might not be married yet, so financial decisions aren't necessarily joint. But relationships require communication and compromise. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, leading to conflict. The action itself is legal, but the social aspect is tricky. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid, but the author's use of their money is a personal choice. The situation is more about differing values and communication breakdown. So, is it the author's fault? Maybe partially, because even if they have the right to spend the money, not discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 caused the problem. But the author isn't in the wrong legally. The answer might be B, but there's nuance. Alternatively, maybe A because they didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since they own the house and the bonus is their money, technically they're not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is emotional but not their fault. So answer B.\n"
