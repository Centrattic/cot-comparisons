Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took their bonus money to create a secret room in their house is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's upset about the decision.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, which the fianc\u00e9 is really upset about. The fianc\u00e9 wants the money to be used for paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. The author argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and that they deserved to use it for something fun. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the person owns the house outright, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, marriage involves shared financial decisions, and even though they aren't married yet, they were engaged for two years. The bonus was a personal reward, but using it for a personal project when the fianc\u00e9 has different priorities could be seen as not considering their future together. The project also made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which is a practical issue. \n\nOn one hand, the person has the right to their own money and their own home. On the other hand, making a decision that affects their partner's living situation and future financial plans without discussion might be the problem. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, especially if they had prior agreements about financial planning. The author's decision to proceed without discussing it with their partner could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe question is whether using the bonus for a personal project without consulting the partner is wrong. Since they were engaged and planning to marry, financial discussions are part of that partnership. Even if the author had the legal right, not considering the partner's needs in such a big decision might be the issue. The fact that the project caused the partner to move out and consider ending the engagement shows how significant the conflict is. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" legally or in terms of personal choice, the social and relational aspect might mean they are in the wrong by not considering their partner's perspective and needs. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate or consider their fianc\u00e9's concerns, especially regarding shared future plans.\n"
