Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the person is asking if they're the asshole for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major fight with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for a while. They decided to use this money to build a secret room with a bookshelf door in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible because they could have used the money for paying debt, the wedding, or saving. She's so upset she moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nThe main issue here is the use of the bonus money. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9e feels it was a joint decision they should have discussed. Now, the author is wondering if they're wrong.\n\nLegally, the author owns the house and had the right to make the changes. But financially, the bonus was their income, so they might have the right to spend it as they see fit. However, since they're engaged and planning to get married, there's an expectation of shared financial planning. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9e before making the decision, which caused significant stress and conflict. \n\nIn relationships, transparency and communication are key, especially when it comes to big financial decisions. Even though the money was the author's, the project affected their shared living space and future plans. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt and the wedding are valid, and not discussing it shows a lack of consideration for the partner's perspective. The fact that the project made the house uninhabitable for her adds to the problem. \n\nWhile the author's intentions might have been good, the execution lacked communication and collaboration. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction, while extreme, is a result of not being involved in the decision. So the author's actions, though perhaps understandable, were inconsiderate and led to significant consequences. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the project and the use of the bonus with their fianc\u00e9e before proceeding.\n"
