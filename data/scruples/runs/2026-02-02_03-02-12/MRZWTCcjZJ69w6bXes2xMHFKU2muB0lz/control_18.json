Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo the situation is that the author got a five-figure bonus after landing a good job. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own, and used the bonus for that. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thought they should use the money for more practical things like paying debt, the wedding, or saving. She's even moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright. So legally, they can do what they want with their property. But since they're engaged, it's a joint decision-making kind of scenario. Even if the house is in their name, big renovations might affect the fianc\u00e9e, especially if they live there together.\n\nThe author used their bonus, which they consider \"found money,\" to do this project. The fianc\u00e9e feels it's irresponsible. The question is about responsibility and communication. The author might have thought they could decide on their own, but maybe didn't consider the fianc\u00e9e's perspective enough. Even though it's their house, financial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement, especially when it's a significant expense and affects the living situation.\n\nThe author's argument is about using the bonus for a personal dream, but the fianc\u00e9e's concerns are about financial stability and shared responsibilities. The fact that the project made it impossible for her to live in the house is a big deal. Maybe there was a lack of communication beforehand. If they had discussed the bonus money and agreed on priorities, this conflict might have been avoided. The author might have assumed they could decide alone, but in a committed relationship, major financial decisions usually require partnership. So the author might be in the wrong for not discussing it first, even if legally they have the right to do what they want with their bonus and property.\n"
