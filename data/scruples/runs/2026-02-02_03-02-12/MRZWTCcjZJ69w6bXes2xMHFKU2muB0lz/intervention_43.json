Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which they own. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing.\n\nHmm, the key points are ownership of the house and financial responsibility. The author owns the house outright, so they have the legal right to make changes. But they're in a relationship, so there's an expectation of shared financial decisions. The bonus is a personal income, but using it without discussing with a partner can be seen as selfish, especially if the partner has different priorities.\n\nThe author's fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this, which shows the disagreement is significant. Even though the author has the legal right, relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a major renovation, which could be seen as disregard for the partner's input. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, in a relationship context, major financial decisions should be discussed. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the lack of communication and the impact on the relationship, despite owning the house.\n"
