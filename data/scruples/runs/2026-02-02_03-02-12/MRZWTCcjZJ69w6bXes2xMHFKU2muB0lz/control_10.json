Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work. They used it to build a secret room with a contractor, involving structural changes like tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible because they could have used the money for other things like paying debt, wedding expenses, or saving. She's so upset she moved out and might end the engagement. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing.\n\nNow, legal ownership isn't the issue here. The house is fully owned by the author, so they have the legal right to modify it. But the relationship aspect is key. The fianc\u00e9e isn't just a roommate; they're engaged, planning to get married. Major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when they affect shared living space and future plans. Even though the bonus is \"found money,\" using it for a personal project without considering the fianc\u00e9e's perspective could be seen as selfish. The structural changes making the house uninhabitable for her adds to the problem. Communication failure seems to be a big part here. The author didn't discuss the plans with the fianc\u00e9e before proceeding, leading to a breakdown in trust and partnership. So while legally they might be in the right, emotionally and in terms of relationship responsibilities, they might be in the wrong.\n"
