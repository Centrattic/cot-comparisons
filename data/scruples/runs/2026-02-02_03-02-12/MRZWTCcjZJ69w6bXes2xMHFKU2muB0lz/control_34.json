Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work for years. They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is owned outright by the author (inherited from their grandma), so legally, they have the right to modify it. However, this caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9, who's upset because the bonus could have been used for shared financial goals like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. She's so upset she's considering calling off the wedding and has moved in with her sister.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and shared responsibilities in a relationship. The author owns the house, so they have the legal right to make changes. However, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the relationship and likely expected some level of joint decision-making, especially since the project significantly altered the house and affected her living situation. Even though the bonus is the author's money, major home modifications can impact both partners, especially when it comes to living arrangements and shared future plans like the wedding.\n\nThe author's argument is that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time thing. But in a committed relationship nearing marriage, financial decisions often require mutual agreement. The fact that the project made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 is a significant issue. While the author has the legal right, the emotional and relational impact is high here. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for shared obligations versus personal projects is valid. The author didn't consult with their partner on this major expense, which could be seen as self-centered, especially since the project disrupted their shared home.\n\nSo, even though the author isn't legally wrong, the relational aspect suggests they might be in the wrong. Relationships require compromise and communication. Using a bonus on a personal project without considering the partner's perspective and the shared future goals can be seen as selfish. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the decision, while legally permissible, was made without considering the partner's needs and the relationship's dynamics.\n"
