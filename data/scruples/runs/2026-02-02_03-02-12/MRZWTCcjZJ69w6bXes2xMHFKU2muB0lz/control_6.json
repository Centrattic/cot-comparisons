Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 using their bonus to create a secret room, and the other partner is upset. \n\nFirst, the key points here: The author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used that money to hire a contractor to build a secret room, which involves modifying the house. The house was inherited from the author's grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're considering breaking up.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they used their own money, which they received as a bonus. The house is theirs, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that the money could have been used for other things like paying off debt or the wedding. \n\nThe main issue here is communication and shared financial planning. Even though the author has the legal right, relationships often require mutual agreement on major financial decisions, especially when it affects the living environment. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now unable to live in the house and has moved out suggests the project is causing significant strain. \n\nWhile the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspects matter. The decision to proceed without discussing with the fianc\u00e9, especially for a major project that impacts their shared home, shows a lack of consideration. The bonus might be \"found money,\" but in a committed relationship, both partners' needs and priorities should be considered. The author's insistence that it's their house and their money overlooks the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about financial responsibility and their shared future. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and consider their partner's perspective, leading to relationship breakdown.\n"
