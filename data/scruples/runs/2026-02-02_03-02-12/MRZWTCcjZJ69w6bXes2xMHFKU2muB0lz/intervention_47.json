Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to build a secret room in their house, which is causing a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts as presented. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for years. They wanted a secret room with a bookshelf door, hired a contractor, and started construction. The house is owned outright by the author since it was their grandma's, so they have legal authority. However, the fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinking the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's so upset that she moved out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and mutual agreement in a relationship. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time opportunity, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels it's irresponsible and that major home renovations should be discussed as a couple, especially when it affects their living situation.\n\nOwnership of the house is a factor. Since it's legally the author's, they have the right to make changes. But in a serious relationship, especially with marriage plans, big financial decisions might require mutual consent. The fact that the construction is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds another layer. Even if the author has the legal right, the impact on the relationship is significant.\n\nThe author's argument about using a bonus for a personal dream is understandable, but in a committed relationship, financial decisions that affect both partners should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author didn't consider their shared future, like wedding costs or debt, which are common in marriages. The surprise element of the renovation without prior discussion could be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nSo, while the author's actions are legally okay, the social and relational aspects are questionable. The author might have failed to communicate their plans with their fianc\u00e9, leading to a major conflict. The bonus was a personal windfall, but using it for a project that disrupts their shared home and future plans could be seen as selfish. Therefore, even if they're not legally wrong, socially or morally, they might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and not discussing the decision together.\n"
