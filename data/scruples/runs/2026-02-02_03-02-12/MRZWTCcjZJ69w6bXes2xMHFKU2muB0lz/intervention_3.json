Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a big argument with their partner. The partner is upset because they think it's irresponsible and they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt or the wedding. The author owns the house and used their own bonus money, but the partner feels it's a bad decision.\n\nFirst, the author did use their own bonus money. Since it's their own money, technically they have the right to spend it however they want. But the problem is that they're in a relationship and planning to get married. So, maybe there's an expectation of joint financial decisions here. The author mentions that the bonus was a one-time thing, so they wanted to enjoy it instead of saving. But the partner argues that marriage comes with shared responsibilities and big purchases should be discussed. \n\nThe house is owned by the author, but the partner is living there too. Tearing down walls and making structural changes might affect the partner's living situation. Even though the author has the legal right to do it, it's causing significant disruption. The partner moving out suggests that the project is really impacting their life, not just financially but also in terms of their living environment.\n\nSo, while the author has the right to spend their own money, maybe they didn't consider the partner's feelings and the practical implications. The fact that they had a two-year relationship and were planning to get married might mean that major financial decisions should be made together, even if the money is technically one person's. The partner's anger seems to stem from a lack of communication and the sudden, significant changes without discussion. \n\nThe author's argument that it's their house and their money might be valid in a legal sense, but in a relationship context, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions that affect both partners' lives should be discussed. The partner's perspective is that this was a shared future, and such a big project without consultation is a breach of that. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't legally wrong, socially and in terms of relationship dynamics, they might be in the wrong for not considering the partner's input and the shared impact of the decision. The key points are communication, shared responsibilities in a relationship, and the impact on the partner's well-being and the future together.\n"
