Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after a long period of unemployment, which is a positive. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted. The house is owned by the author, so they have the legal right to modify it. But the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. She's even moved out and considering ending the engagement. \n\nThe key points here are communication and shared financial planning. Even though the author has the legal right to use their bonus as they see fit, in a relationship, especially when engaged, major financial decisions might require mutual discussion. The author mentions they discussed this, but maybe not adequately. The fianc\u00e9 feels her needs (wedding costs, debt, her parents' situation) were ignored. The project's scale affected their living situation, making it hard for her to stay in the house. \n\nThe author argues the bonus was \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9 sees it as irresponsible. Relationships often require compromise. The fact that this decision caused such a rift suggests that maybe the author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective enough. While the author has the right to their bonus, the way the decision was made and its impact on the relationship might make them at fault. The answer likely is A (author in the wrong) because they didn't prioritize communication and mutual planning in the relationship.\n"
