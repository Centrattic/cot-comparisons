Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is the asshole here. The situation is that they used their bonus to create a secret room, which upset their fianc\u00e9e to the point of considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of work for a while, and received a bonus. They used that bonus to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright. Their fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible, and they should have discussed the money together since they're planning to get married. She mentions debt, wedding costs, and wanting to save. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they had the right to do it.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility angle, even though the bonus is \"found money,\" when you're engaged and planning to marry, big financial decisions might need mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid because those are shared responsibilities in a marriage. The author didn't consult her, which could be seen as dismissive of her input, especially when major life events like marriage are involved. The fact that the renovations are disruptive and making the house uninhabitable adds to her stress.\n\nHowever, the author did own the house outright, so legally, they could renovate it. But the relationship aspect is more about communication and shared financial planning. Even if the money is the author's, using a significant part of it for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective can be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9e moving out shows the severity of the conflict, which suggests the author's actions had a major negative impact on the relationship.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, in terms of relationship dynamics and shared financial planning, they may have acted inconsiderately. The key issue is the lack of communication and not considering the fianc\u00e9e's priorities. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA being the author, so answer A.\n"
