Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a bonus from their new job after being unemployed for several years. The bonus is described as \"found money\" and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used it to create a secret room, which involved significant structural changes. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels this was irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married. She wanted the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The author argues it's their house, and they had the legal right to do the work.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, the author owns the house and can make changes as they see fit. However, the relationship aspect is more complex. The fianc\u00e9 feels her concerns were ignored. Even though the author might have the right to use the bonus as they wish, relationships often require compromise and communication. The author didn't discuss the project with their fianc\u00e9, which led to her feeling excluded and unheard. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship shows how serious this is.\n\nThe author's justification is that the bonus was a windfall, but the fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid too. Financial decisions in a relationship, especially when marriage is involved, should ideally be discussed together. The secret room project caused physical changes to the house that affected their living situation, which adds to the fianc\u00e9's frustration.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal sense, the relational dynamics suggest a lack of communication and consideration. The answer might hinge on whether using the bonus without discussion is seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's priorities. In relationship advice contexts, the expectation is often mutual decision-making for significant financial moves. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision, even if the action itself isn't illegal.\n"
