Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus from a new job to create a secret room in their house, which has caused significant conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, ownership of the house: the author says it's their grandma's house, given to them paid off. So legally, they own it. That part's clear. They used a bonus they received, which they consider \"found money\" since it might not happen again. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's their house and bonus money, so they can do what they want.\n\nNow, considering the relationship aspect. They're engaged, so there's an expectation of shared financial planning. Even though the house is in the author's name, big projects that affect the shared living space without mutual agreement can be a problem. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that this decision was made without discussion, leading to her feeling unheard. The fact that she's moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement shows how serious the issue is.\n\nFinancial responsibility is subjective here. The author sees the bonus as a one-time opportunity, while the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a resource to be allocated towards joint goals. The problem isn't just about the money but about communication and respect for each other's priorities. Even if the author had the legal right to make the changes, relationships require compromise and consideration. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the conflict, as it's disrupting their shared life.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong and the bonus is their personal income, the issue is about how they handled the decision within the relationship. Not involving the fianc\u00e9 in such a significant financial decision, especially when planning to marry, could be seen as a failure to consider their partner's feelings and future together. The fallout suggests that the author didn't foresee the impact on the relationship. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong due to poor communication and disregard for the fianc\u00e9's concerns in a major life decision.\n"
