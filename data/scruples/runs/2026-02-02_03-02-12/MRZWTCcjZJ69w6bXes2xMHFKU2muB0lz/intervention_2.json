Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. They provided a detailed Reddit-style AITA post where the author took a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a job after being out of work for a while, received a five-figure bonus, and used it to build a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the money was spent irresponsibly when it could have been used for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's their house, it's \"found money,\" and that the decision was personal.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, financial decisions can be a big deal. Even though the author owns the house outright, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that major renovations without discussing it first is a breach of trust. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding suggests that this isn't just a disagreement but a fundamental issue in their relationship.\n\nThe author's defense is that the bonus is their own and they have the right to use it as they wish. However, in a committed relationship, especially one where they're planning to get married, financial decisions typically require communication and mutual agreement. The secret room project wasn't discussed, leading to hurt feelings and a sense of disrespect. The contractor work causing the house to be uninhabitable adds another layer, as it affects their living situation and stability.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they have the autonomy to decide how to use their own money on their property. But the impact on the relationship is significant. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that the author didn't consider shared goals and financial planning, which are crucial in a marriage. The argument here is about balancing personal desires with the partner's expectations.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, even if they technically had the right to make the decision. The key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's feelings and the relationship's future. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
