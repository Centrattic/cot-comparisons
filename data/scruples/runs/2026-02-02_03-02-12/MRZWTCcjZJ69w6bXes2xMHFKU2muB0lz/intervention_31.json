Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They own the house outright, so legally they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the money could have been used for other purposes like paying debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and they should enjoy it.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author did use their own money, but since they're engaged, maybe big financial decisions should be discussed. Even though the house is theirs, the project is causing stress and the fianc\u00e9 feels left out. The author might be right in wanting to use the bonus for a personal dream, but not considering the relationship impact. Maybe they should have talked to the fianc\u00e9 first. But the fianc\u00e9 is overreacting by threatening to call off the wedding. So, the author's actions might be seen as not thoughtful, but the fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme. \n\nIt's a toss-up. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for using their money, but the lack of communication could be a problem. However, the fianc\u00e9's response seems disproportionate. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong, but with a note that communication could have been better. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The bonus is their money, and they own the house. The fianc\u00e9's issues are about shared financial planning. Since the author didn't consult them, maybe they are partially at fault. But the fianc\u00e9 moving in with her sister and ending the engagement over this might be too harsh. So, I'm leaning towards B because the author isn't wrong, but the situation shows poor communication. However, in strict terms, using their own money on a personal project isn't wrong. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is the bigger issue here. So answer B.\n"
