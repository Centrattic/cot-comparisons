Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work for years. They own the house outright (inherited from their grandma) and wanted to build a secret room in the spare bedroom. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible because they could have used that money for debts, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author has the legal right to modify their own property. They earned the bonus, even if it's a one-time thing, and it's their choice how to spend it. But relationships often involve shared financial decisions, especially when planning a wedding. The fianc\u00e9e feels the decision was made without discussion, leading to her moving out and considering ending the engagement. \n\nIs using the bonus irresponsible? That's subjective. The author might see it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, while the fianc\u00e9e sees it as neglecting shared priorities. The argument here is about communication and mutual decision-making. Even if the author had the right to do it legally, relationships require some level of compromise and discussion, especially when major projects affect shared living spaces. \n\nThe fact that the fianc\u00e9e is now considering ending the engagement suggests that the lack of communication and the impact on their home (tearing down walls, making the house uninhabitable) were significant factors. The author might have thought they were acting independently, but in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, financial decisions of this magnitude should probably be discussed. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily wrong in terms of legal rights, the social and relational aspect is where the issue lies. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared implications of the decision, leading to major conflict. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle is that they have the right to their money and their property, and the fianc\u00e9e is overreacting. However, given the context of a long-term relationship, mutual planning is important. \n\nI think the correct answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though they have legal rights, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's concerns (debt, wedding costs) and the impact on their shared life is a key issue. The author should have discussed the major project, especially since it affects the house they both live in and their future plans together.\n"
