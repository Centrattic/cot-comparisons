Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door, which required some major construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and they have the right to spend it as they like since it's their house.\n\nHmm. So the main issues here are financial responsibility in a relationship and the impact of the decision on the relationship itself. Even though the author owns the house, relationships often involve shared responsibilities and discussions about money, especially when it's a future spouse. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this is significant. \n\nThe author might not be legally in the wrong because they own the house and the bonus is their income. But in terms of relationship dynamics, not discussing major financial decisions with a partner can be a problem. Using a large sum for a personal project when there are other pressing needs (like a wedding) might be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that they expected joint decision-making, especially since they're planning to get married. The author's defense that it's their house doesn't address the emotional impact on the fianc\u00e9. Plus, moving in with her sister and considering ending the engagement shows the severity of the conflict caused by this decision.\n\nSo, even if the author has the legal right, the social and relational aspects here suggest that not consulting the fianc\u00e9 about such a significant expenditure might be the issue. The key point is whether the author considered the fianc\u00e9's feelings and the shared future plans. Since they didn't discuss it and it led to a breakdown in the relationship, the author might be at fault for not being considerate enough of their partner's concerns. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong, so answer A.\n"
