Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author got a bonus after a long period without steady work. They used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright since it was their grandma's. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because he thinks it's irresponsible, especially with wedding costs and possible debt. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is financial responsibility vs personal desire. The author has the legal right to do what they want with their house, but relationships involve shared decisions. Even though it's their house, a major renovation that affects the entire structure and living conditions might need some discussion, especially if they're engaged and planning to combine finances eventually. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a big deal because it could impact their future together\u2014like wedding costs, debt, and the house they live in. \n\nBut the author says it's their house. However, being in a committed relationship, especially with a wedding on the horizon, some level of mutual agreement might be expected. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset to the point of moving out suggests that this project caused significant strain. The author might not be seeing the emotional impact here. The bonus was a one-time thing, but using it for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective could be seen as selfish, even if legally they have the right. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally in the wrong, the social and relational aspect is where the problem lies. Relationships require compromise, and big decisions that affect shared life should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning and the disruption to their home are valid. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the partner's point of view and the potential consequences for their relationship, even if the action was within their legal rights.\n"
