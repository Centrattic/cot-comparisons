Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do whatever they want with it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the money wasn't used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or helping with the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they should have the freedom to spend it as they wish.\n\nNow, considering both sides. Legally, the author is right\u2014they own the house and the bonus is their own money. But relationships often involve shared decisions, especially when major changes affect both partners. The secret room project is causing the fianc\u00e9 significant stress to the point of moving out and considering ending the engagement. Even if the author has the legal right, relationship dynamics might mean they should have discussed the project beforehand.\n\nThe author mentions this was a fun project, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible. The author's response about the bonus being a one-time thing makes sense, but the fianc\u00e9's concerns about shared financial responsibilities and planning for the future are valid too. In a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married, major financial decisions might require mutual agreement. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 feels unheard and that the project has made living in the house impossible for her adds to the conflict.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" legally or financially, the relational aspect is key here. Not discussing the project with the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and priorities. The author might have acted without considering the emotional impact on their partner, which could be the real issue here. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong in terms of relationship responsibility, even if not legally.\n"
