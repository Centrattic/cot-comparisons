Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who asked the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a large bonus after a period of unemployment. They decided to use it for a personal project\u2014a secret room. They own the house outright, so they have legal rights to modify it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the money to be used for shared expenses like debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their choice since it's their house.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and mutual expectations. Even though the author has the legal right to modify the house and use their bonus as they see fit, relationships often involve shared financial planning. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without considering their input, leading to a major conflict. The author didn't consult with their partner, which could be a breach of trust. While the author isn't legally at fault, relationship issues often hinge on how both parties feel respected and involved in decisions that affect their shared future.\n\nIn many cases, major financial decisions that impact both partners should be discussed. The author's action of using the bonus for a personal project without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective might be seen as selfish, even if it's their own money. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement suggests the decision caused significant harm. So, while not legally wrong, the social and relational aspects might place some responsibility on the author for not communicating and compromising.\n"
