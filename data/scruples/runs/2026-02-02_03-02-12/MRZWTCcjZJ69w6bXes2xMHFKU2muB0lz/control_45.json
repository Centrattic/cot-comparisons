Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the fianc\u00e9 used a bonus to create a secret room, leading to a major conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They own the house outright, so they have the legal right to modify it. They hired a contractor to build the secret room, which involved tearing walls and digging the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, as the money could have been used for paying debts, weddings, or savings. The situation escalated to the point where she moved out and might call off the wedding.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Legally, they have the right to use the bonus as they see fit. However, relationships require communication and mutual agreement, especially when financial decisions affect both partners. Even though it's their house, the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and the disruption caused by construction are valid. The author didn't discuss the plan beforehand, which is a common issue in relationships. While the bonus might be seen as extra money, major financial decisions affecting shared life (like a wedding and debts) need discussion. The fact that the project caused the fianc\u00e9 to want to leave suggests a breakdown in communication and consideration for each other's priorities.\n\nSo, the author's actions were legally justified but perhaps lacking in emotional intelligence and partnership. They didn't consider their partner's perspective and needs, leading to a significant conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and prioritized their personal project over shared financial goals and their partner's feelings.\n"
