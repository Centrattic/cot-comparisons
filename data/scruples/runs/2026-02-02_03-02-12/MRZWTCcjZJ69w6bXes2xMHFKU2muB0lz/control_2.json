Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author got a large bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used this bonus to start building a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The author argues it was \"found money\" that might not come again, and they have the legal right to modify their own house. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she's moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author legally owns the house, so modifying it is their right. However, the relationship aspect is crucial. Even though they own the house, the fianc\u00e9 is deeply involved in their lives. The conflict arises because the author didn't discuss the plan with the fianc\u00e9 beforehand. While the bonus is a one-time event, the decision to spend it on a personal project without consulting their partner has caused significant strain.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a common point of contention in relationships. The author's stance is about enjoying the bonus, while the fianc\u00e9 sees it as irresponsible. The author's actions impacted the fianc\u00e9's living situation, making the house uninhabitable during construction. That's a major issue, regardless of legal ownership.\n\nEven though the author has the legal right to modify the house, relationships require communication and mutual agreement on major decisions, especially when it affects shared living spaces. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows how serious the breach of communication is. The author's decision, while legally sound, may have disregarded their partner's feelings and practical concerns, leading to the fallout.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author did something they had the legal right to do but failed to consider their partner's perspective and needs. This lack of communication and consideration for the partner's concerns, which led to a major conflict, makes the author at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties might have valid points. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is also extreme, but the author's decision to proceed without discussion is a key factor here.\n"
