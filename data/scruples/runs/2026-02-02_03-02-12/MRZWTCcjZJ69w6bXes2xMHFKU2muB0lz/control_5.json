Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author landed a good job after being out of steady work for several years and received a five-figure bonus. They wanted to create a secret room in their house with a bookshelf door and hired a contractor. The house was given to them by their grandma, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinking it's irresponsible to use the bonus money instead of paying off debt or helping with the wedding. The author argues it's \"found\" money that might not come again and that the fianc\u00e9 should discuss this with them beforehand. Now the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author used their bonus to do a personal project. Since the bonus is their money, technically they have the right to spend it as they wish. However, they are engaged to be married, which implies some level of financial partnership. Even if they aren't married yet, major decisions about shared assets (like the house) could require discussion.\n\nThe house is owned by the author, but if they are planning to marry, the fianc\u00e9 might expect joint decision-making. The project involved significant structural changes that affect the entire house. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for shared expenses like debt or the wedding are valid because those are common financial priorities in a relationship. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big financial decision, which might come off as dismissive of their partner's input.\n\nBut the author's argument is that the bonus was a one-time event and they had the right to use it as they wanted. However, in a committed relationship like an engagement, financial decisions that impact the partner should be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the relationship because of this suggests that the author didn't consider their partner's feelings or priorities, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they legally had the right to spend their bonus.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in legal terms, the social and relational aspects might make them the asshole. The key is whether they should have communicated with their fianc\u00e9 about such a major decision. Since they didn't, and it caused significant distress, it leans towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
