Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about using a bonus to create a secret room with a bookshelf door in a house they own, which caused a major argument with their fianc\u00e9 to the point of considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright, so legally, they have the right to make changes without needing permission. But the key issue here isn't legal ownership; it's the relationship conflict. The author's fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus was used for a personal project instead of shared financial goals like paying off debt, funding the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's a one-time \"found\" money and wanted to have fun with it.\n\nNow, from a relationship standpoint, even if the author has the legal right to do what they did, communication is crucial. They might not be in the wrong legally, but relationships require mutual respect and discussion of shared goals. The author didn't consult their partner before making a significant financial decision that affects the house they're both living in. The fianc\u00e9 feels the money was irresponsibly used, which could indicate a lack of financial alignment or transparency. While the author's desire to create something fun is understandable, the way they went about it without considering their partner's feelings and financial priorities could be seen as dismissive. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 now feels unable to live in the house and is seriously considering ending the engagement suggests a deeper issue than just the money. The author's actions may have triggered a bigger conflict about trust and prioritizing each other's needs. So maybe even if the author isn't \"wrong\" in a legal sense, they might be in the wrong in the relationship context because they didn't communicate or consider their partner's perspective.\n"
