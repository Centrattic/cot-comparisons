Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author received a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and considering breaking off the wedding.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright since it was given by their grandma. So legally, they have the right to make changes. But the main issue here is the relationship aspect. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the bonus could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, etc. The author argues it's \"found money\" and wanted to have fun with it. \n\nNow, even though the author has the legal right to modify the house, relationships involve shared responsibilities and discussions. The problem seems to be a lack of communication. The author went ahead with the project without discussing it with the fianc\u00e9, which caused a major conflict. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input was ignored, especially since they are planning to get married, implying shared financial decisions. \n\nUsing a bonus for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective might be seen as selfish. Even if the bonus was unexpected, in a committed relationship, big financial decisions should ideally be mutual. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. The author might not have considered how this project affects their partner's comfort and the relationship itself. \n\nSo, the key points are: legal ownership vs. relationship responsibilities, lack of communication, and the impact on the partner. While the author isn't legally wrong, the relationship aspect suggests that they might be in the wrong for not discussing the decision with their fianc\u00e9 first. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
