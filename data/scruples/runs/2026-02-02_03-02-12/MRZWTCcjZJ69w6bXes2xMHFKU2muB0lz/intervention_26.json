Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big fight with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work for a while. They decided to use it for a personal project, which they've always wanted. They own the house outright since it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more responsible things like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. The project is causing them to move out and consider breaking off the engagement.\n\nHmm, the author's point is that the bonus is \"found money\" from a good year at work, and they wanted to enjoy it. They own the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that decisions like this should be discussed as a couple, especially since they're planning to get married. The author's actions have made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, leading to her moving out.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they have the legal right to use their bonus and modify the house. They did use a bonus that might not happen again. On the other hand, this is a significant life decision that affects their partner, especially since they're planning marriage. Financial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement. Even though the house is the author's, major renovations that impact the living situation of the partner might need discussion. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and future planning are valid from her perspective. The fact that the project is making the house impossible to live in adds to the conflict.\n\nThe author might have acted without considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and the shared financial future. While the bonus is their own, major projects that affect the relationship and shared plans should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9's reaction shows that she feels her input was ignored, which could be valid. So, maybe the author did overstep by making such a big decision unilaterally, even if they have the legal right. That could make them the asshole here because it's about respect and communication in a relationship.\n"
