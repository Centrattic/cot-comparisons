Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author got a big bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is really upset about it, leading to relationship issues.\n\nFirst, the author owns the house outright since it was given by their grandma. Legally, they can do what they want with the property. But the fianc\u00e9 is angry because the bonus could have been used for other purposes like paying debts, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again. \n\nNow, considering the relationship aspect. Even though the house is the author's, the fianc\u00e9 is involved in the situation. They're planning to get married, so big financial decisions might need discussion. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before spending the bonus, which led to conflict. The project is causing the house to be uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, which adds stress. \n\nThe key points here are: legal ownership vs. relational responsibilities. The author has the legal right to use their bonus and modify the house, but relationships often require communication and mutual agreement on major expenses, especially when future plans are involved. The author's action might not be illegal, but it could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because they're affected by the decision, and the author didn't include them in the decision-making process. \n\nAlso, the bonus being a one-time event might be a valid reason to use it for a personal project, but the fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning for their future together are also important. The fact that the project is causing immediate living issues (moving in with sister) exacerbates the problem. \n\nSo, the author might not be \"in the wrong\" legally, but in terms of relationship responsibilities, they could be seen as not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and needs. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again. The author's actions are their choice with their own money, but the lack of communication and considering the partner's perspective is a mistake. So, in the context of a relationship, the author's inconsiderate action without discussion could make them the asshole, hence A. But some might argue it's their money and house, so B. However, given the impact on the relationship and failure to communicate, the answer is A.\n"
