Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're considering breaking off the engagement. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision since they're getting married.\n\nHmm. The legal aspect: the house is owned by the author, so they have the legal right to modify it. But the relationship aspect is more complex. Even though the money is the author's bonus, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that major life decisions, especially those affecting their shared home, should be mutual. The construction is causing her to not be able to live there, which is a big deal. The author's action might be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns and not considering the shared future they're building towards marriage.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's points are about responsibility and shared financial planning. She wants to use the bonus for debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author sees the bonus as a one-time opportunity. While the bonus isn't regular income, using it for a personal project without discussing with a fianc\u00e9 could be seen as not considering the partnership. The author's insistence on proceeding without consultation might be the issue here. Even if legally correct, relationship decisions often require compromise. So, maybe the author is at fault for not discussing the big expense and the construction impact with their fianc\u00e9, leading to the breakdown in communication and trust. So answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
