Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while, which they consider \"found money.\" They used it to build a secret room, which their fianc\u00e9 is furious about. She thinks it's irresponsible, as they could have used the money for debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues that it's their house and the bonus might not come again.\n\nSo the main issues here are financial responsibility, communication in a relationship, and ownership of the house. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they have the right to make changes. But the financial decision is where the conflict arises. The fianc\u00e9 feels that the author didn't consult her, even though they're engaged. The author might be right in wanting to use their bonus for a personal project, but relationships require discussion of finances, especially when major changes affect the shared living space.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 was unaware of the plan and the project is causing them to move out, then maybe the author didn't consider her feelings or the impact on their relationship. Even though the author has legal rights, relationships involve mutual respect and communication. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset and considering breaking off the engagement suggests that the author may have acted without enough discussion.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to use their bonus and make changes to their house, the lack of communication and the impact on the relationship could make them the asshole. The key point is whether they discussed the financial plans with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding. If they didn't, then they might be at fault for not involving her in the decision, especially since they're planning to get married, which implies shared financial decisions.\n"
