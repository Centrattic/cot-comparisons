Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author got a job after being out of work for a while and received a five-figure bonus. They used that money to build a secret room with a contractor, which involved significant changes to the house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking the money could have been used for more responsible purposes like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. She's so upset she moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author owns the house outright, so legally they can do what they want. But they're in a committed relationship with a fianc\u00e9. Even though the money is the author's bonus, using it for a big project without discussing it with the partner seems to be a problem. The fianc\u00e9's arguments are about shared financial responsibilities and planning for the future, especially since they're getting married. The author might have thought it was their own house and their bonus, but in a relationship, major financial decisions often require discussion and mutual agreement.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bonus was \"found money,\" but the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible not to consider other priorities. The fact that the project is causing the house to be uninhabitable adds stress to the relationship. The author's stance of \"it's my house\" might be valid legally, but emotionally and relationally, not consulting their partner is a big issue.\n\nIn relationships, even when something is your possession, big decisions that affect the partner or shared life should involve communication. The author didn't discuss it with the fianc\u00e9, leading to a major conflict. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but her feelings are valid because financial decisions impact both partners, especially pre-marriage. The author's actions could be seen as selfish or dismissive of her concerns, which is why they might be in the wrong. So, Answer A (the author is in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
