Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a big argument with their fianc\u00e9, who's now considering calling off the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, and started renovations. The house is owned outright by the author, so they have legal authority. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author didn't consult them, used the bonus instead of saving for their future, and the construction is making living in the house difficult. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, while the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and they should have discussed it.\n\nNow, considering the AITA framework, the main issue is communication and shared financial decisions in a relationship. Even though the author owns the house and the bonus is their income, major financial decisions in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, often require mutual agreement. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which is a red flag. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt, wedding costs, and the living situation are valid. The author's stance that it's \"their house\" might be legally correct, but in a relationship, especially pre-marital, such decisions can affect both partners. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 has moved out and the relationship is at risk suggests the author's actions caused significant harm. The author may not be the sole \"asshole,\" but they did act unilaterally without considering their partner's perspective, which is a mistake. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
