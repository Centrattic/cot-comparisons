Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person got a bonus from a new job and used it to create a secret room in their house. They own the house outright because it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or savings. The author argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and they have the right to use it as they want since it's their house.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9e is part of their life, especially since they're planning to get married. Using a significant amount of money on a personal project without discussing it with their partner could be seen as selfish. Marriage often involves shared financial decisions, so maybe the author didn't consider their fianc\u00e9e's perspective. Also, the project is causing them to move out and consider breaking up the relationship, which suggests that the decision had major consequences they didn't anticipate.\n\nOn the other hand, the bonus is technically the author's money, and they have the legal right to spend it. They might feel they deserve to enjoy their hard-earned bonus. However, the way the decision was made without considering the partner's needs or discussing it first is probably where the issue lies. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about financial planning for their future together are valid. Even if it's a one-time bonus, using it for a non-essential project when there are other pressing needs might not be the best approach. So, the author might be at fault for not communicating and not considering their partner's input, which is crucial in a committed relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
