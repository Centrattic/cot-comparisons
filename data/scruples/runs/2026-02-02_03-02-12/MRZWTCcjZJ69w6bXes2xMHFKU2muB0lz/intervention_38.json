Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author used their bonus money to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about it. The author owns the house outright, so legally they can do what they want with it. They argue that the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they could have used that money for other purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The conflict has gotten so bad that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about financial responsibility and relationship dynamics. The author says it's their house, so they have the right to make changes. But relationships involve shared responsibilities and discussions about money, especially when planning a wedding. Even though the author used their own bonus, the fianc\u00e9 feels that big financial decisions should be discussed together. The fact that the project is causing such a strain on the relationship is a red flag. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't wrong for using their own money for a personal project. On the other hand, maybe they should have discussed it with their fianc\u00e9 first, given the significant impact on the house and the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid too\u2014major expenses and home renovations could affect both partners, especially when there are upcoming commitments like a wedding. \n\nThe author's argument about the bonus being a one-time thing might hold water, but the way they went ahead without considering their partner's concerns could be seen as dismissive. Relationships require compromise, and ignoring a partner's financial priorities can lead to serious issues. So, while the author isn't entirely in the wrong legally or in terms of ownership, the social and relational aspect might mean they did overlook their partner's feelings. Therefore, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and caused a major rift.\n"
