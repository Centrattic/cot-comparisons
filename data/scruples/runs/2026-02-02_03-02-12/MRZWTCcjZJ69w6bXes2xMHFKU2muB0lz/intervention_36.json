Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using their five-figure bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person owns the house outright because it was given to them by their grandma. They used their bonus, which they describe as \"found\" money, to hire a contractor for this project. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, arguing that the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She's even considering calling off the wedding because of the stress.\n\nThe author's defense is that the bonus is essentially a one-time windfall and they wanted to use it for something fun. They also mention that the fianc\u00e9e didn't discuss it beforehand. But the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about financial responsibility and the practical implications, like the project making the house uninhabitable for her temporarily.\n\nNow, considering relationships and shared responsibilities. Even though the house is the author's, a major renovation can affect the entire household. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is upset about not being consulted is a big point. Financial decisions, especially large ones, in a committed relationship usually require mutual discussion. The author might not have done anything illegal, but in terms of relationship ethics, it's about communication and shared goals. The bonus was earned by the author, but using it for a personal project without considering the partner's input could be seen as selfish, especially when the project impacts their shared living space and future plans (like the wedding).\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong legally or in terms of ownership, but in the context of a relationship, not discussing such a significant financial decision and the impact on the partner's well-being and plans could indeed be the problem. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their partner's feelings and the shared financial responsibilities in the relationship."
