Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room, causing conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after a long period of unemployment. They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is fully owned by the author, so legally, they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the money to be used for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or other savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house.\n\nHmm, the legal ownership part is clear. The author has the right to modify their property. But the relationship aspect is more about financial planning and shared expectations. The fianc\u00e9 feels excluded from the decision-making process. Even though the author didn't spend the money on shared goals, it's their own money. However, major renovations might affect the house's structure and value, which could impact both if they get married. The fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering ending the engagement suggests the emotional toll is high.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they didn't consult the fianc\u00e9, which is a relationship issue. In a committed partnership, especially when planning to marry, major financial decisions should be discussed. The author might have been acting in their own desires without considering the partner's feelings. Even though the house is theirs, the relationship's health matters too. The argument over how to use the bonus shows differing priorities. The author's actions led to significant conflict, which could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate in a relationship context. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating and considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective, despite legal rights.\n"
