Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after a period of unemployment. They used it to build a secret room, which their fianc\u00e9 is upset about. The key points here are ownership of the house, the nature of the bonus, and the fianc\u00e9's perspective.\n\nThe house is owned outright by the author, so legally, they have the right to make changes. The bonus is described as \"found money,\" which the author sees as a one-time opportunity. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible not to use that money for shared goals like paying debts or the wedding. \n\nThe main conflict is about financial priorities and communication. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before starting the project, which caused significant disruption by altering the house structure. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is intense, even considering ending the relationship, which suggests a major breach in communication and mutual planning.\n\nEven though the author has the legal right to modify the house, relationships require collaboration. Using a large bonus without discussion might overlook the fianc\u00e9's expectations, especially since they're planning to get married. The surprise project leading to her moving out indicates that the author didn't consider the emotional and practical impact on their partner.\n\nSo, while legally the author isn't wrong, in a relationship context, the lack of communication and consideration for shared financial planning likely makes them the asshole. Answer A.\n"
