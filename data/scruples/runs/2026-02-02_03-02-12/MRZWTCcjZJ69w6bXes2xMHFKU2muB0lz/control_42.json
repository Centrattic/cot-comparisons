Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author received a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for several years. They used this money to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The house was inherited from their grandmother, and they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, feels it's irresponsible, and is considering calling off the wedding. She mentions they could have used the money for debt, wedding expenses, or savings. The author argues the bonus was a one-time windfall, so they wanted to enjoy it while they could.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are financial responsibility, communication, and respect for the partner's concerns. The author did have the legal right to use their bonus as they see fit, but the issue seems to be more about the decision-making process and how it affected their relationship.\n\n1. **Financial Responsibility**: Using a bonus for a personal project isn't inherently wrong, but if it causes significant stress and conflict in a relationship, especially when the partner has valid concerns about financial priorities, it can be problematic. The author's argument that it's \"found money\" might be valid, but if they didn't discuss it with their fianc\u00e9e beforehand, that's a communication issue.\n\n2. **Communication**: The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e before making such a large investment. Even if the money is theirs, major life decisions that affect shared living spaces and financial plans should be discussed. The fact that the construction made it impossible for the fianc\u00e9e to live there adds to the problem, as it's a shared home.\n\n3. **Relationship Impact**: The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9e moved out and they might end their engagement. The author's actions, while maybe not financially irresponsible from their perspective, have caused severe relational consequences. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt and wedding costs are practical considerations for a couple planning to marry.\n\n4. **Intent vs. Impact**: The author intended to create something fun, but the impact on their partner was significant. The fact that the project was done without considering the partner's input and the resulting stress points to a lack of consideration.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted inconsiderately despite knowing the potential impact. Here, the author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a major oversight. Even if the money was their own, the decision to undertake a major project that affects the shared home and causes such conflict is likely to be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is valid because her financial priorities are being sidelined, and the project is causing them to potentially lose the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their decision, didn't consider their partner's valid financial concerns, and their actions led to a significant breakdown in their relationship. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author isn't wrong because the bonus was their personal money and they own the house. But the relational aspect and lack of communication tips the balance.\n"
