Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author took a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and wants to call off the wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author owns the house outright, so legally they have the right to make changes. The bonus was a one-time, unexpected amount, which the author saw as \"found money.\" They argue that using it for a personal project is acceptable since it might not come again. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is angry because they wanted to use the money for debts, the wedding, or savings. She's upset about the changes to the house making it hard to live there. The author insists it's their house, but they are engaged, so maybe financial decisions should be discussed together.\n\nHmm. While legally the author can use their own money as they wish, the relationship aspect is important. Even though it's their house, major renovations affect the fianc\u00e9's living situation. The argument escalated to the point of moving out and considering ending the engagement. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong legally, but relationship-wise, maybe they should have discussed the big project with the fianc\u00e9 first. However, the bonus was their personal income, so using it without consulting might be seen as selfish. But the fianc\u00e9's reaction also seems extreme. \n\nI think the real issue is the lack of communication. Even if the author had the right to spend the bonus, involving the fianc\u00e9 in the decision could have prevented the conflict. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's feelings and financial goals. However, others might argue that personal money is their own to spend. It's a bit of a toss-up, but in relationships, joint decisions are expected, so maybe the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
