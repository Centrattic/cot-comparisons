Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is the asshole (AITA) for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a big fight with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author got a job, had a bonus, and decided to use that money to build a secret room. The house is their grandma's, given to them paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. They're planning to get married, and she wanted the money for other purposes like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. The construction is affecting their living situation, and she's moved out, threatening to end the engagement.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author has legal ownership of the house, so they can make changes. But the fianc\u00e9 is involved emotionally and financially. Even though the bonus is the author's money, the relationship aspect complicates things. The construction is causing immediate issues in their shared home. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before starting the project, which might be a big oversight. Even if the money is theirs, major home modifications that affect the shared living space and the wedding plans could be a point of contention.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9 feels unheard. The author insists it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing. However, relationships often require compromise, especially when planning to marry. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding shows how serious she takes this. The author might not have considered her perspective and the financial responsibilities of marriage. While the author has the right to spend their own money, the way they did it without discussion could be seen as selfish, especially given the upcoming marriage. The construction's impact on her living conditions adds to her frustration. So, even though legally the author is in the right, relationally, they may have made a mistake by not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision.\n"
