Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, and their fianc\u00e9e is really upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus from a job they landed after being out of work for a while. The bonus is a five-figure amount, which is significant. They wanted to build a secret room as a fun project, so they hired a contractor. The house is owned by the author, given to them by their grandma, so they have legal authority to make changes. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. She feels they could have used the money to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The argument escalated to the point where she moved out and is considering ending the engagement. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to enjoy it while they could. They also claim it's their house, so they have the right to make changes.\n\nHmm. So from the author's perspective, they had the money, had the right to use their house as they wanted, and wanted to do something fun. They might think it's their choice. But the fianc\u00e9e feels her needs weren't considered, especially since they are getting married. Financial decisions in a relationship usually require discussion, especially when it's a big expense. The author didn't consult with the fianc\u00e9e before making such a major project. Even though it's the author's house, big financial decisions can affect the relationship, especially when it's a shared future. \n\nThe argument went to a breaking point because the project made it hard for the fianc\u00e9e to live in the house. So, maybe the author didn't consider the impact on the relationship and the fianc\u00e9e's financial priorities. Even if the bonus is technically the author's money, relationships involve compromise. Using a large sum for a personal project without discussing it with the partner can be seen as selfish, even if it's legal. \n\nAlso, moving out and ending the engagement is a huge consequence. The author might not have realized how important it was to the fianc\u00e9e. So, while the author isn't necessarily a bad person, they might have overlooked the importance of communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Therefore, the answer could be A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
