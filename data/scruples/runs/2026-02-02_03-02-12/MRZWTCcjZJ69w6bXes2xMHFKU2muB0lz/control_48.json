Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author received a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used this money to start a project to build a secret room, which involved significant structural changes to the house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling it's irresponsible, and has moved out, considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe house is owned outright by the author, given by their grandma, so they have legal authority. However, the financial implications are a point of contention. The bonus is described as \"found money,\" possibly a one-time windfall. The fianc\u00e9 argues that the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or helping with the wedding costs. The author's stance is that they had the right to use their bonus as they saw fit, especially since it might not recur.\n\nFactors to consider: \n1. **Financial Responsibility**: Was using the bonus for a personal project irresponsible? The author's argument is that it's their money, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it should have been a joint decision. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is part of their life and the project affects their living situation.\n2. **Communication**: Did the author discuss the project with the fianc\u00e9 beforehand? If not, that could be a point against them. If they did and the fianc\u00e9 disagreed, then the author might be in the right to proceed if it's their money. However, the significant structural changes causing the fianc\u00e9 to leave suggests a breakdown in communication or consideration.\n3. **Impact on Relationship**: The project led to such a severe conflict that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement. Even if legally the author has the right, relationships require compromise. The author may be seen as not respecting their partner's concerns, leading to the assumption they're in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now living with her sister and the engagement is at risk indicates that the author's actions had a major negative impact on the relationship. While the author had the financial right to use their bonus, the lack of consideration for the partner's feelings and the significant life changes caused by the project might make them the asshole here. The secret room is a personal desire, but the cost (literally and figuratively) seems to have disrupted their shared life plans.\n"
