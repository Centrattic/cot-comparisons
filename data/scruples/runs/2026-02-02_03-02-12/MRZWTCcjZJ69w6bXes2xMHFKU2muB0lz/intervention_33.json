Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus from a new job. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted. The house is fully owned by the author, so they have legal right to modify it. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding costs. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their own house. The conflict escalated to her moving out and considering ending the engagement. \n\nNow, legal ownership is on the author's side. But relationships involve shared decisions. Even though it's the author's house, major renovations can affect the entire living situation. The fianc\u00e9 might feel excluded from financial planning, especially since they're planning to get married. \n\nThe key points are: the author's right to their own property vs. the fianc\u00e9's expectations of shared financial responsibility. The author didn't consult their partner, which could be a relationship issue. However, using bonus money for a personal project isn't inherently wrong. \n\nBut in a committed relationship, big financial decisions usually require discussion. The author's actions might be seen as dismissive of the partner's concerns, leading to the conflict. So, while legally they're in the right, relationally, maybe they're in the wrong for not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective. \n\nHowever, the author also has the right to their own money. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems extreme, but it's a real relationship issue. It's a tough call. I think there's a balance between personal freedom and shared responsibility. Since the author didn't force the fianc\u00e9 into the situation and the house is theirs, maybe they're not in the wrong. But the lack of communication is a problem. However, the question is if they're in the wrong, not just if they made a mistake. The answer might be B (No), but with some nuance.\n"
