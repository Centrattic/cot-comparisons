Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible. The key points here are ownership of the house and communication.\n\nThe house was given to the author by their grandma, so they own it outright. Legally, they can do what they want with it. The bonus is described as \"found money,\" which the author sees as a one-time opportunity. The fianc\u00e9, however, feels it's a misuse of funds that could have been used for shared goals like paying off debt or the wedding.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong because they own the house. But relationships often involve more than legalities. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 before making such a significant change, especially one that affects their living space. The secret room project has made it impossible for the fianc\u00e9 to live there, leading to her moving out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nEven though the bonus is technically the author's, in a serious relationship, major financial decisions usually require mutual discussion. The author's insistence that it's their house might be valid legally, but emotionally, it's a shared home. The lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's feelings is a problem here. The author may have acted on a personal dream without considering the partner's perspective or the impact on their relationship.\n\nSo while the author isn't legally at fault, the relational aspect is where the issue lies. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because of the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's concerns.\n"
