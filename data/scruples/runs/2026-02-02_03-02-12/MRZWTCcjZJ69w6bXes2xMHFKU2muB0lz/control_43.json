Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after a long period of unemployment. They used the bonus to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright since it was inherited. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, helping with the wedding expenses, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. The conflict has escalated to the point of considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility, communication, and respect for each other's priorities. The author's action might not be legally wrong because they own the house and the bonus is their money. However, relationships often require mutual consideration beyond legal rights. Even though the author has the right to use their money as they choose, the decision to do so without consulting their fianc\u00e9 could be a problem. The fianc\u00e9 feels disrespected and unheard, especially since they're planning to get married, which implies shared financial decisions. The fact that the project is causing living difficulties adds to the tension.\n\nThe argument about \"found money\" could be valid if the bonus was truly a one-time, unexpected windfall. However, the fianc\u00e9 might see it as part of their shared financial future, particularly with upcoming marriage plans. The author's decision to proceed without discussing it with their partner could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, even if they had the legal right to do it. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement highlights the seriousness of the breach in communication and trust.\n\nIn many relationships, especially when marriage is on the horizon, major financial decisions are expected to be made together. The author didn't involve their fianc\u00e9 in the decision, which might have been a key mistake. Even if the author feels it's their money, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that their future together should involve shared financial planning. The author's dismissal of the fianc\u00e9's concerns by emphasizing ownership of the house and the bonus might overlook the emotional and relational impact of the decision.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author might not be legally wrong, in terms of relationship dynamics and mutual respect, they could be at fault. The answer might lean towards them being the asshole because they didn't communicate their plans and didn't consider their partner's feelings and the practical implications for their future together.\n"
