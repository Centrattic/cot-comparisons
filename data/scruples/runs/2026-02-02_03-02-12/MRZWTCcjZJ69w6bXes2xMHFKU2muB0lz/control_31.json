Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who took their bonus to build a secret room is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's upset about the decision.\n\nFirst, the author is in a committed relationship, engaged, and they received a bonus. They used this money for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they expected the money to be used for shared goals like paying off debt or the wedding. \n\nThe key points here are communication and shared financial planning. Even though the bonus was given to the author, in a serious relationship, major financial decisions should be discussed together. The author might have thought of the bonus as their own, but since they're planning to get married, finances are supposed to be a joint matter. \n\nThe project also caused significant changes to the house, making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there. That adds practical issues beyond just the money. The author's stance that it's \"their house\" might be true legally, but emotionally and relationally, it's a shared space now. \n\nSo, the main issue is not just about the money but about not discussing the decision with their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 feels ignored and disrespected, which is a valid feeling. The author might not be a total asshole, but they definitely made a move without considering their partner's perspective, leading to severe consequences. \n\nAnswering AITA questions often depends on the relationship dynamics and communication. Here, the lack of communication and the impact on the relationship suggest the author is in the wrong. So, Answer A.\n"
