Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused significant conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after years of unemployment and received a substantial bonus. They used this bonus to build a secret room, which they've always wanted. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want with it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She's even moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author mentions it's their house and they own it, so they have the legal right. But the issue isn't just legal\u2014it's relational. The fianc\u00e9 feels that using the bonus wasn't discussed and that it's irresponsible. Even if the bonus is considered \"found money,\" the fact that they're getting married implies shared financial planning. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, leading to a major rift.\n\nThe author might argue that it's their money and their house, but in a long-term relationship, especially when planning a wedding, financial decisions should be made jointly. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the relationship suggests that this wasn't just a disagreement but a significant breach of trust or expectation. The construction also made the house uninhabitable for her, adding practical stress.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the relational aspect is where they might be in the wrong. Not discussing such a major financial and structural decision with a partner, especially when planning marriage, is a red flag. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because shared financial responsibilities in marriage require mutual agreement. Therefore, the author's actions, though legally justified, were careless in terms of communication and consideration for their fianc\u00e9's concerns.\n"
