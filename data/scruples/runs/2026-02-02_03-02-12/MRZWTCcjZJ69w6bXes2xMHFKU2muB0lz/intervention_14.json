Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a major argument with their partner. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author got a bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used this money for a personal project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room. They own the house outright, so they have the legal right to make changes. They argue that the bonus was \"found\" money and they wanted to enjoy it while they could. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is upset because they're getting married, and she thinks they should have discussed the money together. She wants to use the bonus for paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's now moved out and might end the engagement. The author didn't consult her, which could be a problem in a relationship where financial decisions are usually shared.\n\nEven though the author has the legal right to modify the house, relationships often require communication and mutual agreement, especially when it comes to significant financial decisions and home modifications that affect both partners' living situations. The fact that the author proceeded without discussing it might have caused the rift. \n\nThe key points are financial responsibility, communication, and the impact on the relationship. While the author's actions are understandable as a personal desire, not considering the fianc\u00e9e's perspective and the shared future (wedding) might be where they went wrong. Using a large bonus for a personal project without discussing it could be seen as irresponsible in the context of their relationship, even if legally they can do it. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and considering the partner's needs in a shared financial future.\n"
