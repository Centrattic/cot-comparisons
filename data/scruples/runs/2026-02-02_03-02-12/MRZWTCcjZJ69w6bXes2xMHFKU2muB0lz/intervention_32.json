Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the author received a five-figure bonus from a job. They used it to build a secret room in their house. The house is owned by the author, given from their grandma, so they have legal ownership. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, feeling the bonus could have been used for shared goals like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to use it as they wish.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, since the author owns the house, they can make modifications. However, relationships often involve shared responsibilities and expectations. The bonus was a joint issue because they're engaged, so financial decisions might be considered joint. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a significant purchase, which could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the bonus was unexpected and might not recur, so they wanted to use it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 feels the money should have been used for shared financial goals. The conflict arises from differing priorities and communication breakdown. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering calling off the wedding because of this adds weight to the emotional impact.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author had the right to use the money, the decision to undertake such a project without discussing it with their engaged partner could be seen as a failure in communication. Even if the house is owned by the author, major renovations can affect the entire household, especially when a partner is involved. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because shared financial decisions are part of a committed relationship.\n\nSo, even though the author isn't \"in the wrong\" legally, in the context of the relationship, they might be at fault for not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and not discussing the use of the bonus. The answer here would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and made a unilateral decision that significantly impacted their partner.\n"
