Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author received a five-figure bonus from a job they got after being out of work for a few years. They used the bonus for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. The house is owned outright by the author, given by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks the money should have been used to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. She's so upset she moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nThe author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9e feels it's irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married, and the project has made the house uninhabitable for her.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. Legally, the author owns the house and the bonus is their own money, so they have the right to spend it. However, relationships require communication and mutual decisions, especially when significant money is involved. Even though it's the author's money, the fianc\u00e9e's concerns are valid. Using a large sum for a personal project without discussing it with their partner, especially when they have shared financial goals (wedding, debt), might be seen as selfish. The fact that the project is causing them to live elsewhere adds to the tension. The author didn't consider her perspective or the impact on their relationship. So while they have the right to spend the money, the way they did it without considering their partner's feelings and shared future might make them the asshole. So answer A.\n"
