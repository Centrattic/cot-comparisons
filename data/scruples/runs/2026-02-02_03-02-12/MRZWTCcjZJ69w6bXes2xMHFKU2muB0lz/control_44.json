Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to build a secret room, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author received a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright because it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and their house to do what they want. The conflict escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the wedding and has moved out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. Ownership of the house: the author owns it outright, so legally they have the right to make changes. However, since they're engaged, maybe there are expectations of shared decision-making. Financial responsibility: the bonus is a one-time event, but the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about financial planning and using the funds for more practical purposes. The project seems significant (digging up foundation, tearing walls), which might be seen as a major change affecting the whole house. The emotional impact is high, leading to the fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering breaking up the engagement.\n\nLegal ownership is on the author's side, but relationships often involve more than legal rights. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that big financial decisions should be mutual, especially since they're planning to marry. The secret room is a personal desire, but the way it's handled\u2014starting construction without discussion\u2014could be a problem. The author's stance of \"it's my house\" might dismiss the fianc\u00e9's feelings and input, which is a relationship issue. The use of the bonus as a one-time thing is an argument, but if the fianc\u00e9 had a different expectation, that's a communication problem.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to their property. On the other, big financial and structural decisions might require discussion in a committed relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement suggests this is a major issue for her. The author's actions led to a breakdown in communication and trust, which is a significant relationship problem. Even if legally correct, the social aspect of being in a partnership might mean the author should have consulted their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding with such a large project. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and their decision affected the relationship, which is more important than individual desires.\n"
