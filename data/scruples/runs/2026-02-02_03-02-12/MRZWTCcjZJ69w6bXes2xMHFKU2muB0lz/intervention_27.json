Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their home, which caused a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author got a big bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted to build this secret room, which they've always thought was cool. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. They argue the bonus is like found money and they should enjoy it while they can.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is upset. She thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. They could have used it to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The project is causing her to not be able to live in the house anymore, which is a real issue. She's even considering calling off the wedding because of this.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author might think it's their money to do with as they please, but since they're engaged, major financial decisions might need mutual agreement. The fact that the project is disrupting their living space and causing such a rift suggests that maybe the author didn't consider how this would affect their partner. Even though the house is theirs, the fianc\u00e9 is involved in the relationship, and big projects like this can impact the other person. \n\nAlso, the bonus was a windfall, but if they are planning to get married, combining finances is usually expected. So using a large portion of their shared bonus (since they're engaged) without discussing it properly could be seen as not being considerate of their partner's needs and future plans. The author might have assumed they had the right to spend it as they wanted, but in a committed relationship, financial decisions should be made together. \n\nThe fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now living with her sister and considering ending the relationship shows how serious the issue is. The author's actions, while not illegal, might have been selfish in not considering the partner's perspective and the shared future. So, even though the author owns the house, the way they handled the bonus and the project without discussing it fully with their fianc\u00e9 could make them the asshole here.\n"
