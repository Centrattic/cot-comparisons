Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major rift in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author received a five-figure bonus from a job after being out of steady work. They used it to build a secret room, which the fianc\u00e9 is upset about. The house is owned by the author, so legally, they can do what they want with it. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that using the bonus was irresponsible, especially since they're planning to get married and there are other financial priorities like debt, the wedding, and saving.\n\nThe author argues that the bonus is \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 feels it was a major decision without discussion. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 moved in with her sister and is considering ending the engagement is significant.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships, when partners are planning to marry, major financial decisions should ideally be discussed. The author might not have considered that the fianc\u00e9 had different priorities. Even though the house is the author's, the project affects their living situation and shared future plans. The contractor work causing disruption adds to the stress.\n\nThe author's defense is that it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing. But in a committed relationship, especially when engaged, financial decisions that impact both partners' lives should be made together. The fact that the author went ahead without discussing it shows a lack of communication, which is a common relationship issue.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for wanting to use their bonus, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's perspective is a problem. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is valid because it's a shared future. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision-making process, even if the action itself was legally permissible.\n"
