Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is getting a bonus after landing a good job, which is a five-figure amount. They used this bonus to create a secret room in their house, involving a contractor tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The house was given to them by their grandma, paid off, so they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think using the bonus was irresponsible. She thinks the money could have been used to pay off debt, help with the wedding costs, or saved. The author argues that the bonus was like \"found money\" and they wanted to use it for something fun. The situation has escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 moved in with her sister and they might break up.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ownership of the house, the use of the bonus money, and the impact on the relationship. The author owns the house, so they have the legal right to modify it. However, they are engaged to someone who's not happy with the decision. The bonus is their personal income, so they might have the right to spend it as they wish. But relationships often involve shared financial decisions, especially when major expenses are involved.\n\nThe author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making the changes, which caused significant disruption. Even though it's their house and their bonus, big projects can affect both partners. The fianc\u00e9 feels her concerns were ignored, which is a valid point. The author's reasoning is that it's their money and house, but relationships require compromise. The fact that they are getting married suggests that financial planning should be discussed together. The author's actions might be seen as selfish or not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective, leading to the relationship problems. However, the author isn't legally wrong, but ethically, they might have failed to communicate and consider their partner's feelings. So, depending on the perspective, the answer could be A or B. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong in a social context (like AITA), the answer might be A because they didn't consider their partner's input, leading to major conflict. But others might say it's their money, so B. Hmm.\n"
