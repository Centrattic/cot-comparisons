Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, causing a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person received a bonus, which they consider \"found money\" and used it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they thought the money should have been used for shared goals like paying off debt or the wedding. The author owns the house outright and did the renovation without consulting the fianc\u00e9, leading to the fianc\u00e9 moving out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has the legal right to modify their house, and the bonus is their own money. But in a relationship, especially one as serious as a fianc\u00e9 stage, major financial decisions usually require discussion. The author might have thought using the bonus for fun was okay, but it caused significant stress and conflict. The fianc\u00e9 feels their priorities were ignored, which is a valid concern. Relationships often require compromise. The author didn't consult the partner on a big expense that affects their shared living space and future plans. Even though the house is the author's, the renovation impacted the fianc\u00e9's ability to live there. \n\nSo while the author isn't breaking any laws, the social and relational expectations in a committed relationship might mean they should have discussed the decision. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset to the point of ending the engagement suggests that the author's actions were a breach of trust or communication. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and financial goals.\n"
