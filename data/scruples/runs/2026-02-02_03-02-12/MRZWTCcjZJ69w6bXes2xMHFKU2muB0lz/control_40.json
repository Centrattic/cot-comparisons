Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in a house, which caused a huge argument with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being out of steady work. They used it for a personal project, a secret room with a bookshelf door. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to use it as they wish. Now the fianc\u00e9 is threatening to call off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about responsibility, shared financial decisions in a relationship, and respect for each other's priorities. Even though the author owns the house, they are engaged, so major financial decisions might need mutual agreement. The bonus isn't \"found money\" if it's part of their shared financial future. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for debt or the wedding are valid because those are common financial priorities in a relationship. The author might have assumed they could spend the bonus freely without discussing it, which could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's needs and plans. \n\nAlso, the project caused physical changes to the house, making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there, which added to the stress. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 left to stay with her sister shows the severity of the conflict. The author's insistence on doing what they want without considering the partner's feelings and the relationship's stability seems to be the main issue here. \n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and financial impact on the relationship suggests they might be in the wrong. The answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and prioritized a personal project over shared financial planning and the relationship's well-being.\n"
