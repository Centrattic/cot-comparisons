Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author got a job after being out of steady work for a while. They received a five-figure bonus, which they considered as \"found money\" that might not come again. They used this bonus to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright because it was given to them by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks they should have discussed using the bonus for more practical things like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's so upset that she moved out and is considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The author argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and their house, so they could do what they want with their money. The fianc\u00e9e feels that major financial decisions should be made together, especially since they're about to get married. The author didn't consult her, leading to conflict.\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to marry, shared financial decisions are important. Even though the author has the legal right to modify their house, the emotional impact on the fianc\u00e9e is significant. The fact that the project caused them to move out and consider ending the engagement suggests that the author didn't consider the relationship's dynamics. The bonus might be the author's money, but in a serious relationship, big decisions that affect both partners should be discussed. The author didn't involve the fianc\u00e9e, which led to her feeling disregarded. So, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal or absolute sense, they did overlook the importance of communication and mutual decision-making in a committed relationship. That makes them at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n"
