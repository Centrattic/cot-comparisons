Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using their bonus to create a secret room in their house without consulting their fianc\u00e9, leading to a major argument and possible breakup.\n\nFirst, the author received a bonus from their job, which they consider \"found money.\" They own their house outright, so they have legal authority to modify it. The project involves significant structural changes, like tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or helping with the wedding costs. She also can't live in the house anymore due to the construction, leading her to move in with her sister.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author argues it's their money and their house, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that such a large decision should be a joint one, especially since they are planning to get married. Even though the author owns the house, making major structural changes without discussing it with their partner could be seen as dismissive of their partner's concerns and financial priorities.\n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship can be tricky. Even if the money is technically the author's, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that since they are about to marry, big financial commitments should be mutual. The fact that the project is causing them to move out and potentially end the engagement adds to the gravity of the situation. The author's stance that it's their house and money doesn't account for the shared future they're planning, which includes financial responsibilities like a wedding.\n\nAlso, the contractor work is causing immediate living issues, which adds pressure. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is likely not just about the money but also about the lack of communication and consideration for her feelings and practical concerns. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consult their partner on a major financial decision that affects their shared life and future together. Even though the author has legal rights, relationships require mutual respect and discussion, especially when it comes to shared living spaces and financial planning.\n\nSo, considering the impact on the relationship and the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about financial responsibility and communication, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
