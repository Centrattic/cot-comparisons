Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took a bonus to create a secret room is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's upset about the financial decision and the disruption to their home.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it for a personal project they've always wanted. They own the house outright, so legally, they can do what they want. But the fianc\u00e9 is furious, feeling it's irresponsible and that they should have discussed it together. They're even considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 thinks they should have used it for more practical purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. Also, the construction is making living in the house impossible, adding to her stress.\n\nNow, while the author has the legal right to use their bonus as they wish, relationships require mutual decision-making, especially when a major project affects both people's lives. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is being forced to live through the construction and that this led to her moving out suggests a lack of consideration for her feelings and input. Even if the money is the author's, big life decisions, especially those impacting shared living spaces and future plans (like a wedding), should involve the partner. The author didn't consult her, which seems to be the main issue here. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about practicality and shared responsibilities are valid. So, while the author isn't necessarily a jerk for wanting to do something fun with their bonus, the failure to communicate and consider the partner's perspective might make them the asshole in the situation. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
