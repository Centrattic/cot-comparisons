Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're considering breaking off the wedding. The house is owned outright by the author, so legally they can do what they want.\n\nNow, the key points here: the bonus was unexpected and might not happen again. The author sees it as \"found money\" to enjoy. The fianc\u00e9 argues that they should have discussed major financial decisions, especially since they're planning to get married. The construction is making the house uninhabitable, adding to her stress.\n\nLegally, the author has the right to use their money as they see fit. However, relationships often involve compromise. Even though the house is the author's, big projects that affect shared living space and financial planning should involve discussion. The fianc\u00e9 feels left out of the decision, which is a valid emotional concern. The author might not be legally wrong, but in a committed relationship, financial decisions that impact both partners should be mutual. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows how serious this is. So, while the author isn't legally at fault, relationally, they might have overlooked the importance of communication and shared planning. That could make them the asshole in the relationship context.\n"
