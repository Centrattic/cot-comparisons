Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got a bonus, used it to create a secret room in their house, and the fianc\u00e9e is upset. The author owns the house outright, so they have legal rights to modify it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author used their own bonus money, which they describe as \"found money\" that might not come again. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they could have used the money for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. But the author argues it's their house and they had the right to spend the bonus as they wanted.\n\nNow, the main conflict here is about financial priorities and communication. The author didn't discuss the project with their fianc\u00e9e beforehand, which is a common issue in relationships. Even though the author has the legal right to modify the house, the decision to use the bonus without consulting their partner might have been a mistake. The fianc\u00e9e is considering ending the wedding, which shows how significant this issue is for her.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the construction on their living situation. Tearing down walls and digging up the foundation could make the house uninhabitable, which adds stress and practical problems. The author might not have considered how this project would affect their fianc\u00e9e's daily life and their relationship.\n\nHowever, the author did own the house and had the right to use their bonus as they saw fit. The bonus was unexpected, so using it for a personal project isn't inherently wrong. But relationships require communication and mutual decision-making, especially when major financial decisions are involved. The author's failure to discuss this with their fianc\u00e9e first might be the root of the problem.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, the relational aspect is where things went awry. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is valid because she feels her input was ignored, which is important in a committed relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting their partner before proceeding with such a significant and disruptive project.\n"
