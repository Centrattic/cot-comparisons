Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the author used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a huge rift with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, and started modifying the house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it was irresponsible to use the bonus instead of paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She's even moved in with her sister and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nThe house was given to the author by their grandma, so they own it outright. The author's argument is that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time thing, so they should enjoy it while they can. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a joint decision, especially since they're getting married, and the modifications have made the house hard to live in.\n\nHmm. So, is the author wrong? Well, using a bonus for a personal project might be a judgment call. Bonuses are part of your income, even if they're unexpected. But the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that since they're planning to marry, major financial decisions should be discussed. The author didn't consult them, which could be a problem. Even if the author owns the house, making significant structural changes without considering the partner's input can lead to issues, especially when it affects the entire household.\n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now unable to live in the house because of the construction is a big deal. It's not just about the money but also the disruption caused. The author might have thought they were being responsible by using their own bonus, but maybe they overlooked the impact on the relationship. In a committed relationship nearing marriage, financial decisions that affect both partners should ideally be mutual. The author's action might be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns and financial priorities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did own the house and the bonus is their income. They might not see it as fair to have to consult for every personal expenditure, especially if it's a one-time windfall. But the key here is that the project is causing significant problems in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests deep dissatisfaction, possibly feeling disrespected or unheard.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author isn't legally in the wrong, relationship-wise, they might have failed to communicate and consider their partner's feelings. The fact that the project is causing such a major conflict, leading to the possibility of ending the engagement, indicates that the author's actions have serious consequences beyond just financial. So, even if the author isn't legally or financially wrong, they might be at fault in terms of relationship management and respect for their partner's concerns.\n"
