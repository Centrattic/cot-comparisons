Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used it to build a secret room, which involved significant construction. The house is owned outright by the author, inherited from their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying debt, wedding costs, or saving. She's so upset she's moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author has legal right to modify the house since they own it. The bonus was a one-time windfall, which the author considers \"found money.\" The fianc\u00e9 feels that major life decisions, like using a large sum of money, should be discussed and agreed upon, especially since they're planning to get married. The construction is making the house uninhabitable for her, adding to her stress.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they have the legal right to use their money as they see fit. The bonus was a personal achievement, and they wanted to do something they've always dreamed of. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels excluded from major financial decisions that affect both of them, especially since they're engaged and planning to merge their lives. The fact that she's considering ending the engagement shows how serious she takes this issue.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual decision-making are key. Even if the author has the legal right to use the bonus, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that big financial commitments should be discussed. The author didn't consult her, leading to a breakdown in communication. The construction making the house uninhabitable adds practical problems on top of the emotional strain.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspects suggest that they might have overstepped by not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is valid because financial decisions in a committed relationship often require partnership. The author's insistence on proceeding without discussion could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns and future plans. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from a relational standpoint, even if legally they're justified.\n"
