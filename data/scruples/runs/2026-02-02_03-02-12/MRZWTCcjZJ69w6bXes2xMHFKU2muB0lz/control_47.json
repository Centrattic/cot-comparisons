Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took a bonus to build a secret room is in the wrong. The situation is between them and their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a bonus, which they consider \"found money.\" They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that the money could have been used for shared expenses like a wedding or paying off debts. The author owns the house outright, so legally they can make modifications. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and the impact on the relationship. Even though the author has the legal right to modify the house, the main issue seems to be the lack of discussion with their fianc\u00e9. The bonus might be a windfall, but in a committed relationship, major financial decisions should involve both partners, especially when it affects their shared life (like remodeling the house they live in). \n\nThe author's argument is that the bonus was a one-time thing and they wanted to have fun with it. However, the fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid\u2014using that money for debt or wedding costs could alleviate financial stress. The conflict escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement. This suggests that the author didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared responsibilities of being engaged.\n\nEven though the author has the legal right to the house, the emotional and financial impact on the relationship is significant. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 can't live in the house during the renovations adds another layer of stress. The author may not have realized how important financial collaboration is in a relationship, which could indeed make them the asshole for not discussing the plan beforehand and dismissing their partner's concerns.\n"
