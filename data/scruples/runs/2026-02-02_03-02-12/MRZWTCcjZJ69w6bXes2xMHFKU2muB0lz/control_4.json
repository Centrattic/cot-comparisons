Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of work for years. They wanted to build a secret room, hired a contractor, started construction, and now the fianc\u00e9 is upset. The main issues here are financial responsibility and communication between partners.\n\nThe author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to use it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying debt, reducing wedding costs, or saving. She's moved in with her sister and considering ending the engagement.\n\nOwnership of the house is a factor here. The author owns the house outright, so legally, they can make modifications. But the relationship aspect complicates things. Even though it's their house, the fianc\u00e9 is affected by the changes and the financial decision.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are about communication and shared financial planning. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a significant financial decision that impacts both of them. Even though the bonus is personal income, major financial choices in a relationship should involve discussion. The author's actions led to a breakdown in the relationship, which is a big consequence.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they had the right to use their bonus as they saw fit. However, in a committed relationship, especially when engaged, expectations around shared finances and major projects likely exist. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and priorities, leading to conflict.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is intense, but it's also valid if they feel disrespected or that their concerns weren't considered. The author's decision to proceed without discussion could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author owns the house, the relationship aspect requires mutual respect and agreement on significant decisions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because they didn't communicate the decision to use the bonus for the project with their fianc\u00e9, leading to a major conflict. The financial responsibility argument is debatable, but the lack of communication is a key factor here.\n"
