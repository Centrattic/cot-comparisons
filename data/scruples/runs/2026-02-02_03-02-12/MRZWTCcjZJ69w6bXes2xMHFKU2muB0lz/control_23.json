Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the author used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a big argument with their fianc\u00e9. The key points here are about responsibility, communication, and the impact on their relationship.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted to build a secret room, which they saw as a fun project. They own the house outright since it was given by their grandma, so legally they can do what they want with it. But their fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the bonus should have been used for more responsible things like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. She's even considering breaking off the wedding because of this.\n\nNow, the author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to enjoy it while they could. The fianc\u00e9 feels like this was a big decision that should have been discussed together, especially since they're getting married. The fact that the author went ahead with the project without consulting her might be the main issue here. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations can affect the whole household, especially when they involve structural changes and cause disruption. Plus, the fianc\u00e9 is now unable to live in the house, which is a serious problem.\n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement, even if one person is handling the money. Since they're engaged, it's reasonable to expect that major expenses would be discussed. The author might have acted impulsively without considering how it would impact the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's anger could be justified because the decision not only affects their joint financial planning but also their living situation. The fact that she moved out and is considering ending the engagement shows how severe the conflict is.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they had the right to use their bonus as they saw fit. But in a committed relationship, especially one leading to marriage, shared financial decisions are important. The author's actions could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns, leading to the escalation of the conflict. The secret room idea, while a personal dream, might not be worth the strain it's putting on the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the main issue is lack of communication and consideration for the partner's perspective. Even though the author had the legal right to make the changes, the emotional and relational impact is significant. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing such a major financial decision with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding.\n"
