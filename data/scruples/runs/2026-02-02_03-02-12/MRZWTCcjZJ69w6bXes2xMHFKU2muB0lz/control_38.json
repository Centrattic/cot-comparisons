Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They used this bonus to start a project to build a secret room, which involves significant construction. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they're now considering breaking off the engagement. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again and that they own the house outright.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility, communication in a relationship, and respecting each other's priorities. The author's defense is that the bonus was unexpected and they own the house, so they have the right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a poor use of money, especially since they're planning to get married and there are other financial goals like paying off debt or helping with the wedding.\n\nI need to consider whether the author is entitled to spend their bonus as they wish, even if it causes conflict. On one hand, bonuses are typically considered personal income, and if the author is the sole owner of the house, they can make modifications. However, in a committed relationship, especially when planning to marry, major financial decisions might require discussion. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for shared goals like the wedding or debts could be valid. The construction also affects the living situation, making the house uncomfortable for the fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as not considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective, especially since the project is causing them to move out. The fact that the bonus is a one-time thing is a point for the author, but the fianc\u00e9's argument about shared financial planning is also important. The key here is whether the author should have discussed the use of the bonus with the fianc\u00e9 beforehand. If they didn't communicate and went ahead without considering the partner's needs, that could be the issue. Even though the author legally has the right to modify the house, the relationship aspect complicates things. The fianc\u00e9 feels disrespected, which is a significant emotional factor. \n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, major purchases or projects that affect shared living spaces should be discussed with the partner. The author might have acted unilaterally, not considering the partner's feelings and the relationship's dynamics. While the bonus is their income, using it in a way that creates such a rift might be seen as not being considerate. So, the answer would hinge on whether the author failed to communicate and consider their partner's valid concerns, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not discussing the plan with their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, even if they had the legal right to do the project.\n"
