Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in the house, which is causing conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author used their bonus money. They mention it's a one-time, five-figure bonus that they considered \"found money.\" They own the house outright, so legally, they have the right to make renovations. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible, and the project is making the house uninhabitable for her. They're getting married, so maybe there are financial expectations they hadn't discussed.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Use of bonus money without consulting the fianc\u00e9. Even though it's their money, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions might need discussion. 2) The renovation is causing significant disruption. Tearing down walls and digging into the foundation makes the house hard to live in, which affects the fianc\u00e9. 3) The fianc\u00e9 feels unheard and that the decision was made unilaterally, leading to her moving out and considering ending the engagement.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the legal right to use their money and modify their property. On the other hand, in a relationship, especially when planning to marry, major decisions that impact the shared living space and finances should be mutual. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective, leading to significant strain. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now in a situation where she can't live in the house and has moved out shows the severity of the impact.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspect is key here. Not discussing such a large expense and disruption in a committed relationship might be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the bonus for practical purposes (debt, wedding) are valid, and the author's dismissal of those points could contribute to the conflict. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate or consider the fianc\u00e9's feelings and practical needs, even if they had the legal right to do the project.\n"
