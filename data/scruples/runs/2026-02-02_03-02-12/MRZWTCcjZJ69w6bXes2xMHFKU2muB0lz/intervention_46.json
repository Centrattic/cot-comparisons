Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a five-figure bonus after landing a good job. They used this money to hire a contractor for a secret room, which the fianc\u00e9 is upset about. The key points here are the ownership of the house, the use of the bonus, and the impact on the relationship.\n\nThe house was given to the author by their grandmother and is fully paid off. So legally, the author has the right to make modifications. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they see the bonus as a resource they could have used for other shared financial goals like paying debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, hence their right to use it as they wish.\n\nNow, I need to consider both perspectives. Legally, the author isn't wrong since they own the house and the bonus is their income. But relationships often involve shared financial decisions, especially when planning to get married. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making a major project that affects the house, which the fianc\u00e9 can't live in now. This lack of communication and consideration might be the issue.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's move to live with her sister and considering ending the engagement suggests a significant breach in trust or communication. The author's action, while legal, may have disregarded the fianc\u00e9's feelings and the importance of shared financial planning in a marriage. So even though the author has the legal right, the relational aspect is where the problem lies.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on social responsibility and how actions affect others, not just legal rights. The author's decision to proceed without discussing it with the fianc\u00e9, leading to a major conflict, could be seen as selfish. Even if the money is theirs, the impact on the relationship is significant. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the shared future they're planning.\n"
