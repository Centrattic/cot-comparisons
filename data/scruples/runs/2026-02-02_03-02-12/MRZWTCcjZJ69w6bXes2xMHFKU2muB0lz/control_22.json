Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author got a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a while. They wanted to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright since it was their grandma's. They hired a contractor to do some major renovations, including tearing down walls and digging into the foundation. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's irresponsible to use the bonus this way instead of paying off debt, helping with the wedding costs, or saving. She's moved in with her sister and considering breaking off the engagement. The author argues that the bonus is \"found money\" and that it's their house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ownership. The house is legally owned by the author, so they have the right to make changes. However, they're engaged, which introduces shared expectations. Even though they're not married yet, fianc\u00e9es often plan to merge finances. The author might not have discussed the bonus usage beforehand, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe bonus is a windfall, but the fianc\u00e9e sees it as part of their shared future finances since they're engaged. The author's decision to spend it on a personal project without consulting her could be seen as dismissive of her priorities. The renovations causing the house to be uninhabitable for her adds to the stress, making it more than just a financial issue\u2014it's affecting their daily life and the relationship.\n\nWhile the author has legal rights over the house, relationships require communication and mutual respect. The key issue here is whether they discussed the bonus plan before spending it. If not, it's a failure to consider each other's needs. Even if the author feels it's their money, the engagement implies shared planning. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt and wedding costs are valid, especially if they have financial obligations together.\n\nThe author's justification of \"found money\" might not resonate if the fianc\u00e9e views it as part of their combined resources. The fact that the project is causing such a conflict suggests that the author didn't consider her feelings or the practical impact. The reaction of the fianc\u00e9e moving out and considering ending the engagement indicates a serious breach in trust and communication.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspects make them at fault. They should have discussed major financial decisions with their fianc\u00e9e, especially when it affects shared living conditions and future plans. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's concerns caused significant harm to the relationship.\n"
