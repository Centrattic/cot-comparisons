Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author received a five-figure bonus after being unemployed for a few years. They wanted to build a secret room, hired a contractor, started renovations. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they might break up. The author argues it's their house, they own it outright, and the bonus is \"found money.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author has legal ownership of the house, so they can make modifications. However, they are engaged, so the fianc\u00e9's perspective matters. The bonus is a windfall, but the fianc\u00e9 feels it should have been used for shared goals like paying off debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author didn't discuss this project with the fianc\u00e9 beforehand, leading to significant stress and the fianc\u00e9 moving out.\n\nMarriage involves shared financial decisions. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations affecting the entire house (like tearing walls and digging foundations) impact both partners. The fianc\u00e9 feels excluded from the decision, which is a relationship issue. The argument isn't just about money but about communication and mutual respect. The author might be right in thinking they can use their bonus as they wish, but not considering their partner's feelings and the shared life they're building could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, while legally the author isn't wrong, in a relationship context, not discussing major expenditures with a fianc\u00e9 is a mistake. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid because financial decisions in a committed partnership should be mutual. The author's actions caused significant distress, which is a red flag. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and consider their partner's perspective.\n"
