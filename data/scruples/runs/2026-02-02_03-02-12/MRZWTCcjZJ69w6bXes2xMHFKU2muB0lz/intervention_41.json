Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a big conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a bonus after landing a good job, which they considered \"found money.\" They used it to hire a contractor to build a secret room in the house they own. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks it's irresponsible, suggesting they could have used the money for other purposes like paying debt, wedding expenses, or saving. The project has made the house hard to live in, and she's even moved in with her sister, leading to possible breakup.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the bonus was unexpected and a one-time opportunity, so they wanted to enjoy it. They own the house outright, so they had legal rights to modify it. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without discussion, which is a key part of being in a committed relationship, especially with a wedding coming up. The fact that the project disrupted their living situation and caused such a rift is a big issue.\n\nThe main points to consider: 1) Use of bonus money without prior agreement. 2) Impact on the relationship and wedding plans. 3) Legal ownership vs. shared responsibility in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, especially when planning a future together, big financial decisions often require mutual agreement. The author might have thought they had the right to spend the bonus as they wished, but the fianc\u00e9 feels that major expenditures, especially ones that affect the home they're planning to live in together, should be discussed. The fact that the project has made the house uninhabitable adds to the problem, as it's affecting their daily life.\n\nEven though the author owns the house legally, in a relationship, there's often an expectation of shared decision-making, especially when the other partner is affected. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about debt and wedding costs might be valid because they could have shared financial goals. The author using the bonus without consulting might have ignored her priorities, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a legal sense, in terms of relationship responsibilities and communication, it's likely they are at fault. The key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the other partner's feelings and financial plans. The answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they made a unilateral decision that significantly impacted the relationship without discussion.\n"
