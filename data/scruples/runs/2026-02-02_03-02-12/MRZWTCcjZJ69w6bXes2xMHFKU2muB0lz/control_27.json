Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 who used a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author got a job, received a bonus, and decided to use it for a personal project. The partner is upset because the bonus could have been used for shared goals like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. The author argues it was \"found money\" and their house, so they had the right to spend it. The partner is so upset that she moved out and might end the engagement.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The bonus is technically the author's money, so they have the right to spend it. However, they are engaged, which implies a shared life and financial planning. Major projects affecting the home should ideally be discussed with a partner, even if it's their own property. The author didn't consult, which could be a mistake. The partner's concerns about financial responsibility and shared goals are valid. While the author has the legal right to use their money, the emotional impact and lack of communication might make them at fault in the relationship context.\n\nBut the author might argue they had the right to use their bonus as they wish. However, in a committed relationship, major decisions that affect both partners, especially ones that alter the home structure and cause stress, should be mutual. The fact that the partner is considering ending the relationship suggests that the author's actions were dismissive of the partner's financial priorities and emotional needs. Even if the money is their own, the way the decision was made without discussion could be seen as inconsiderate. So, while not legally wrong, socially or relationally, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the partner's perspective and the impact on their shared future plans.\n"
