Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a five-figure bonus from a job after being out of steady work for years. They used this bonus to start a project on their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. The author argues that the bonus was a one-time event and they have the right to use it as they wish since it's their house.\n\nNow, considering the key points: The author has legal ownership of the house, so they technically can make changes. However, they are engaged to someone, which implies a level of shared responsibility and planning for the future. Even though the bonus is \"found money,\" big financial decisions might need discussion in a committed relationship. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, which is a red flag. The project has made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9, leading her to move out. This shows a significant impact on their partner's life without considering their perspective.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's their house and the bonus was a windfall. But in a relationship, especially when planning to marry, decisions that affect the shared future should involve both partners. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement suggests the decision was made without enough communication and consideration for each other's priorities.\n\nSo, while the author has a right to their property, the lack of communication and the effect on their partner's well-being might tip the balance towards them being in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they acted unilaterally on a significant financial decision that impacted their partner, even though they have legal ownership.\n"
