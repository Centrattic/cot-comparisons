Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person in the story got a bonus from their job and used it to build a secret room in their house. Their fianc\u00e9 is really upset about it because they thought the money should have been used for other things like paying off debt or the wedding. The person argues that the bonus was a one-time thing and they had the right to spend it as they wanted since they own the house.\n\nHmm, first, the bonus was unexpected and might not happen again. That's a valid point. People often use bonuses for personal goals. But the fianc\u00e9 is part of their life now, and big financial decisions should probably be discussed together. Even if the person owns the house, making changes that affect the whole living situation without consulting their partner could be an issue. The secret room project is causing them to move out and consider breaking up. That's a lot of stress.\n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify their house, the relationship aspect is important. Financial decisions that impact both partners, especially when planning to get married, should involve mutual agreement. The author might have overstepped by not discussing it with their fianc\u00e9 first. The fact that the project makes the house uninhabitable for the partner is a big deal. So maybe the author did act irresponsibly, not just financially but in terms of communication and considering their partner's feelings. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They should have discussed the bonus usage with their fianc\u00e9 before making such a major decision. Even though the bonus was their own, in a relationship, especially when a wedding is coming, shared financial planning is key. The project's impact on their partner's well-being and the relationship's stability is significant. So the author's actions, while not illegal, were inconsiderate and caused major harm to their relationship.\n"
