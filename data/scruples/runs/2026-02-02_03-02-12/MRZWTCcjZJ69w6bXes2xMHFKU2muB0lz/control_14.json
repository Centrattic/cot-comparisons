Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They wanted a secret room, hired a contractor, and started modifying the house. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and they should have used the money for other purposes like debt, wedding costs, or savings. The author argues the bonus is \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to spend it as they wish. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved in with her sister and might end the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author's point is that it's their money from a one-time bonus and their property, so they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9's point is that they're planning to get married, so major financial decisions should be discussed together. \n\nLegal ownership of the house is with the author, but since they're engaged, there's a social expectation of shared financial planning. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big project, which could affect their living situation. The fianc\u00e9's parents might be helping with the wedding, and the author's decision might add financial strain. \n\nThe secret room project is altering the house significantly, making it hard for the fianc\u00e9 to live there. That's a practical issue. Even if the author owns the house, such a major renovation without discussing with a partner who's involved in the future of the home could be seen as dismissive of their concerns. \n\nThe bonus is a windfall, but using it for a personal project without considering the partner's input might be seen as selfish, especially in a committed relationship where shared financial goals are important. The author might be right about the legal aspect, but the social and relational aspects are where the conflict arises. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but her concerns about financial responsibility and shared planning are valid. The author didn't consider her perspective, leading to a breakdown in communication and trust. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. While the author has legal rights, in a relationship context, not discussing major financial decisions with the partner can be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might lean towards AITA (Author at Fault) because of the lack of communication despite the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns.\n"
