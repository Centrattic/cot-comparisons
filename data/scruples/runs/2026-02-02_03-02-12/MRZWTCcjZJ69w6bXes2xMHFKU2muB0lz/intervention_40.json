Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person got a bonus and used it to create a secret room in their house. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset and might call off the wedding because of this.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were unemployed for several years and then got a good job with a big bonus. The bonus was five figures, which is a lot of money. They used it to hire a contractor to build a secret room in their house, which they own outright since it was their grandma's and given to them. \n\nThe key points here are: the author owns the house, so they have legal authority to make changes. The bonus was unexpected and might not come again, so they saw it as a chance to do something fun. However, the project is causing problems for their fianc\u00e9. She's upset because they could have used the money for other things like paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. She also can't live in the house because of the construction, leading to her moving in with her sister. \n\nSo, the main conflict is financial and relational. The author believes it's their money to spend as they wish since they own the house. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that major decisions should be discussed together, especially since they're planning to get married. \n\nNow, considering responsibilities in a relationship, especially when you're engaged. Even though the author has legal rights, relationships often require mutual decision-making, especially for significant expenses that affect shared living spaces. The secret room project is causing immediate disruption (construction making the house uninhabitable) and financial strain. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for practical purposes might be valid, especially if there are debts or upcoming wedding costs. \n\nThe author might think it's their own money, but since they're engaged, it's a shared future. Big financial decisions without consultation can hurt the partner's feelings and create trust issues. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement shows how serious this is. \n\nOn the other hand, the bonus was a one-time event, and the author might see it as a windfall to spend on a personal dream. But the impact on the relationship is significant. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and needs, which is a problem in communication and partnership. \n\nSo, even though legally the author can make the changes, in a relationship context, not discussing major financial decisions with their partner could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the fianc\u00e9's feelings and the shared future they're building together.\n"
