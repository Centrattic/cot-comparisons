Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a major argument with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a bonus after finding a good job, which is more than just a regular salary. They used this bonus to build a secret room. They own the house outright, so legally, they have the right to make modifications. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible, especially since they could have used the money for debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, so they should enjoy it. Now the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the wedding, and they're at a point where she's moved out.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are financial responsibility and relationship communication. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big decision. Even though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is part of the life partnership. Making a major project that affects the entire house without discussing it with their partner could be seen as selfish. The fact that the project is causing them to consider ending their engagement is a big deal.\n\nOn the other hand, the bonus is the author's money, and they might feel they have the right to spend it as they wish. Plus, the house is their own property. But the problem here isn't just the spending; it's the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and their shared future. In a relationship, especially when planning to get married, big financial decisions should be discussed together. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but in terms of relationship dynamics, they probably should have talked it over first.\n\nSo, while the author's actions might be understandable from a personal desire perspective, the main issue is the lack of communication, which is a common problem in relationships. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial responsibility and shared planning are valid. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's perspective and the impact on their relationship.\n"
