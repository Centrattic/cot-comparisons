Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they used a bonus to create a secret room, which upset their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the person got a job and received a bonus after being out of work for a while. They used this bonus for a personal project they've always wanted\u2014a secret room. They own the house outright, so they have legal rights to modify it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they feel the bonus should have been used for more practical things like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. The fianc\u00e9 is now considering breaking off the engagement because of this.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author argues that the bonus was \"found money\" and a one-time thing, so they wanted to enjoy it. The fianc\u00e9 feels that since they're getting married, such decisions should be discussed and agreed upon together. \n\nEven though the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9 is involved in the situation because they're engaged. Major financial decisions affecting their shared home might require mutual agreement, especially when it impacts the structure of the house and their living situation. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before proceeding, which led to significant strain. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as selfish because they went ahead with a big project without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective. Even if the money was their own, the decision affects their partner's life and the future of their marriage. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about using the money for practical purposes are valid, especially if they have financial goals together. \n\nSo, while the author has the legal right to modify the house, the relationship aspect is where the issue lies. Not discussing such a significant financial decision with a partner, especially one's fianc\u00e9, can be seen as a breach of trust and responsibility in the relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's feelings and priorities, leading to a major conflict.\n"
