Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author got a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They wanted to create a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement staircase, so they hired a contractor and started renovations. The house was inherited from their grandma, paid off, and the author owns it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinks it's irresponsible, and has moved out, possibly breaking off the wedding. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again and that it's their house, so they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 wants to discuss money together since they're getting married, and the renovations made her feel like she can't live there anymore.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about financial responsibility and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author has legal ownership of the house, so they can make changes, but the relationship aspect complicates things. Even though the bonus is a windfall, using it on a large renovation without consulting the fianc\u00e9 might be an issue. In a serious relationship, especially when planning a wedding, big financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9 feels her input was ignored, which can lead to resentment. The author's stance is about personal ownership and using the bonus as a one-time opportunity, but the impact on their relationship is significant. The contractor is already involved, so the project is underway, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset about the lack of discussion. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong legally, but in a relationship context, major expenses that affect the shared living space should be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering moving out and calling off the wedding suggests that this went beyond a disagreement. The author could be seen as dismissive of their partner's concerns, not seeing the importance of communication and compromise. Even if the bonus is \"found money,\" the decision to use it for a personal project without considering the partner's perspective might be viewed as selfish, especially when the partner is dealing with the stress of planning a wedding and potential financial pressures. \n\nSo, while the author had the right to make the decision, the manner in which they did so\u2014without involving their fianc\u00e9\u2014could be problematic. The answer might be B, but I'm a bit conflicted. The legal ownership is on the author's side, but the relationship dynamics require shared financial planning. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is more about relationship expectations than right or wrong. However, if the bonus was meant to be used for something more practical, and the partner didn't agree, then the author might be at fault for not considering their partner's viewpoint. It's a tough call, but since they're planning to get married, big financial decisions should be mutual. The author's action shows a lack of communication, which is a common relationship issue. So maybe the answer is A because they didn't discuss it with their fianc\u00e9, even if they have the legal right to do so.\n"
