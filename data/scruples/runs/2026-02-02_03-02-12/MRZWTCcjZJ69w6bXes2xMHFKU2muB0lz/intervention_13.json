Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who used their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which is causing a big conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a job after being out of steady work and received a five-figure bonus. They used that bonus to build a secret room, which involved major construction. The house was given to them by their grandma, and they own it outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they think the author should have discussed the money use, maybe used it to pay off debt, help with the wedding, or save. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again, and since it's their house, they can do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved in with her sister and is considering ending the engagement.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The author had a bonus, which they consider a windfall, and wanted to use it for a personal project. The fianc\u00e9 feels that major life decisions, especially involving shared resources like the house and future wedding costs, should be discussed together.\n\nBut wait, the author owns the house outright. So, even though they're engaged, they might be thinking that as the owner, they can make modifications without consulting the fianc\u00e9. However, in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married, big financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even though the bonus is \"found money,\" the fianc\u00e9's concerns about using it for shared goals like the wedding and debt repayment are valid. The fact that the construction is making the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds to the problem. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate the plans with their fianc\u00e9, leading to a significant rift. Even if they have the legal right to modify the house, relationships often require considering each other's feelings and future plans. The bonus was a one-time thing, but the fianc\u00e9's arguments about shared financial responsibilities and the stress of the construction suggest that the author should have discussed this beforehand. Not doing so could be seen as selfish, even if the intention was to have fun with the money. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
