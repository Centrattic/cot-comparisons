Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, which has caused a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author received a five-figure bonus after being out of steady work for years. They decided to use it for a personal project, a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement. The house is owned outright by the author, given by their grandma. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, feeling the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, the wedding, or saving. She's moved in with her sister and considering calling off the wedding.\n\nSo, the key points here are ownership of the house, the use of the bonus (which the author calls \"found money\"), and the fianc\u00e9e's reaction. The author argues it's their house and the bonus was a one-time thing. The fianc\u00e9e feels it's irresponsible and that joint decisions should be made as they're getting married.\n\nLegally, since the author owns the house, they have the right to make changes. However, in a committed relationship, especially a fianc\u00e9e, financial decisions might be expected to be discussed. The bonus isn't income but a reward, so the author's perspective that it's a one-time windfall makes sense. But the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about financial planning for marriage are valid too. \n\nThe conflict seems to stem from differing values: immediate personal fulfillment vs. long-term financial planning. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9e, which is a relationship issue. Even though legally they can do as they please, relationships require compromise. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is considering ending the engagement because of this suggests the decision had significant relational consequences. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, in the context of a relationship, not discussing major financial decisions that affect the household (like altering the house and using a bonus that could be pooled for shared goals) might make them at fault relationally. The contractor work causing her to leave the house adds practical stress. Therefore, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not considering the fianc\u00e9e's concerns and the shared future they're planning.\n"
