Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). So, I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a moderator using a throwaway account, which is common in AITA stories to avoid exposure. They landed a good job after years out of work, got a five-figure bonus, and decided to use it to create a secret room with a bookshelf door and a basement staircase. The house was inherited from the author's grandma, who paid it off, so they own it outright and have legal authority. The fianc\u00e9 is furious, thinking it's irresponsible to use the bonus instead of paying off debt, helping with the wedding, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want. The fianc\u00e9 is so upset she moved in with her sister and considers ending the 2-year engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since the author owns the house outright, they can make modifications. But the fianc\u00e9 is living there with them, so maybe there's an unspoken expectation of shared decision-making? The bonus is the author's personal money, but fianc\u00e9s often plan to merge finances, especially when discussing big life events like a wedding. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a big change, which could be a point of contention. The fianc\u00e9 felt it was irresponsible, perhaps because they were expecting to use that money for other shared goals. The author's actions might have gone against the fianc\u00e9's expectations, leading to conflict. Even though the author has the right to the money and the house, relationships often require communication and compromise. Not discussing a significant project that affects the shared living space could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is now considering ending the engagement suggests the issue is deeper than just the money or the renovation. The author's decision might have been a trigger for existing tensions about financial responsibilities in the marriage. The bonus being a one-time thing is a valid point, but the fianc\u00e9's perspective is about planning for the future and shared obligations. In many relationships, major financial decisions are discussed together, even if the money is one person's. The author's unilateral action could be perceived as not valuing the fianc\u00e9's input. However, the author might not have considered that the fianc\u00e9 would view it as a shared goal. The key factors are communication, shared expectations, and the impact on the relationship. Without knowing more about their prior agreements or discussions, it's hard to say definitively. But in the context of a fianc\u00e9 relationship, especially when planning a wedding and considering debts, not discussing a large expense might be seen as inconsiderate. The author's insistence that it's their house could be valid, but the fianc\u00e9's ability to live there is affected, so that's a shared issue. The contractor work causing disruption is a practical problem that was unaddressed, leading to the fianc\u00e9 moving out. So, while the author isn't legally wrong, the social and relational aspects might mean they are at fault. The answer would likely be A (yes), as the author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective and the impact on their relationship, even if the financial decision is their own. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is extreme, but the author's lack of communication is a key issue.\n"
