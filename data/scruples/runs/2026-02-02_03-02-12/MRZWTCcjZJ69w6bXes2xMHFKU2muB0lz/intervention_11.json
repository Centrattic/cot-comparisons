Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author received a five-figure bonus from a job after being unemployed for some time. They used this money to build a secret room, which required significant construction. The house is owned outright by the author, as it was inherited from their grandma. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible and that the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The argument escalated to the point where the fianc\u00e9 is considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. Legally, the author owns the house and has the right to modify it. The bonus is their personal income, so they have the right to spend it as they see fit. However, the relationship aspect is important. The author made a major financial decision without discussing it with their fianc\u00e9, which is a significant issue in a committed relationship, especially when planning to get married. Even though the money is theirs, major expenditures can affect both partners, especially if they're pooling resources or have shared financial goals.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is that this was an irresponsible use of funds when there were other pressing financial needs. The author's defense is that the bonus was unexpected and a one-time opportunity. But in a relationship, especially pre-marriage, financial decisions typically require discussion and mutual agreement. The fact that the construction made the house uninhabitable for the fianc\u00e9 adds another layer of conflict, as it affects their living conditions.\n\nSo, while the author isn't legally in the wrong, the social and relational expectations might place some responsibility on them for not consulting their partner before making such a significant decision. Relationships often require compromise and communication, and making a large, unilateral decision that affects both partners can be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's technically their money and property.\n\nTherefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong not because of legal issues, but due to the lack of communication and consideration for their partner's feelings and the shared future plans. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, while extreme, is understandable given the circumstances of a pre-marital financial decision affecting their joint life plans.\n"
