Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a major conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after a long period of unemployment. They used it to build a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is fully owned by the author, so they have legal right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she feels the money could have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt or wedding expenses. She's even moved in with her sister and might call off the wedding.\n\nThe author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" and they wanted to enjoy it while they could. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's irresponsible and that there should have been a discussion. The key points here are communication and mutual decision-making in a relationship. Even though the author owns the house, major projects that affect the whole household, especially with a fianc\u00e9, should probably be discussed. The fact that the author went ahead without consulting her might be the issue. The contractor work making the house uninhabitable for her adds to her frustration.\n\nSo, while the author technically has the right to modify their property, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9's concerns could make them at fault. Relationships require compromise and shared financial decisions. The author's actions might be seen as self-centered, even if the bonus is their own money. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because they are planning to get married, so financial decisions should be joint. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve their partner in the decision, leading to significant conflict.\n"
