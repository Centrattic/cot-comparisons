Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using a bonus to create a secret room in their house, which caused a major conflict with the fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author got a five-figure bonus after a long period without steady work. They used it for a personal project\u2014a secret room with a bookshelf door. The house is inherited from the author's grandma and is fully paid off. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, thinking it's irresponsible, and they might break up over it.\n\nSo, the key points: The author used their own money (bonus) on a project they wanted. They own the house. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a shared responsibility and that the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding. The author argues it's their house and the bonus is \"found money.\"\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they did use the bonus without consulting the fianc\u00e9. Even though they own the house, a major renovation might affect both partners, especially if they're planning to get married. The fianc\u00e9's concerns about financial planning for marriage are valid. The author might have ignored the fianc\u00e9's input, leading to feelings of being left out of important decisions. Even if the author has legal authority, relationships require communication and mutual agreement on major expenses. So, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the plans with the fianc\u00e9 first. Answer A.\n"
