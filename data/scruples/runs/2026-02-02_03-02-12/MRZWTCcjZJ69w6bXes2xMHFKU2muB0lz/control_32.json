Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room in their house, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author received a one-time bonus after being unemployed for a while. They used this money for a personal project, a secret room with a bookshelf door. They own the house outright, so legally, they have the right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they wanted the money used for shared expenses like paying off debt, wedding costs, or saving. The author argues it's \"found money\" that might not come again and that it's their house.\n\nNow, considering the key points: legality is on the author's side, but the relationship aspect is more complex. The fianc\u00e9 feels the decision was made without discussion, which is a valid concern in a committed relationship. Financial decisions, especially large ones, usually require mutual agreement. Even though the bonus is the author's income, using it for a personal project when there are shared financial goals (like a wedding) can cause tension. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is considering ending the engagement suggests the issue goes beyond just money\u2014it's about communication and respect for each other's priorities.\n\nThe author's argument about using \"found money\" might hold some weight, but the execution\u2014starting major renovations without discussing\u2014definitely contributed to the problem. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that they should plan together for their future, and the author's unilateral decision undermines that. So while the author isn't legally wrong, ethically, they might be at fault for not involving their partner in the decision, especially in a long-term relationship where shared financial planning is expected.\n"
