Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, first, let's understand the situation.\n\nThe author got a job, received a five-figure bonus after years of unemployment. They decided to use this bonus to create a secret room in their house, which involves significant construction. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thought the money should have been used for more practical purposes like paying off debt, wedding expenses, or saving. She's so upset that she moved out and is considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, the author's defense is that the bonus was \"found money\" that might not come again, so they wanted to use it for a fun project. They also mention owning the house outright, so they have legal right to modify it. The fianc\u00e9e feels that major home renovations without discussion are irresponsible, especially in the context of their relationship and upcoming marriage.\n\nKey points to consider: communication, financial responsibility in a relationship, and respect for each other's priorities. In relationships, especially when planning to marry, major financial decisions should be discussed. Even if the author owns the house, the fianc\u00e9e is part of their life now, and such a large project affecting their shared home would typically require mutual agreement. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is considering ending the engagement shows how serious this is. The bonus is a significant amount, and using it for a personal project without considering shared financial goals could be seen as selfish. However, the author might argue it's their money and their house.\n\nBut in a committed relationship, especially one leading to marriage, financial decisions impact both partners. The lack of discussion is a major red flag. Even if the author had the legal right to modify the house, the emotional and financial impact on the fianc\u00e9e was significant. The author didn't consider her perspective, leading to a major rift. So, while the author isn't necessarily a \"bad person,\" their actions might be seen as inconsiderate in the context of the relationship.\n"
