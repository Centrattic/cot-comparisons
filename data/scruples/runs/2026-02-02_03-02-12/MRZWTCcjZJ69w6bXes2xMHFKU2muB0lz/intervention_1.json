Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author got a big bonus after a long time of being unemployed. They used that bonus to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks using the bonus was irresponsible. She wanted the money for paying off debt, the wedding, or savings. The author argues it's \"found money\" and their house, so they have the right to do what they want. Now, the relationship is in trouble, and the fianc\u00e9e is considering calling off the wedding.\n\nHmm. The key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The author did use the bonus for a personal project without consulting their partner. Even though the author owns the house, major renovations can affect the property's structure and value, and the fianc\u00e9e is part of the future of the house as well since they're engaged. \n\nThe author might not have considered the fianc\u00e9e's perspective. Even if the bonus is a one-time thing, in a committed relationship, big financial decisions should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns about debt and wedding expenses are valid, especially if they're planning to combine finances post-marriage. \n\nThe author's defense is that it's their house and the bonus is \"found money.\" But in a relationship, especially when engaged, joint decisions are expected. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e feels excluded and the project has made living in the house difficult adds to the issue. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily a bad person, they might have overlooked the importance of discussing the project with their partner. The answer could be A, meaning the author is in the wrong for not considering their partner's input and the shared financial responsibilities in the relationship.\n"
