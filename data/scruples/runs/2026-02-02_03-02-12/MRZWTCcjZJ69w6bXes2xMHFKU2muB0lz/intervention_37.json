Thank you for taking the time to weigh in on what was supposed to be a fun project but has turned into a major issue between my fianc\u00e9 and I. I am a moderator on several other subs so I am using a throwaway so as to not cross the streams so to speak. \n\nLast year, after several years of being out of steady work, I was able to land a really good job. My new company had an unreasonably good year and in late February I got a five figure bonus. I have always wanted a \"secret\" room in my house, I honestly don't know why but it's just always seemed so cool to have a room where I pull a lever, a bookcase opens to my private space. I figured with the bonus the time was right so I hired a good contractor, they tore down some walls and started digging up the foundation to our spare bedroom since the secret room will have a circular staircase to a new basement. The house was my grandma's and was given to me paid off when she died so I own the house outright and have full legal authority to do this. \n\nFiance is so furious at me she's thinking about calling off the wedding. She says that taking my bonus was wildly irresponsible and that we could have used the money to pay off debt, pay for some of the wedding to take pressure of her parents or even save. I counter with this bonus was essentially \"found\" money that may never happen again so we might have fun with it while we have it. She says that we are getting married, this has to be a discussion and me digging up the foundation and tearing out several walls in the house has made it impossible for her to live in the house. I counter again that its my house. The argument has gotten so intense that she has moved in with her sister and we may be looking at the end of our 2 year relationship. \n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for using their bonus to create a secret room, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author received a bonus from a new job, which they describe as \"found money\" that might not happen again. They used it to create a secret room in their house, which they own outright. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because she thinks the money could have been used for other purposes like paying off debt or the wedding, and the construction is making living in the house difficult. The author argues it's their house and they had the right to spend the bonus as they wanted.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships and financial decisions. Even though the author has legal ownership of the house, this is a serious project that affects both partners, especially since they are engaged. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9 before making such a significant and disruptive decision. The bonus is their income, but in a committed relationship, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is so upset that she's considering calling off the wedding suggests that communication and mutual respect were lacking here. The author might have prioritized their personal desire without considering the fianc\u00e9's concerns and the shared future they're building together. \n\nEven though the bonus wasn't part of their regular income, using it for a large project without discussing it with the partner is a common point of contention in AITA scenarios. The construction disrupting their living situation adds to the problem. The author's stance that it's \"their house\" overlooks the fact that in a relationship, especially a long-term one like this, such decisions should involve both people. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily at fault for the bonus being a personal windfall, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings is a mistake. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here because they didn't involve their fianc\u00e9 in the decision-making process, leading to significant conflict.\n"
