I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, while working at Target, helped a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating of GTA V, including graphic content, and convinced the mother not to buy it. The co-worker was upset about this, and the author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game in question, GTA V, is rated M for Mature, which is intended for ages 17+. The author provided accurate information about the game's content, which is their job to do. The mother was seeking advice because she didn't know much about the game, and the author gave her the necessary details to make an informed decision. The mother then chose not to buy the game, which seems like a responsible decision for a 9-year-old.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction is interesting. He called it \"videogame cockblocking,\" which implies he thinks the author was overstepping. But the author's role is to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The author's intention was to help the mother make a safe choice for her child, not to be judgmental. The author also mentions that they would want the same level of information if they were buying for their own kids.\n\nFrom a legal and ethical standpoint, providing factual information about a product's content isn't wrong. The author didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they presented the facts, and the mother made the choice. The author's action aligns with the job responsibility to advise on product suitability, especially for minors. The co-worker's disapproval seems to stem from a different perspective, possibly valuing consumer choice more than child safety, but the author's concern is about protecting a child from inappropriate content.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted responsibly by providing necessary information to help the mother make an informed decision. The answer should be B.\n"
