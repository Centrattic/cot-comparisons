I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that the author works at Target and was helping a customer buy a video game. The mother wanted GTA V for her son, but the author explained the M rating and detailed the graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author, and now the author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were appropriate. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the author's role. The game is rated M (Mature) which typically means it's for ages 17+. GTA V is known for its mature themes, violence, and other content not suitable for children. The author provided the mother with accurate information about the game's content, which is part of their job to help customers make informed decisions. \n\nThe mother was concerned after being informed, so she chose not to buy it. The author's intention was to prevent a child from being exposed to inappropriate content. However, the co-worker's criticism suggests that some might see this as overstepping, even though the author was doing their job. \n\nBut in retail, employees are trained to inform customers about product details, including age ratings and content warnings. The author didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they provided information, which is the customer's right to know. The mother made the decision based on that information. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they were doing their job to ensure the customer was fully informed. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that they would want the same transparency for their own children if they had any is a valid point. It's about protecting children from inappropriate content. The co-worker's reaction might come from a different perspective, perhaps thinking that the parent should have the final say without interference, but in this case, the parent was seeking advice and the author provided it. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions were responsible and appropriate. They didn't act out of malice but to help the customer make a better decision. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
