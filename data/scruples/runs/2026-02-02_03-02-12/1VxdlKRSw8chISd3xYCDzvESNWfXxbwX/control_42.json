I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an employee at Target who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-workers reacted mixed, with one being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The employee provided information about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The employee's reasoning is that they were doing what they would want for their own kids if they were in the mother's position.\n\nThe key here is whether providing factual information about a product's content is inappropriate. Retail employees are often expected to help customers make informed decisions. GTA V does have an M rating, which is for mature audiences, and the employee explained the reasons behind that rating. The mother was seeking more info, so the employee answered her questions truthfully.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the employee overstepped by being too graphic. But the mother asked for more details, so the employee was just giving what she requested. The employee didn't force the mother to not buy the game; they provided information, and the mother made the decision herself.\n\nAnother angle is the co-worker's complaint about \"cockblocking.\" The co-worker was helping the mother, but the employee's intervention might have been seen as interfering. However, the employee's intent was to protect a child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern. \n\nAlso, the law and ethical guidelines in retail often encourage employees to inform customers about product content, especially for items that could be unsuitable for minors. The employee isn't wrong for ensuring the product is appropriate for the child's age. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the employee acted responsibly by providing necessary information, which allowed the parent to make an informed choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
