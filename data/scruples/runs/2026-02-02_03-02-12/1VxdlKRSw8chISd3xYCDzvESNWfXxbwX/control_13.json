I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for preventing a mother from buying Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV) for her 9-year-old. The author worked at Target and, when helping the mother, detailed the game's mature content, leading her to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" and now the author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both perspectives. The author's argument is that they were being responsible by informing the mother about the game's content, which is rated M for mature audiences. They mention graphic torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements, which are indeed part of GTAV. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase, so the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. From the author's point of view, they were doing a public service, ensuring that a parent made an informed decision in the best interest of their child.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker and some colleagues found this behavior intrusive. The co-worker called it \"videogame cockblocking,\" implying that the author overstepped their role. The co-worker's argument is that the author shouldn't have intervened so directly, perhaps seeing it as an unnecessary interference in the customer's choice. The mother might have had her reasons for wanting GTAV for her son, maybe peer pressure or the son's interest, and the author's actions could be seen as undermining the customer's autonomy.\n\nLegally, the author is within their rights to provide accurate information about the product. The game's M rating is a formal warning, and the author is merely reinforcing that by explaining the content. However, the ethical question is whether it's appropriate for an employee to influence a customer's purchasing decision so directly. In retail, employees are often encouraged to be helpful and honest about product details. However, there's a line between providing information and pushing a personal opinion.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. If the author had simply confirmed the M rating and left it at that, it might not be an issue. But by going into graphic details about the content, the author is taking an active role in dissuading the purchase. This could be seen as imposing their own values on the customer. The mother might have known the rating but decided it was appropriate for her child, or she might have had other considerations. By giving such detailed information, the author may have caused the mother to feel judged or pressured, leading to a loss of potential sales.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was protective. Parents often rely on accurate information from salespeople, especially when they're unsure about content. The mother was seeking more information, so the author's detailed response was in response to her request. The author's actions could be viewed as a responsible effort to help a parent make an informed decision, which is in the child's best interest. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a strong emphasis on parental responsibility and child safety. By providing the detailed content warnings, the author is acting in alignment with those values. On the other hand, there's a value placed on consumer choice and the freedom to make decisions without interference, even if those decisions might be controversial.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction might stem from a different perspective, perhaps viewing the situation as the author overstepping their role. Retail employees are typically there to assist, not to judge. The line between helpfulness and overstepping can be thin. If the author had just stated the M rating and offered to help find a different game if needed, that might be more neutral. But by actively discouraging the purchase with graphic details, the author took a more active stance.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the balance between providing necessary information and respecting the customer's autonomy. If the author stayed within their role as an informed assistant, providing the requested details, they might be justified. However, if they went beyond that by being overly critical or judgmental, they could be seen as overstepping. Given the context, the mother asked for more information after being told the M rating, so the author's detailed explanation was in response to a request. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong, as they were fulfilling the customer's request and acting in the child's best interest.\n"
