I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation. The person works at Target in electronics. A customer wants to buy GTAV for her 9-year-old. The employee explains the M rating, mentions graphic content like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decides against it. The co-worker called them \"cockblocking,\" leading to mixed reactions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the key points. The mother wanted the game for a very young kid. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, which typically means 17+. The employee provided detailed info about the content, which is within their job to do. The mother was concerned and chose a different game. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about not wanting to restrict others, but the employee's action was to protect a child from inappropriate content. \n\nThe employee's reasoning is that if they were in a similar situation, they'd want to know the details. It's a matter of responsible consumer advice. There's no indication that the employee forced the mother not to buy it; they just informed her. The ESRB ratings are meant to guide parents, and the employee is following that guidance. Co-workers' mixed reactions don't necessarily validate or condemn the action, but the main point is about protecting a child's well-being. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say it's up to the parent to decide, but the parent might not be aware of the content. The employee's intervention could prevent the parent from unknowingly exposing their child to inappropriate material. Since the child is under the recommended age, the employee's action is protective. \n\nTherefore, the employee isn't in the wrong. They acted responsibly by providing necessary information to help the parent make an informed decision. The co-worker's criticism is misplaced, as the employee did their job correctly.\n"
