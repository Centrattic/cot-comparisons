I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person works at Target in electronics and was helping a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which has an M rating. The author explained that the game has graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, intense swearing, and the online component. The mother then decided not to buy GTAV and picked a different game. The co-worker was upset, saying it was \"cockblocking\" the kid, and made a big deal in the break room. The author is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author's main argument is that they were providing accurate information about the game's content to help the parent make an informed decision. Parents often rely on store employees to give honest advice, especially since they might not know the details of the game. GTAV is known for its mature content, so the M rating is there for a reason. The author's actions could be seen as protective, wanting to prevent a child from being exposed to inappropriate material. \n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker's complaint is that the author was interfering with the child's request. But the child's age is 9, which is way below the recommended age for an M-rated game. The parent is the one making the purchase, so the author's responsibility is to the parent, not the child. The author isn't the parent, so it's not their job to decide what the child can play. However, providing factual information about the game's content is part of their job, especially when the parent is asking for more details.\n\nAnother angle is the employer's policies. Some stores have guidelines about employee involvement in customer decisions. If the store has a policy that employees should not discourage purchases unless there's a specific issue, then the author might be overstepping. But in this case, the author was simply informing about the content, which is part of customer service. The M rating is a standard system that the parent was already aware of, but the author provided more context. \n\nThe key here is whether the author crossed a line by actively persuading the mother not to buy the game. If the author had just stated the facts without adding their own opinion, it's different. But the author's description says they were persuading her, using examples of the graphic content. However, since the parent was concerned after hearing the details, maybe the author's intention was good. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, there's no law against giving truthful information about a product. The author isn't lying, so they can't be in the wrong for providing accurate details. The parent made the decision based on that information, which is their right. The co-worker's reaction might be more about not wanting to see a child's request denied, but the author isn't the parent. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help the parent make a responsible choice for their child. The parent should be the one to decide, and the author was just doing their job by being honest about the game's content. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced because the author was acting in the parent's best interest.\n"
