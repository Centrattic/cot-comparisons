I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author works at Target in electronics. They helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV). The author explained the M rating, the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy GTAV. However, the co-worker was upset, called the author a \"videogame cockblocker,\" and made a big deal about it in the break room with mixed reactions. The author is now unsure if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether it's appropriate for an employee to give detailed information about a game's content to help a parent make an informed decision. The author provided information that led the parent to choose a different game, which is in line with responsible parenting and age-appropriate content. However, the co-worker and others had mixed reactions, suggesting some might see it as overstepping.\n\nIn terms of company policy, I'm not sure if Target has specific guidelines about employees discussing game content. If they do, the author might be violating it, but if not, then it's more about personal judgment. The author's intention was to inform the parent, which is a positive action. Parents are expected to know what their kids are exposed to, and the author is helping them make a better decision. However, the co-worker's reaction might be based on the idea that the employee shouldn't make personal judgments about the parent's choice, even if it's for the child's benefit.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of the employee. Employees are often encouraged to provide accurate information about products. If the M rating is clear, maybe the author didn't need to go into graphic details. But the parent asked for more information, so the author was just answering the question. The parent then made an informed choice, which is a good outcome. The co-worker's frustration might stem from feeling that the author imposed their own values, but the author's rationale is about protecting the child from inappropriate content.\n\nI should also consider if there's a difference in perspective. The author believes they're doing the right thing by being thorough, while the co-worker sees it as interfering. The parent was grateful in the end, which supports the author's stance. The key here is whether the author overstepped by providing graphic details. If the parent asked for specifics, the author's job is to answer honestly. However, if the author volunteered that information without being asked, that might be different. In this case, the parent asked for more info, so the author was just clarifying.\n\nSo, based on this, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the parent requested to make an informed decision. The co-worker's reaction is just a differing opinion, but the action itself was appropriate.\n"
