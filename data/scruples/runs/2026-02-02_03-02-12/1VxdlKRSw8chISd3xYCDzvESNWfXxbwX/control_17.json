I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The OP works at Target and was helping a customer buy a video game. The customer's son is 9, and she wanted GTA V. The OP explained the M rating, mentioned graphic scenes like torture, sexual content, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker criticized the OP for \"cockblocking,\" and others had mixed reactions. OP is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nI need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. The main points are:\n\n1. **Age Appropriateness**: GTA V is rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, intended for ages 17+. The mother is buying for a 9-year-old, which is a significant age gap. The ESRB ratings are meant to guide parents about content suitability. The OP provided accurate info about the game's content, which is a public service. \n\n2. **Parental Responsibility**: The mother's role is to make informed decisions about what her child consumes. By giving her detailed info, the OP helped her make an educated choice. The mother might not have been aware of the specific content, so the OP's intervention could be seen as helpful.\n\n3. **Store Policy and Job Role**: The co-worker criticized the action. But in a retail setting, employees are often trained to inform customers about product content, especially for age-sensitive items like video games. If the store encourages following ESRB ratings, the OP might be doing their job correctly. However, if the store expects employees to not influence purchasing decisions beyond providing basic info, there might be a conflict. But the question doesn't mention store policy, so we can't assume that.\n\n4. **Intent and Impact**: The OP's intent was to help the mother make a decision in her child's best interest, not to be a \"dick.\" The outcome was positive\u2014the mother chose a different game. The co-worker's reaction seems based on a different perspective, possibly valuing the customer's right to choose without interference.\n\n5. **Potential Legal Issues**: There's no indication that the OP broke any laws. The First Amendment allows employees to express their views, and the mother is free to make her choice. The OP didn't prevent the sale; they provided information that led the mother to change her decision.\n\n6. **Ethical Considerations**: Protecting children from inappropriate content is generally seen as a positive action. The OP is acting as a gatekeeper, which is a common practice in retail for age-restricted items (like alcohol or tobacco). The mixed reactions from coworkers might reflect differing opinions but don't necessarily make the action wrong.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the employee overstepped by not just stating the rating but giving graphic details. However, the mother asked for more information, so the OP was answering her request. If the mother was seeking a game for a 9-year-old, the employee's detailed info could be seen as necessary to ensure the game is suitable.\n\nIn conclusion, the OP acted in a way that aligns with helping a parent make an informed decision, adhering to content ratings, and protecting a child from inappropriate material. Unless there's a specific store policy against it, the action seems justified. The co-worker's criticism is a personal opinion, but it doesn't make the OP wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
