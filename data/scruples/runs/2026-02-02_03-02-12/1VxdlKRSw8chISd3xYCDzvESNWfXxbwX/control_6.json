I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they work at Target in electronics, and a customer came in to buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The customer wanted to buy GTA V, which has an M rating (for mature audiences). The author explained the game's content, like graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by giving the mother accurate info to make a choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, stores can't sell certain rated content to minors. The M rating is supposed to guide parents, so the author was probably just informing the parent about the rating's reasons. The parent then made the decision not to buy it, which aligns with the rating's purpose. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by not just stating the rating but providing detailed graphic content. But the parent asked for more information, so the author answered truthfully. The parent's decision was based on that info, which is exactly what the M rating is for. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction might stem from thinking the child should have the game, but the author's stance is about protecting the child from inappropriate content. The author's reasoning is that they want to inform the parent as they would want to be informed if they were in a similar position. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the parent asked for, helping her make an informed decision. The M rating exists to prevent minors from accessing inappropriate content, and the author's actions support that. The co-worker's criticism is misplaced because the author didn't force the decision but gave facts. The answer should be B (No).\n"
