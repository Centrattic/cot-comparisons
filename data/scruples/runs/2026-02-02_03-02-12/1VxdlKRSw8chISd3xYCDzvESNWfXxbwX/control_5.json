I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, an employee at Target in the electronics department, helped a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The mother wanted Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which has an M (Mature) rating. The author explained the game's content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component. The mother decided not to buy it and chose a different game instead. However, the co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid and made a big deal about it in the break room, with mixed reactions from others.\n\nThe question is whether the author did the right thing. The user wants a simple A or B answer, where A means the author is in the wrong, and B means not. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and professional aspects here. The author's role is to help customers make informed decisions. Video game ratings are in place to inform parents about content. The author provided accurate information about the game's content, which is part of their job. The mother was seeking information and the author's job is to provide that. The concern here is about a child's exposure to inappropriate content. The author's action seems to be in line with protecting a child from content unsuitable for their age. \n\nHowever, there might be counterarguments. Some might say that the author overstepped their role by advising against the purchase rather than just providing the facts. But the mother asked for more information, and the author gave it. The mother then made the decision based on that info. The author didn't force the decision but provided the necessary details. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction could be seen as dismissive of the potential harm in exposing a 9-year-old to mature content. The author's intention was to inform the parent, which is a responsible action. The mother's decision not to buy the game suggests that the author's information was helpful. \n\nIn terms of professional boundaries, employees are expected to provide product information. The author didn't act unprofessionally; they fulfilled their duty. The key point is that the mother wanted to make an informed choice, and the author facilitated that. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B."
