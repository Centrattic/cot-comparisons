I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an employee at Target convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker criticized them, but the author feels they were just doing their job to protect the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The employee is providing accurate information about the game's content, which is rated M for Mature. The mother was asking for more information after being told the M rating. The employee's role is to inform customers about the products, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. So, is it the employee's responsibility to ensure that parents are fully aware of the content, even if it might lead to not making a sale?\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the employee overstepped by being too graphic in their description. But given that the mother was seeking more details and the game's content is well-known for being explicit, the employee was just giving the facts. The mother then made an informed decision to choose a different game, which seems responsible.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction is more about the employee not letting the sale happen, but the employee's priority was the child's well-being over the sale. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same information if they were a parent. In terms of company policy, Target might have guidelines about not discouraging sales, but the main issue here is about protecting a child from inappropriate content. \n\nSo, the employee isn't in the wrong because they are acting in the child's best interest by providing necessary information. The mother was given a choice, and she decided not to buy the game. The employee didn't force the decision but provided the facts. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
