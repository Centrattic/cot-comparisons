I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not letting a mother buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The user explained the game's M rating and the graphic content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker was upset about it.\n\nFirst, the user's intention seems good\u2014they wanted to inform the parent about the game's content, which is appropriate. Parents should know what they're buying for their kids. GTA V is an M-rated game with mature themes, so advising against it for a 9-year-old makes sense. The mother appreciated the info and changed her choice, which shows the user's actions were helpful.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction might stem from misunderstanding the user's intent. Maybe they thought the user was overstepping, but the user was just providing facts. The user's reasoning is sound: they're doing what they'd expect if they were in the parent's position. There's no evidence of malice here, just a duty to inform.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the user overstepped by actively discouraging the purchase instead of just stating the facts. But given the age of the child and the game's content, the user's action was protective. The parent made the decision based on the information, so the user isn't the one making the choice for them.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, they provided factual information and let the parent decide. The parent was grateful. The co-worker's dissatisfaction doesn't make the user wrong. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
