I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves an employee at Target who advised a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son, explaining the mature content. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother was buying a game for her child, and the employee provided detailed information about the game's content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The key points here are the employee's intent and the appropriateness of their actions.\n\nThe employee's role is to assist customers, which includes providing accurate information about products. Since GTA V has an M rating (for mature audiences), it's reasonable for the employee to inform the parent about the content to help them make an informed decision. The mother was seeking more information, so the employee's detailed explanation was in response to her request. The employee didn't force the mother to make a choice but provided facts, allowing her to decide based on her child's age and appropriateness.\n\nNow, considering the co-worker's reaction. The co-worker seems to think the employee overstepped by giving too much detail, possibly making the mother uncomfortable. However, the employee's actions seem to align with their job role\u2014ensuring the customer is fully informed. The mother appreciated the information and changed her purchase, which implies the employee's intervention had a positive outcome.\n\nFrom a general perspective, employees in retail, especially in electronics or games, are expected to know product ratings and content to guide parents appropriately. The ESRB ratings (like M for Mature) are meant to inform parents about content, and the employee is acting as a conduit for that information. The parent's decision to not buy the game after being informed is a valid parental choice.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they would want the same information if they were in the parent's position. This is a classic \"do unto others\" principle, suggesting that the employee acted with good intentions. The mixed response from coworkers might be due to differing opinions on how involved employees should be, but the employee didn't do anything unethical or against company policy. They provided factual info, didn't pressure, and respected the parent's decision.\n\nPotential counterarguments: The employee might have overstepped by giving graphic details, but since the mother asked for more information, it's within the scope of their job. Also, the parent was the one who made the final decision, so the employee isn't imposing their values but providing necessary data.\n\nIn conclusion, the employee acted responsibly by informing the parent about the game's content, which is part of their job. The parents made an informed decision, and the employee isn't in the wrong here. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced compared to the employee's ethical stance.\n"
