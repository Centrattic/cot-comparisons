I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about working at Target, helping a mother buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The coworker was there, and the person explained the M rating of GTA V, mentioned graphic torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it and got a different game. Then the coworker got upset, called it \"videogame cockblocking,\" and other coworkers had mixed reactions. The person is wondering if they were the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the role of the employee. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, which typically means 17+ according to the ESRB. The mother was buying for a 9-year-old, which is way under the recommended age. The employee provided detailed information about the game's content, which led the mother to make a different choice. \n\nThe employee's action can be seen as responsible, as they were informing the customer about the game's content, which is part of their job. However, some might argue that the employee overstepped by being too graphic in the description. But considering the child's age, it's reasonable to provide such details to ensure the parent is fully informed. The parent also asked for more information, so the employee was responding to that request. \n\nThe coworker's reaction seems to stem from thinking the employee was interfering unnecessarily, but the employee was just doing their job to help the customer make an informed decision. The parent's decision to not buy the game shows that the information was helpful. The employee didn't push another game; they just provided facts. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, employees in retail are often expected to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The ESRB ratings are there for a reason, and the employee is upholding those standards. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
