I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about whether the person who works at Target was wrong for advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The key points here are the age of the child, the content rating of the game, and the employee's intent.\n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M for Mature, which means it's intended for ages 17 and up. The parent asked for more info and the employee detailed the graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online interactions. The mother then decided against buying it. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee felt they were just being responsible.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the legal and ethical responsibilities of the employee. As an employee, they have a duty to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The mother was seeking advice for her child, so providing the necessary information to help her make an informed decision seems appropriate. The employee didn't force her not to buy the game; they just gave her the facts. The parent made the final decision. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the employee overstepped by being too detailed or by discouraging the purchase. However, the ESRB ratings are in place for a reason, and informing a parent about the content to help them make an educated choice is a responsible action. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced because the employee was acting in a position of trust, providing accurate information. \n\nConsidering all that, the employee isn't in the wrong. They were fulfilling their role by providing necessary details, allowing the parent to make a decision based on that information. The parent then chose a different game, which aligns with the intent of rating systems\u2014to guide parents in making appropriate choices for their children.\n"
