I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for telling a mother about the graphic content in GTA V to prevent her from buying it for her 9-year-old. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the employee's intent.\n\nFirst, GTA V has an M (Mature) rating, which the employee mentioned. The mother was buying for a 9-year-old, which is way under the recommended age. The employee gave more details about the game's content\u2014torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing. The mother then decided against purchasing it. \n\nThe co-worker was upset, but the employee's action seems to be about protecting a young child from content that's inappropriate. The employee's reasoning is that if they were a parent, they'd want to know the content. \n\nIs the employee wrong? The employee provided information the mother asked for, which helped her make an informed decision. Parents are responsible for their kids' media, but the employee isn't the parent. Their role is to inform customers. The main issue is whether the employee overstepped by giving graphic details. However, since the mother asked for more info, it's reasonable. Also, 9-year-olds are too young for M-rated games. The employee's action seems justified, not wrong. So, answer B.\n"
