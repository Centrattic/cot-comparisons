I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for persuading a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The situation is that the author works at Target and was helping a customer. The mother wanted GTA V for her son, and the author explained the M rating, graphic content, and other inappropriate elements, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author, and now the author is unsure if they were right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main concern was the age of the child. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which is typically for 17+. The mother's son is 9, which is way below that. The author provided factual information about the game's content, which is their job role since they work in electronics and know about game ratings. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to inform a parent about the content to help them make an informed decision. In many places, stores do have policies about not selling age-restricted games to minors, but the author wasn't preventing the sale; they were just providing information. The mother was the one who decided not to buy it after being informed. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction might be based on different priorities, maybe thinking the child should get what they want regardless of content. But the author's action aligns with protecting the child from inappropriate content, which is generally seen as responsible behavior. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were doing their job to inform and help the parent make a decision. The answer should be B.\n"
