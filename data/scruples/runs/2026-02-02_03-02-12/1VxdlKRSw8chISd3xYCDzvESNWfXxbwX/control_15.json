I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The employee explained the game's mature content, including graphic torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother then decided to buy a different game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it, but the employee is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game in question is rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, which is typically for ages 17+. GTA V is known for its mature themes, so the employee is just conveying the standard rating information. The mother's son is 9 years old, which is well below the recommended age. The employee's job is to help customers make informed decisions, so providing accurate information about the game's content seems like a responsible action.\n\nHowever, the employee went beyond just stating the rating and gave detailed examples of the game's content. Some might argue that it's the customer's responsibility to check the rating and decide what's appropriate, but in this case, the mother was \"naive\" and didn't know much about the game. By giving more details, the employee might have felt they were being thorough in helping the mother make a decision. \n\nNow, the question is whether the employee overstepped their role. Retail employees are expected to inform customers about products, including content warnings. However, there's a line between providing information and taking a moral stance. The employee didn't prevent the sale; they just shared the information, which led the mother to change her mind. The co-worker's reaction suggests some employees might view this as interfering, but if the employee's intention was to help the mother make a suitable choice for her child, then it's a valid concern.\n\nConsidering laws and policies, in many places, it's illegal to sell mature-rated games to minors. The employee might be upholding company policy by preventing underage purchases, but the mother wasn't trying to get the game for the child herself; she was purchasing it for her son. However, if the employee's role includes advising on appropriate content for children, then their action is justified. \n\nOn the flip side, some might say the employee shouldn't impose their personal views on content appropriateness. But in this case, the employee was just relaying the standard rating and content details, which is part of their job. The mother had the freedom to make the purchase if she still wanted to, but the information provided allowed her to make an informed choice. \n\nIn conclusion, the employee acted in what they believed was the child's best interest by providing necessary information, which led the mother to make a different choice. There's no indication of coercion or overstepping legally; it was a customer service action aimed at transparency. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
