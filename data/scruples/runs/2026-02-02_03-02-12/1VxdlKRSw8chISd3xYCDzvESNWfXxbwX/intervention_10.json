I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about this, and the author is unsure if they made the right decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game has an M rating (for mature audiences), which typically means it's not suitable for those under 17. The employee explained the content, which includes torture, sexual themes, and explicit language. The mother was concerned and changed her mind. The employee's intention was to inform the parent so they could make an educated decision, which is in line with their responsibility to advise customers.\n\nNow, the co-worker is upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the author's action seems to be in the interest of protecting a child from inappropriate content. The employee is not forcing the sale; they're providing information. The mother was the one who made the final decision after being informed. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same transparency if they were in the parent's position.\n\nConsidering ethical perspectives, the employee acted in good faith to prevent potential harm to a child by ensuring the parent was aware of the game's content. There's no indication that the employee acted out of malice or personal vendetta. The parent was given a choice, and the employee didn't go beyond providing the necessary information. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
