I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author worked at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The co-worker felt like they were \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author provided detailed information about the game's content, like the M rating, graphic scenes, violence, and other mature themes. The mother was concerned after that and chose a different game. The co-worker and others had mixed reactions, but the author feels they were just doing what they would want if they were the parent.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by being too graphic in their description. On one hand, the author is trying to inform the parent about the game's content to help them make an informed decision. Parents have a responsibility to know what their kids are playing, especially with age ratings. GTA V is definitely not suitable for a 9-year-old.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker might think that the author was being too intrusive or not their place to make that decision. But the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern. The mother was the one who made the final decision after being informed. The author didn't force her to do anything; they just provided the necessary information.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, it's about balancing the right to free speech and the responsibility to protect children. The author didn't violate any company policies, I assume. They just gave the parent the facts. The parent then used that information to decide. The author isn't in the wrong here because they're acting in the best interest of the child, even if the co-worker disagrees. The answer should be B (No).\n"
