I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is a Target employee who worked with a co-worker to help a mother buy a video game for her 9-year-old. The game in question is GTA V, which has an M rating. The employee explained the mature content, including graphic scenes, torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it and chose a different game instead. The co-worker then criticized the employee for \"cockblocking\" the son and made a big deal about it with others, getting mixed reactions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points to consider are the legal obligations of the seller, the age of the child, and the ethical responsibility of the employee. \n\nFirst, GTA V is rated M (Mature) by the ESRB, which means it's intended for ages 17 and up. Retailers are generally required to check the age of the buyer if they're under 18 for M-rated games. However, in this case, the mother was purchasing the game for her son, so the employee might not be legally obligated to refuse the sale if the mother is the one buying it. But the mother wasn't checking the content herself; she was asking the employee for more details. The employee provided accurate information about the game's content, which the mother then used to make an informed decision. \n\nEthically, the employee is acting in the best interest of the child by informing the parent about potentially inappropriate content. The employee's actions align with the principle of informing customers about product content, especially when there's a concern about age-appropriate material. The co-worker's criticism seems to stem from a different perspective, possibly valuing the child's autonomy or the parent's right to decide, but the employee's role here is to provide information, not to make the decision for the parent. \n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here: the employee went beyond just explaining the ESRB rating and into more detailed descriptions of the content. While providing accurate information is their job, being overly graphic might be seen as overstepping, depending on company policy. Some stores might have guidelines about how much detail to provide about content, especially when it comes to explicit descriptions. If the employee was following company protocol, then it's justified. But if they're going beyond what's expected, the company might have a different view. \n\nAnother angle is the parent's responsibility. The parent was the one buying the game for her son, so ultimately, the decision is hers. The employee is merely providing information that the parent requested. The parent used that information to make an informed choice, which is a positive outcome. The employee isn't forcing the decision; they're enabling the parent to decide based on facts. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the child wanting the game and the employee potentially \"denying\" the child's wish. However, the employee's role isn't to satisfy the child's desires but to ensure the parent is aware of what they're purchasing. The mixed reactions from coworkers indicate that there's no clear consensus, but the employee's actions seem to be in line with protecting the child from inappropriate content. \n\nIn summary, the employee provided necessary information about the game's content, which the parent used to make a responsible decision. As long as the employee wasn't violating company policy by giving too much detail, their actions were appropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
