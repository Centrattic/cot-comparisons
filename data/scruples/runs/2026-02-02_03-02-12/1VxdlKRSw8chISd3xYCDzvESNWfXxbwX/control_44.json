I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The employee is now getting some backlash from coworkers but thinks they were just helping the mother make an informed decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother wanted a game for her young child. GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The employee explained the content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The employee's coworker called it \"cockblocking,\" but the employee's intention was to provide accurate information to help the parent decide.\n\nI should think about the responsibilities of a salesperson. Employees are often expected to provide honest information about products, especially regarding content ratings and appropriateness for children. The employee didn't force the mother not to buy it, just gave her the facts. The mother made the decision herself after being informed. \n\nIn many places, stores are required to inform customers about content ratings, especially for minors. The employee might even be following company policy. The M rating is a clear indicator, but the employee went further to explain the specific content, which could be beneficial. The coworker's criticism seems to be more about the employee interfering, but the employee's action is about protecting the child from inappropriate content. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might feel that the employee overstepped by influencing the customer's choice. However, the employee's intention was to help the parent make an educated decision, which is generally seen as responsible. The mother was the one who decided against the purchase after knowing the details. The employee didn't make the decision for her but provided necessary information. \n\nSo, considering all that, the employee isn't in the wrong. They were fulfilling their role by giving the customer accurate information about the product's content, which is in the customer's best interest and the child's well-being.\n"
