I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they work at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset about it, but the mother decided not to buy the game.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. GTA V has an M rating, which stands for Mature, typically recommending it for ages 17+. The employee provided information about the content, which is their job to do, right? They explained the M rating and the specific content like torture, sexual themes, swearing. The mother asked for more info, so the employee gave it. The mother then chose not to buy the game. \n\nIs there a policy at Target about not giving too much detail about game content? If the employee is supposed to just state the rating and not elaborate, then maybe they overstepped. But if their role is to inform customers about content, then they were doing their job. \n\nAlso, the co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the mother was concerned and changed her purchase. The employee's reasoning is that they would want similar info if buying for their own kids. That's a reasonable perspective. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the employee act within their job responsibilities? Was the information provided appropriate? The mother didn't force the purchase; the employee gave factual details about the game's content. The mother made an informed decision. \n\nI think the employee wasn't wrong. They provided necessary information to help the mother make a decision. The co-worker's reaction might stem from thinking the employee was too involved, but the main goal here is to protect the customer's interests by informing them. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
