I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author worked at Target and helped a mother buy a video game. The child was 9, and the mother wanted GTA V. The author explained the M rating and the graphic content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by informing the parents.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were appropriate. The main points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the role of the employee in advising. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, which typically means 17+ according to the ESRB. The mother was buying for a 9-year-old, so there's a clear age discrepancy. The author provided information about the game's content, which includes violence, swearing, sexual themes, etc. The mother, after being informed, decided not to buy it. \n\nThe author's defense is that they were doing what they would want for their own kids. The co-worker's criticism seems to be about not letting the kid play a game they want, but the parent's responsibility is to know the content and make decisions based on that. The author didn't prevent the sale; they provided information, and the parent made the choice. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They were informing the parent about the content, which is part of their job, especially when the child is way below the recommended age. The parent's decision to not buy the game after being informed shows that the author's intervention was helpful. The co-worker's reaction is more about the child's disappointment, but the parent's responsibility is to make informed choices. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
