I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is working at Target in electronics and helped a mother who wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. They explained the M rating and the graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized them for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's intention was to inform the parent about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, so selling it to a 9-year-old would be against the rating guidelines. The author was following the ESRB rating system's purpose, which is to inform parents about content so they can make educated decisions.\n\nHowever, the co-worker felt the author overstepped. But isn't it the store's responsibility to uphold ratings? If the parent asked for more details, the author was just providing accurate information. The parent made the decision based on that, so the author didn't force them. It's about parental responsibility and informed consent. The author isn't wrong for doing their job or helping a parent make a responsible choice. \n\nAnother angle: Could the author have been too graphic? They mentioned specific scenes, which might be seen as unnecessary. But the mother asked for more info, so transparency is key here. The parent's choice to not buy the game after being informed shows the information was useful. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is sound\u2014they'd want similar info for their own kids. So, from a moral standpoint, they're acting in the child's best interest. The co-worker's reaction might stem from a different view on freedom of choice, but the author isn't obligated to push the sale. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information, respected the parent's decision-making process, and adhered to the game's rating guidelines. The co-worker's criticism is subjective and doesn't override the ethical duty to inform.\n"
