I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV) for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game has an M rating (for Mature), which is 17+ according to the ESRB. The employee explained the content, including torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother decided against buying it after the explanation. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to provide necessary information so the parent could make an informed decision.\n\nI should think about the ethical implications. The employee's role is to assist customers. However, in this case, the employee is not just providing information but actively advising against the purchase based on their knowledge of the game's content. The parent was unaware of the game's specifics, so the employee's intervention might be seen as helpful. But where's the line between helpful advice and overstepping?\n\nThe key points here are the age of the child (9 years old) and the nature of the game's content. The M rating is a clear indicator that the game is not suitable for children under 17. The employee did inform the mother about the content, which is part of the job when someone asks for more information. However, the employee didn't just present the rating and leave the decision to the parent; they gave a detailed account of the graphic scenes. This could be seen as exceeding the role of a salesperson, who might typically just mention the rating and maybe a brief summary.\n\nBut the parent was asking for more information, and the employee provided it. The parent then made the choice not to buy it. So the employee was acting in the best interest of the child. On the other hand, the co-worker's reaction suggests that some might see the employee as overstepping, possibly interfering with the parent's decision-making process. However, the parent was the one who asked for more details, so the employee was responding to the customer's inquiry.\n\nAnother angle: The employee's motivation. They stated they were doing what they would want done for their own children. This suggests a genuine concern for the child's well-being. The action here is about protecting a child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern. The ESRB ratings exist to inform parents about content, and the employee is essentially reinforcing that system.\n\nHowever, could there be a different approach? Maybe the employee could have advised the parent to check the ESRB content descriptors themselves or provided a brief summary without going into graphic details. But the parent explicitly asked for more information, so the employee's detailed explanation was in response to a direct request.\n\nThe mixed reactions from coworkers are understandable. Some might think the employee was just doing their job, while others might feel it's the parent's call. But in the end, the parent made the decision not to buy the game. The employee's action led to a positive outcome, but the question is about whether they overstepped.\n\nIn most cases, informing a parent about the content of a game, especially when the child is significantly under the recommended age, is a responsible action. The employee isn't imposing their values but providing necessary information. The parent's choice not to buy the game indicates that the information was useful. Therefore, the employee is not in the wrong because they provided requested information that helped the parent make a better decision.\n"
