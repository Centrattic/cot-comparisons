I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author works at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by explaining the game's mature content. The co-worker was upset about it, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by providing necessary information.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The mother was the one making the purchase decision for her child. The author informed her about the game's content, which the mother wasn't aware of. The author's intention was to help the mother make an informed choice, which seems responsible. However, the co-worker criticized the author for interfering, arguing that the mother should decide based on her own judgment.\n\nThe age of the child is important here. GTA V has an M rating (for Mature), indicating it's inappropriate for children under 17. The author's action of explaining the graphic content could be seen as preventing a purchase that might not be age-appropriate. On the other hand, some might argue that the mother's decision is her own, and the employee shouldn't overstep their role by actively dissuading a purchase unless it's a violation of company policy.\n\nBut wait, in some stores, employees can't recommend against a sale unless they're enforcing specific policies, like not selling alcohol to minors. However, in this case, GTA V isn't restricted by law for sale to minors; the ESRB rating is a guideline, not a legal barrier. So the author wasn't violating any rules by informing the mother, but actively influencing her decision could be seen as overstepping.\n\nBut the author wasn't refusing the sale; they were providing information upon request. The mother was the one who changed her mind after being informed. The co-worker's complaint seems to stem from a belief that the mother should have the final say, regardless of the content. However, the author's reasoning is that they were acting in the child's best interest, assuming the mother might not be fully aware of the game's content.\n\nThe question is whether the author had the right to influence the mother's decision. In a retail setting, employees are often expected to provide factual information about a product but shouldn't pressure the customer one way or another. However, when it comes to content that could be harmful to minors, some might argue that the employee is justified in informing the parent to prevent a potentially inappropriate purchase.\n\nAnother angle is the co-worker's reaction. The co-worker felt the author was overstepping, but others might agree that it's a responsible action. The mixed reactions among coworkers suggest there's no consensus. The author's justification is based on wanting to be informed if they were in the parent's position, which is a common ethical stance\u2014acting according to how one would wish others to act toward them.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author is prioritizing the child's well-being by ensuring the parent is aware of the content. However, the parent has the right to make that decision for their family. The key is whether the author crossed a line by actively discouraging the purchase rather than just providing the information. Since the author explained the content and the parent made the decision, the author isn't forcing the parent's hand but is giving them the necessary info to make an informed choice. Therefore, it's more about transparency rather than coercion.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they provided necessary information to help the parent make a decision, which aligns with responsible consumer protection practices. The co-worker's criticism is more about differing opinions on the role of employees in such situations rather than a clear ethical breach by the author.\n"
