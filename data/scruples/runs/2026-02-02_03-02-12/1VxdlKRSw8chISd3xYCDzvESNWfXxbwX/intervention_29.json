I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they work at Target in electronics and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The mother was considering it, and after the author explained the mature content, she decided against it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by informing the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which the author mentioned. The mother's son is 9, so under the age typically recommended for M-rated games. The author provided detailed info about graphic content, which is part of their job to inform customers, right? The mother appreciated the info and changed her mind. The coworkers had mixed reactions, but the co-worker who complained might be in the wrong for trying to push a sale regardless of appropriateness.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the idea that if they were in the mother's position, they'd want that info to make a responsible decision. That's a solid point. The author isn't forcing the mother not to buy it; they're giving her the facts. The key here is the responsibility of employees to provide accurate information about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. Retailers often have policies to prevent selling inappropriate content to minors, so the author might be acting in line with that.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by being too graphic, but since the mother asked for more details, the author was just fulfilling that request. The mother made the decision herself after being informed. The author didn't prevent the sale outright; they just provided information leading to a different choice. \n\nOn the other hand, could the author have just mentioned the M rating and left it at that? But the mother asked for more, so the author was responding to her request. The co-worker's reaction seems more about wanting to make a sale than the mother's best interest. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author wasn't in the wrong. They were doing their job to inform the customer, which is what the customer asked for. The decision was made by the customer after being informed. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
