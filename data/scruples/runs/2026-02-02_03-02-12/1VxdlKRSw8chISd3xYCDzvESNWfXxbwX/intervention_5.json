I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, working at Target, advised a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son after detailing the graphic content. The co-workers had mixed reactions, some even called it \"cockblocking.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the child. The mother's son is 9, and GTA V has an M rating (for Mature), which is typically for 17+. The author explained the content, which included torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother decided against buying it after that. \n\nI think the key here is the store's policy. In many places, stores can refuse to sell age-restricted items to minors. For example, in the US, some states have laws about selling R-rated movies or M-rated games to children. If the store's policy is to not sell GTA V to someone underage, then the author might be following that. However, the question is whether the author overstepped by giving a detailed explanation instead of just checking the age.\n\nBut wait, the mother was the one buying the game for her son. So the age restriction is on the buyer or the recipient? If the store policy allows selling to someone of legal age, but the content is inappropriate, the employee's role is to inform. The author might be doing their duty by explaining the content, even if the parent is the legal buyer. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the employee shouldn't be the one policing content choices for parents. However, the mother asked for more information and the author provided it. The mother then made her own decision. So the author didn't force her not to buy it; she chose not to after being informed. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction suggests that some people might think the author was interfering. But the author's reasoning is that they wanted to be informed as a parent would. It's a matter of responsibility versus overstepping. Since the author didn't violate any policies and provided factual information, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nAlso, considering that GTA V is rated M, which is meant to warn parents about content, the author is acting in line with that rating system. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
