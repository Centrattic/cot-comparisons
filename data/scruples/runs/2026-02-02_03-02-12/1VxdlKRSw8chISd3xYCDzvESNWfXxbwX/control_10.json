I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author works at Target in electronics. A customer came in to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author, aware of the game's M rating (which is for mature audiences), explained the graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online multiplayer. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it, with mixed reactions from others.\n\nNow, the author is questioning if they were in the wrong. They argue that if they were a parent buying a game they knew nothing about, they'd want that info to make an informed decision. So their stance is that they were just providing necessary information to help the mother make a choice.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, employees in retail are often expected to inform customers about products, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. The ESRB ratings exist for a reason, and explaining the content that aligns with those ratings is part of responsible sales practice. The mother was seeking more info because she wasn't familiar with the game, so the author's role was to provide that context. \n\nHowever, could there be a line crossed? Maybe if the author went beyond the facts and injected personal judgment. But in the scenario, the author listed specific content (torture scenes, etc.), which is factual. They didn't seem to be making a moral judgment but stating the content as per the rating. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction might stem from thinking the author overstepped, but the mother made her own decision after being informed. The author's action was in line with their role as a salesperson responsible for product information, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. \n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help the customer make an informed decision, which is their job. The mother chose not to buy the game based on that info, so the author's actions were appropriate.\n"
