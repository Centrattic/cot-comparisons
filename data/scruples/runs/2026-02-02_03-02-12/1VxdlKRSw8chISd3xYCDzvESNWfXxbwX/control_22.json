I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Target employee who advised a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son, explaining the game's M rating and graphic content. The co-worker felt it was \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The employee was providing accurate information about the game's content, which is part of their job. The mother asked for more details, and the employee gave them, leading the mother to make an informed decision. That seems responsible. The employee didn't force her not to buy it; they just shared info so she could decide. \n\nThen there's the co-worker's reaction. The co-worker is upset because maybe he thought the employee was overstepping. But the employee was just doing their job, ensuring the parent had all the facts. The employee's motivation was to protect the child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern. The parents are the ones who decide what's suitable for their kids, but the employee gave them the tools to make that decision.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no wrongdoing here. The employee didn't break any company policies unless there's a rule against discussing content ratings, which isn't mentioned. The key is that the employee provided necessary information without being pushy. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong. The other side might argue that the employee shouldn't interfere, but the parent's right to know and protect their child is stronger.\n"
