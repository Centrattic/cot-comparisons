I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who detailed the graphic content of GTA V to a mother was in the wrong. The scenario involves a 9-year-old wanting the game, and the employee explained the mature content leading the mom to choose another game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking.\"\n\nFirst, the employee was doing their job. GTA V has an M rating, which is for mature audiences. The employee provided accurate information about the game's content, which is standard practice to help customers make informed decisions. The mother was concerned after being informed, which makes sense given the age of the child. The employee's actions were in line with helping the customer make a responsible choice, not just for their own kids but in general. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the employee interfering, but the employee wasn't overstepping. They were giving factual info. The key point here is that the employee was acting in the best interest of the child's well-being, respecting the parent's responsibility. There's no legal issue here; the employee isn't obligated to lie or withhold information. In many places, stores have policies to inform customers about content ratings. The employee's actions align with ethical standards of providing necessary details to help parents make decisions. The co-worker's \"dick move\" comment is dismissive but not justified. The mixed reactions from coworkers might indicate some people don't see the issue, but the employee was clearly doing the right thing. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
