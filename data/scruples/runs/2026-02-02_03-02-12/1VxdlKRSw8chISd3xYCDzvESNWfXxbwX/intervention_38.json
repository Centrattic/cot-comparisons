I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author works at Target in electronics. A customer, a mother with a 9-year-old son, came in to buy GTA V. The author explained the game's M rating and the explicit content: torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online multiplayer. The mother decided not to buy it and got a different game instead. The co-worker was upset, saying it was \"cockblocking,\" and other coworkers had mixed reactions. The author is questioning if they were the asshole for stopping the sale.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if they were in the same situation with their own kids, they'd want to know the content before buying. They felt they were doing the right thing by informing the mother.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong? The options are A for yes, B for no. The user thinks the answer is B, but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle here. The author was trying to protect a child from inappropriate content, which is a common concern. The game is rated M for mature audiences, which typically isn't suitable for kids under 17. The author provided accurate information that the mother might not have known, helping her make an informed decision. \n\nHowever, there's the counterpoint: is it the employee's place to tell a customer not to buy a product? Retail employees usually provide information, not make decisions for customers. The mother might have known the rating but decided it was okay for her son. The author's intervention could be seen as overstepping, assuming they know better than the parent. Parents have the right to make choices about their children's media consumption, even if others disagree.\n\nBut the situation is different because the mother was asking for more information. She wasn't aware of the specific content. The author explained the details, which led her to change her mind. So, the author was responding to a request for more info rather than actively trying to stop the sale. The key here is that the author didn't block the sale; the mother made the choice after being informed. \n\nAlso, GTA V's content is well-documented. The ESRB rating is clear, but the mother might not have known the specifics. The author filled in the gaps, which is helpful. On the other hand, some might argue that the mother should be trusted to decide what's appropriate for her child, even if others think she's making a mistake.\n\nAnother angle: the co-worker's reaction. He called it \"cockblocking,\" implying it's interfering with the sale. But the author's intention was to help the mother make a better decision, not to push for a sale. Retail ethics usually encourage transparency, especially regarding content warnings.\n\nIn similar scenarios, for example, a bookseller explaining the content of a book with explicit material to a parent, it's generally considered appropriate. The same logic applies here. The employee is acting in the customer's best interest by providing necessary information that aligns with their values as a parent.\n\nBut the line could be crossed if the employee is being judgmental or imposing their own values. However, the author here seems to be acting out of concern, based on their own hypothetical as a parent. They're not making a value judgment but providing facts.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. They provided information the customer requested and helped her make an informed choice. The mother was the one who decided to change her purchase. The author's actions were within their role to inform and support the customer's decision-making process.\n"
