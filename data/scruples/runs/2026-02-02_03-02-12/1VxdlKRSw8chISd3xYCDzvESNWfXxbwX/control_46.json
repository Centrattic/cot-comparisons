I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTA V to a mother who wanted to buy it for her 9-year-old son.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the context. The author works at Target in electronics and was helping a customer. The customer's son is 9, and the game (GTA V) has an M rating. The author mentioned the M rating and then provided more details about the game's content when asked. The mother decided not to buy it after being informed. The co-worker then criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" the kid, but the author feels they were just doing the right thing by providing necessary information.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author informed the mother about the game's content beyond the standard M rating. The mother was concerned and made a different choice. The co-worker was upset but others had mixed reactions. The author's reasoning is that if they were in the mother's position and knew nothing about the game, they'd want the same info. \n\nI should consider the store's policies. Retailers often have age restrictions and are supposed to inform customers about ratings. The M rating is for mature audiences, typically 17 and up. So by allowing the sale, the store is supposed to check if the customer is complying with the rating. Here, the mother was buying for a 9-year-old, which is way below the M rating. The author's role is to enforce the ratings, not just mention the M rating but explain why it's rated that way. \n\nIs the author overstepping? Maybe if they were pressuring the mother instead of informing her, but in this case, the author was explaining the content to help her make an informed decision. The mother was the one who decided not to buy after being informed. The author's actions align with their duty to inform about the game's content. The co-worker's reaction might be more about wanting the kid to have the game regardless of content, but the author's concern is about protecting the child from inappropriate content. \n\nSo, based on that, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help the parent make a responsible choice. The store's policy would support that. The mother had the final say, and the author didn't force her decision but gave facts. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
