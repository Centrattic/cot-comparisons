I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTA V to a mother buying a game for her 9-year-old son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works in electronics at Target and was helping a customer. The customer wanted GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author explained the game's M rating and detailed the graphic scenes like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decided not to buy it and chose another game. The coworker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to inform the parent to make a responsible choice.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author did wrong. From a moral standpoint, the author was providing factual information about the game's content, which is appropriate. Parents have the right to know what they're purchasing for their children, especially regarding age-inappropriate content. The author didn't coerce or lie; they gave the mother the facts to make an informed decision. The coworker's complaint seems more about the mother's choice rather than the author's action. The author's reasoning aligns with the principle of helping others make informed decisions, which is a positive action. There's no indication of malice or overstepping in the explanation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
