I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author works at Target, helping a customer buy a video game. The mother's son is 9, and GTA V is rated M, which is for 17+. The author explained the M rating and gave details about graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother decided not to buy it and chose another game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intention to protect the child from inappropriate content. The author believed they were acting in the child's best interest by providing necessary information. The mother was seeking more info and changed her decision after being informed. From a parental responsibility standpoint, it's common for parents to avoid exposing young kids to M-rated games. The author's action aligns with the idea of being honest about product content, especially when it's age-inappropriate.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by not just mentioning the rating but detailing specific graphic scenes. But given the mother's explicit request for more info, the author provided factual details that are relevant to her decision-making. The author also compared it to how they would want to be informed if buying for their own kids. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is more about not wanting to restrict the child's game choices, but the author's primary responsibility is to inform the customer accurately, which they did. The mother made the final decision, so the author isn't forcing her hand but providing necessary information. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted ethically by prioritizing the child's well-being and the parent's right to make informed choices. The answer should be B (No).\n"
