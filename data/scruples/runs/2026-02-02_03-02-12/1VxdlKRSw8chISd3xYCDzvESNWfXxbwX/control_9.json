I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Target employee convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son, citing the game's M rating and its graphic content. The coworker was upset about it, but the author believes they were just being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The employee provided information about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate. The mother was seeking advice, and the employee explained the M rating details. The mother then decided against buying it. Legally, in the US, stores can refuse to sell age-restricted items to minors, but here, the employee is advising, not refusing. However, the key point is whether providing accurate information about content is wrong.\n\nThe employee's action seems to align with their role in assisting customers. The mother asked for more info, and the employee gave it. The employee's intention was to inform, not to force a decision. The mother made the choice based on that info. The coworker's criticism is about \"cockblocking,\" but that's more about personal opinions on gaming. The author's perspective is that they were acting in the child's best interest, similar to how they'd want for their own kids.\n\nAlso, the ESRB ratings exist for a reason, and the employee is just highlighting what's already rated. The mother might not have been aware of the specifics, so the employee's intervention could prevent the child from accessing inappropriate content. There's no indication the employee overstepped; they provided information without being pushy. The mixed reactions from coworkers don't necessarily make the action wrong\u2014it's more about differing opinions on how to handle such situations.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They did their job by informing the customer, respecting the rating system, and helping the mother make an informed decision. The answer should be B.\n"
