I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person at Target is helping a customer buy a game for her 9-year-old son. The customer asks for more info about GTA V. The employee explains the M rating, mentions graphic content like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mom decides not to buy it. The coworker is upset, says it's \"cockblocking,\" and others have mixed reactions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the employee was wrong. The user wants to know if they're the asshole. The employee's reasoning is that they're providing info the mom would want if she didn't know the game. They see it as doing what they'd want for their own kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom was asking for more info, and the employee gave it. The M rating is a warning about mature content, which GTA V definitely has. The employee didn't force her not to buy it; they provided facts. The mom made the decision based on that. The coworker's reaction is more about the employee \"denying\" a purchase, but the employee was just giving accurate info. The mom is the one who made the choice. The employee's actions seem ethical because they were being honest and helping the customer make an informed decision. They didn't lie or exaggerate. The ESRB ratings are there for a reason, and the employee is upholding their role by informing the customer. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They were doing their job to help the customer make a responsible choice.\n"
