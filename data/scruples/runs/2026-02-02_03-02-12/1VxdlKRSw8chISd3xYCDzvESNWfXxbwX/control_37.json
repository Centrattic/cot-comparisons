I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person works at Target, in electronics. They had a customer who wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating and detailed some of the more graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother was concerned and decided not to buy it. Then the co-worker complained about being \"cockblocked\" and made a big deal in the break room. The author is unsure if they did the right thing, thinking that if they were a parent, they'd want to know about the content too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether providing detailed information about the game's content to prevent a purchase for a child under 16-18 is wrong. \n\nIn retail, employees often give information about products. The ESRB ratings already exist for this purpose, so the author was just explaining the M rating in more detail. The customer asked for more information, so the author provided it. The mother made her own decision based on that info. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is part of the scenario. The author's co-worker felt it was a problem because maybe they wanted the sale to go through. But the author's role is to inform the customer, not to push for a sale. Retail employees are there to help customers make informed decisions. \n\nAlso, the age of the child is a factor. The author mentions 9 years old, and the game is rated M for mature audiences. So the age group specified in the question is 16-18, but the child is much younger. The author's action helped prevent a purchase that might not be age-appropriate. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is acting in the best interest of the child and the parent. They're providing honest information so the parent can make a decision. There's no indication that the author overstepped by giving more details than asked, but the mother specifically asked for more info, so they answered truthfully. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author shouldn't have given such graphic details, but since the parent asked, it's their responsibility to inform. Also, the parent might have made an informed choice if they knew. The author isn't forcing the decision; they're just informing. \n\nThe co-worker's complaint is about not wanting to interfere, but the author's action was about responsibility and child safety. The author isn't in the wrong because they did their job correctly by providing necessary information. Retail employees aren't supposed to upsell or downplay content; they should be honest. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They helped the parent make a better decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
