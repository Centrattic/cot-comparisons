I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The employee explained the M rating and detailed the graphic content, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker called it \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intention was to inform the parent.\n\nThe main question is whether the employee overstepped. On one hand, the employee provided necessary information about the game's content, which could be seen as responsible, especially since the game is rated for older audiences. The parent might not have known the details, and the employee was helping them make an informed decision. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's the parent's choice and the employee shouldn't impose their own values. However, the ESRB ratings exist for a reason, and stores often help enforce those guidelines. The employee wasn't forcing the mother not to buy the game but informed her about content she might not know about, allowing her to decide. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction suggests some people might see it as interference, but the author's reasoning is about protecting a child from inappropriate content. The mother was the one who decided not to buy it after being informed. So the employee didn't override the decision but provided information that led to the mother's choice.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about balancing honesty and respecting parental choices. The ESRB rating is a standard, and helping enforce it could be seen as doing the right thing. The author's action aligns with protecting a child from content unsuitable for their age. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
