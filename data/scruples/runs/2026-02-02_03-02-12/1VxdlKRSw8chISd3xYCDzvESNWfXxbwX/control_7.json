I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Ask Me Anything (AMA) is in the wrong for discouraging a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son. \n\nFirst, I need to recall what GTA V is like. It's an M-rated game with explicit content\u2014violence, strong language, sexual themes. The author detailed these elements to the mother, which led her to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized this as \"cockblocking,\" but the author's intent was to inform the parent about the content.\n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility as an employee. In retail, employees often provide information about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate ratings. The mother asked for more information, so the author was just answering her questions truthfully. The mother then made the decision based on that info. It seems like the author was acting in good faith, wanting to help the parent make an informed choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker's reaction might stem from a different opinion on parental responsibility. Some might argue that the parent should have done their own research, but the author didn't overstep; they just relayed the facts. The author isn't forcing the decision, just providing necessary details.\n\nAlso, the mother's son is 9 years old, and M-rated games are generally intended for ages 17 and up. The author's action aligns with the game's rating guidelines. There's no indication the author used inappropriate language or pressured the mother. They simply explained the content, which is part of the job in electronics sales, especially when dealing with parental purchases.\n\nThe mixed reactions from coworkers don't necessarily mean the author was wrong. Different people have different views on how involved employees should be in such decisions, but the author's action was within the bounds of professional duty. The main question is whether providing factual information about a product's content is crossing a line. Since the author didn't invent the content or misrepresent it, they're likely just doing their job correctly.\n"
