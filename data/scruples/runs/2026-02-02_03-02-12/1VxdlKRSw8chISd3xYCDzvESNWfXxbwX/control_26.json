I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a worker at Target who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the game's graphic content. The co-worker was upset, calling it \"videogame cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The employee is providing information about the game's content, which is rated M (Mature) for good reason. The mother didn't know much about the game, and the employee explained the explicit content like torture scenes, sexual themes, and strong language. The mother then chose not to buy it. \n\nFrom a general standpoint, informing customers about product content isn't wrong. In fact, it's part of responsible sales advice. The employee was acting in what they believe is the child's best interest. The mother had the final say, and she used the information to make a decision. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the employee overstepping. They didn't just mention the rating but went into graphic details. However, the mother asked for more information, so the employee was responding to her request. The key here is that the mother was seeking clarification, and the employee provided the necessary details to make an informed choice. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction is about the employee interfering, but the mother wasn't forced; she made the decision herself after being informed. The employee's intention was to help, not to be a jerk. \n\nSo, considering all that, the employee isn't in the wrong. They provided requested information that helped the mother make a responsible choice. The answer should be B (No).\n"
