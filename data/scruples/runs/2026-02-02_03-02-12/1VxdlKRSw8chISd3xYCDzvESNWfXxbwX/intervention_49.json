I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the situation: The person works at Target, in electronics. When a customer comes in for GTA V for her 9-year-old, the employee explains the M rating, graphic content like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decides against GTAV. The co-worker was annoyed, saying it was \"cockblocking,\" but the others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were just providing information to help the mother make an informed decision. They argue that if they were in a similar situation, they'd want to know the game's content for their own kids. \n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI need to evaluate the ethics here. The employee's role is to assist customers, which includes informing them about product content. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, which is a clear warning. The employee didn't force the mother to not buy it; they provided facts. The mother made the decision herself after being informed. \n\nThe co-worker's complaint is about \"cockblocking,\" implying he wanted to buy the game for the kid. But the employee's primary responsibility is to the customer's needs, which in this case is providing accurate information. The employee isn't the parent; they're just giving the facts. \n\nThere's no indication that the employee was rude or overstepped. They were honest about the game's content, which is a standard practice. Parents are expected to use the ESRB ratings to make decisions, and the employee helped clarify those ratings. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the employee shouldn't have given such detailed info, but the mother asked for more information. The employee answered truthfully. Also, the mother chose not to buy it, which was her right. \n\nIn most retail jobs, employees are trained to provide accurate product info, including content warnings. The employee here did that. The co-worker's annoyance seems misplaced because the employee wasn't violating any company policy. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help the customer make a responsible choice. The answer should be B.\n"
