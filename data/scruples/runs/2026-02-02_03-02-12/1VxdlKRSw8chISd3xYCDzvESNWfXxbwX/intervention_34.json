I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who, when a mother was buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son, gave a detailed explanation of the game's mature content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The coworker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking,\" but the employee feels they were just helping the parent make an informed decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game has an M rating, which stands for Mature, typically suggesting it's not suitable for those under 17. The employee explained the content, which includes graphic scenes, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase. The employee's coworker felt it was a \"dick move,\" but the employee's intention was to inform the parent, not to block the sale but to help her make a responsible choice.\n\nI need to think about the ethics here. The employee was in a position to provide information that the customer might not know. The mother was the one making the decision, and the employee was giving her the facts to make an informed choice. The employee isn't forcing her not to buy the game, just providing information. The coworker's reaction might be based on a different perspective, maybe thinking the customer should have the right to buy any game they want, but the employee's role is to assist, not to make that decision. \n\nAlso, the age of the child is a key factor. A 9-year-old is well below the recommended age for an M-rated game. The employee is acting in a responsible manner by highlighting content that could be inappropriate. The employee's reasoning is that they would want to know such details if they were a parent. This is a common ethical stance\u2014acting in the best interest of a child by providing necessary information to parents.\n\nHowever, could there be a line crossed? If the employee had overstepped by making a judgment or refusing the sale outright without giving options, maybe. But here, the employee provided information and the mother made the choice. The employee didn't prevent the sale but gave the mother the tools to decide. So, the action seems appropriate. The coworker's criticism might stem from a different view on personal responsibility versus corporate responsibility, but the employee's intent was to be helpful and responsible.\n\nIn conclusion, the employee isn't in the wrong because they provided necessary information to help a parent make a decision, which is a responsible action. The answer should be B.\n"
