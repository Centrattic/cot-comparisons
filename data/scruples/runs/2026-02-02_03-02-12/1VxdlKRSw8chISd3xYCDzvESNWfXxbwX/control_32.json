I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit-style post is in the wrong for convincing a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author gave detailed info about the game's mature content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author feels they were just being responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother's son is 9, which is way under the 16-18 age range mentioned in the M rating. The author explained the game's content, which included graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother was concerned and changed her purchase. The co-worker and others had mixed reactions, but the author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nLegally, in many places, stores don't have to enforce age ratings, but there's an ethical consideration here. The author is in a position of trust helping the customer. Providing accurate information about game content is generally considered responsible, especially when a child's age is far below the recommended age. The mother asked for more info, so the author answered honestly. Even if the co-worker felt it was overstepping, the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The author's reasoning aligns with wanting to be informed if they were in the customer's shoes.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author shouldn't have gone into graphic details, but the mother specifically asked for more information. The author didn't force her not to buy it; they just provided the facts. The result was the mother made a different choice, which is the goal of age ratings. There's no indication the author acted maliciously. So, the author's actions seem justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
