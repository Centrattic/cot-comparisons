I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTA V to a mother with a 9-year-old. The author worked at Target, helped a customer, and after the mother decided not to buy the game, a co-worker complained. The key points are: the game has an M rating, the author provided detailed info about explicit content, and the mother chose a different game.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A or B. Let's consider the ethical aspects. The author was providing necessary information. The M rating is a guideline, but the mother might not know what it entails. By explaining the content, the author helped her make an informed decision. The co-worker's reaction is about not wanting to interfere, but the author's action is about protecting a child from inappropriate content, which is a valid concern.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that if they were a parent, they'd want to know. That's a common ethical stance\u2014acting as you'd want others to act. There's no indication the author forced the decision; the mother made the choice herself. The author didn't prevent the sale but provided info that led the mother to decide against it. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by giving such detailed descriptions. But given the age of the child and the content of the game, it's reasonable to be thorough. The mother had asked for more info, so the author was responding to her request. \n\nI think the author is in the right because they were helping the parent make an informed choice. The co-worker's criticism is about personal boundaries, but the author's action was protective and responsible. So the answer should be B.\n"
