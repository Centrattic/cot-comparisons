I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target and convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker was upset, and the author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother wanted to buy an M-rated game for a 9-year-old. The employee explained the content, which led the mother to decide against it. The question is whether the employee overstepped or was just doing their job.\n\nMoral responsibility here: The employee's role is to provide information about the product. GTA V is rated M for mature audiences, which is a clear indicator. However, the mother might not be aware of what that rating entails. By explaining the graphic scenes, the employee is helping the parent make an informed decision, which aligns with the company's policy of providing product information. \n\nBut there's a line between informing and imposing personal values. The employee didn't stop the sale but gave information based on the game's content. The mother chose not to buy it after being informed. The co-worker's reaction is about disagreeing with the employee's intervention, but the employee's intention was to help the parent make a choice, not to dictate it. \n\nAlso, the age of the child is a factor. 9 years old is well below the recommended age for M-rated games. The employee's action could be seen as responsible, as they're preventing a purchase that might not be suitable. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the consequences. The employee's intent was to inform, not to be judgmental. The mother appreciated the info and changed her decision. Co-workers' mixed reactions don't necessarily mean the employee was wrong. The employee was advocating for responsible gaming, which is a common concern. \n\nSo, the answer is likely No (B), the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information to help the parent make an informed choice, which is their duty as an employee.\n"
