I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit-style post is in the wrong for dissuading a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target, specifically in electronics. They were helping a customer buy a game for her son, who's 9. The game in question is GTA V, which has an M (Mature) rating. The author explained the content in detail, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong. The author's reasoning is that they were providing necessary information so the mother could make an informed decision, similar to how they would want for their own kids. \n\nNow, considering the M rating on games is meant to indicate content unsuitable for minors. The author's role is to inform customers accurately. The mother asked for more information, so the author provided it. The mother then made a decision based on that info. The author didn't force her not to buy it; they just gave the facts. The co-worker's complaint is about the author interfering with a sale, but the author's primary duty is to the customer's best interest, not the store's sales metrics. \n\nFrom a consumer protection and parental rights perspective, giving detailed info about content is a responsible action. The author isn't making a judgment beyond the facts; they're informing the parent. The mother had the agency to decide. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
