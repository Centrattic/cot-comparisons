I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for explaining the graphic content of GTA V to a mother buying a game for her 9-year-old son. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the employee's role in providing information.\n\nFirst, GTA V has an M rating, which stands for \"Mature\" and typically recommends it for ages 17+. The game includes violence, sexual content, and strong language. The mother was buying for her 9-year-old, which is way below the recommended age. The employee explained the content in detail, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker and others made a big deal about it, with some thinking it was a \"dick move,\" but the employee's intention was to inform the parent adequately.\n\nLegally and ethically, the employee isn't obligated to provide more information than the rating itself. However, the parent asked for more details, and the employee provided them. The employee's action was based on concern for the child's well-being, similar to how they would want someone to inform them if they were buying for their own kids. The mother made an informed decision after the explanation, which seems responsible.\n\nThe co-workers' mixed reactions don't necessarily validate the employee's wrongness. The employee wasn't pressuring the mother but was answering her questions truthfully. In many retail environments, employees are encouraged to provide accurate product information. Since the mother explicitly asked for more info, the employee's response was appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014protecting a young child from inappropriate content, acting in the parent's best interest by providing necessary details, and the parent using that info to make a choice\u2014it seems the employee did the right thing. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
