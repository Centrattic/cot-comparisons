I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who detailed graphic scenes in GTA V to a parent is in the wrong. The situation is that the parent wanted to buy the game for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating, including graphic content like torture, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The parent decided against it, and the co-worker was upset, thinking it was a \"dick move.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author's intention was to inform the parent about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate for a 9-year-old. The M rating is a clear indicator that the game is for mature audiences, so the author was probably just doing their job by providing accurate information. The parent's decision not to buy the game suggests that the information was useful and appropriate.\n\nNext, the co-worker's reaction. The co-worker is upset because the mother didn't buy the game. But the author's actions were about the child's safety and age-appropriate content. The co-worker might not realize the importance of adhering to content ratings, especially for young children. The author's actions align with what a responsible employee would do to ensure that customers make informed decisions, especially regarding minors.\n\nThe parent was \"naive,\" as the author mentions. This implies that the parent might not have been aware of the game's content. By providing detailed information, the author helped the parent make a better decision. The author isn't imposing their own values but giving factual information that the parent needs to decide for their child.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about wanting the same for their own kids (if they had any) makes sense. It's a common ethical stance to treat others as you would want to be treated. By giving the parent the necessary details, the author is fulfilling that principle.\n\nOn the other hand, could there be a case against the author? Maybe if the author was overstepping their role by being too detailed. But the M rating already indicates mature content, and the parent asked for more information. The author provided that information, which is part of their job in a retail setting. There's no indication that the author was rude or forced the parent into a decision; they just informed and let the parent decide.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author acted appropriately. They provided necessary information to help a customer make a responsible decision regarding their child's game purchase. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced here, as the author was acting in the best interest of the child and supporting the parent in making an informed choice.\n"
