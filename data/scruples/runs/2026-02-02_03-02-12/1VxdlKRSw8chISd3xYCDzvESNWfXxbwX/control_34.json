I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for persuading a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V for her 9-year-old son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author works at Target in electronics. A customer comes in wanting to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. He explains the M rating, mentions graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online aspect. The mother decides against it. His co-worker criticizes him for \"cockblocking,\" and others have mixed reactions. The author justifies his actions by saying he'd want similar info if it were his kids.\n\nNow, I need to determine if he's the asshole. Let's consider the key points. GTA V is rated M for Mature, which typically means it's for ages 17+. The game does have explicit content. The mother might not be aware of the specifics, so the author provided necessary information. The child is under 16, which is below the rated age. The author didn't force the sale but informed the mother, leading her to make an informed decision. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author is acting in the child's best interest by preventing access to inappropriate content. The co-worker's criticism seems short-sighted because it's about the child's well-being. The author isn't banning the game but providing facts. The mother's choice to buy a different game shows she valued the information. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author overstepped by being too graphic. However, the mother asked for more info, so he answered honestly. There's no indication he was rude or aggressive. His intent was to inform, not to judge. \n\nLegally, stores can sell M-rated games to minors, but there's a social responsibility to warn parents. The author is in a position to provide accurate info, which is his duty. The mixed reactions from coworkers might stem from discomfort with being honest about game content, but the right action is to inform parents.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. He provided necessary information to help a parent make a responsible decision, which aligns with protecting a child's well-being. The answer should be B (No).\n"
