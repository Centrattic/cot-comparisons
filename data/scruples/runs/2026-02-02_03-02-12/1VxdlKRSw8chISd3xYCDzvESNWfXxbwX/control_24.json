I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for discouraging a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old son. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author works in a store where they help customers buy video games. The mother wanted GTA V for her young son. The author explained the M rating and detailed the graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but others had mixed reactions.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author provided accurate information about the game's content, which is age-inappropriate. The mother was not aware of these details and appreciated the information. By informing her, the author helped her make an informed decision. The ESRB rating system is in place for a reason, and games rated M are not suitable for children under 17. The author's actions align with responsible consumer advice, protecting the child from inappropriate content. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about the mother's son not getting the game he wanted, not about the appropriateness of the content. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they were fulfilling their role as an informed employee, helping a customer make a decision that's in the best interest of her child. There's no indication that the author overstepped; they simply provided necessary information. The mother's decision to buy a different game shows she valued the advice. So, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
