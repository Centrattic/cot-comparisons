I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Ask the Adults\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong for discouraging a mother from buying Grand Theft Auto V for her 9-year-old son. The author detailed the game's graphic content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized this as \"videogame cockblocking,\" and there's a mixed reaction from other coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother is buying a game for her 9-year-old, and GTAV has an M rating (for Mature audience). The author explained the content, which includes violence, sexual themes, and swearing. The mother decided against it after being informed. The co-worker's issue is that he wanted the son to get the game, but the author intervened.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author did the wrong thing. From a parental responsibility angle, the mother has the right to make informed decisions about what her child consumes. The author provided factual information about the game's content, which is relevant to the mother's decision. The M rating is a warning, but the author went further to explain specific elements, which might not be part of the standard rating description. \n\nHowever, the co-worker's argument is that the author overstepped by being too explicit. But the mother asked for more information, so the author answered truthfully. The author's intention was to help the mother make a responsible choice, which aligns with protecting the child from inappropriate content. \n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't obligated to provide such details, but choosing to do so doesn't make them wrong. The mother might not have known the specifics, and the author's role as an employee is to assist the customer with accurate information. The co-worker's frustration stems from personal preference, but the author's action was in the best interest of the child's well-being.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author acted appropriately by informing the mother, thus supporting her in making a responsible purchasing decision. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
