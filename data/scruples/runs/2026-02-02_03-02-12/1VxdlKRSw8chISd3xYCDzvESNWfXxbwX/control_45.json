I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation was in the wrong. The scenario involves an employee at Target advising a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The employee explained the M rating, graphic content, and the mom decided against it. The co-worker and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. GTA V is an M-rated game with explicit content. The employee provided information about the game's content to help the parent make an informed decision. The parent was the one who made the final choice, so the employee wasn't forcing her to do anything. The employee's actions were in line with their job to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material.\n\nBut wait, some might argue that the employee overstepped by actively discouraging the purchase. However, the parent asked for more information, and the employee gave it honestly. The parent then decided not to buy it, which is her right. The employee isn't responsible for the game's content, just for providing accurate information.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism seems to stem from a different view on freedom of choice, but the employee's primary duty is to assist the customer, which includes informing them about content they might find objectionable. The employee's own stance is that they would want similar information if they were a parent, which is a reasonable perspective.\n\nIn terms of company policy, it's possible that the employee wasn't violating any rules by giving honest information. There's no indication they pressured the customer or acted unprofessionally beyond explaining the game's content. So, the employee was acting in the customer's best interest based on the parent's request for more details.\n\nTherefore, the employee isn't in the wrong because they provided necessary information for the parent to make a decision, which is a standard part of customer service, especially in electronics or gaming retail where content ratings are significant.\n"
