I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a Target employee who helped a mother decide against buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. The game has an M rating, which typically means it's for mature audiences. The author explained the game's content, including graphic scenes, sexual themes, and swearing, which led the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker called this \"videogame cockblocking\" and others had mixed reactions.\n\nFirst, consider the legal aspect. Retailers aren't legally obligated to give such detailed info, but they can. The mother was asking for more information, so the author was just providing what the customer requested. There's no law against giving accurate information about product content. \n\nEthically, the author's actions seem to be in the interest of the child's well-being. Parents have a responsibility to make informed decisions about what their kids consume. By giving the mother the details, the author helped her make a more informed choice. The ESRB ratings are in place for a reason, and the M rating is a clear indicator. The author was just reinforcing that rating with specifics.\n\nThe co-worker's reaction might be based on a different perspective, perhaps seeing it as interfering with the customer's decision. But the author didn't prevent the sale; they provided information and the mother made her own choice. The author's action aligns with the principle of informed consent. The mother might not have been aware of the specifics, and now she knows. \n\nAnother angle: some people might argue that the employee overstepped by giving such graphic details. However, the mother explicitly asked for more information, so the author was responding to her inquiry. It's not like the author volunteered the information without being asked. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about wanting the same treatment for their own kids (if they had any) is a valid point. It's a common ethical stance of doing unto others as you would have done unto you. The author is acting in a way they believe they would want in a similar situation. \n\nIn terms of retail policy, unless there's a specific rule against discussing game content, the author is within their rights. The M rating is a public piece of information, and the game's content is part of its description. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author didn't do anything wrong. They provided accurate information that the customer asked for, helping her make a better decision. The co-worker's criticism seems misplaced, and the author's actions were ethical and helpful.\n"
