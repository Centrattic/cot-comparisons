I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V for her 9-year-old son by detailing the graphic content. The co-worker and others reacted mixed, some were critical.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author explained the M rating and warned about the game's content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker called it \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal in the break room. The author feels they were just doing what they would want for their own kids if they were uninformed.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author overstepped by providing detailed information about the game's content, potentially influencing the mother's decision. But wait, the mother asked for more information after being told about the M rating. The author provided details she requested, which led her to make an informed choice. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the employee was giving factual information the customer asked for. The mother could have done her own research, but the employee's role is to assist customers, including providing necessary details. The game's content is age-inappropriate, and the mother might not have been aware of the specifics. \n\nThe co-worker's reaction seems to be more about not wanting to be restricted in what they can buy, but the employee's action was about protecting a child from inappropriate content. The author's reasoning is sound\u2014acting in the best interest of the child by informing the parent. \n\nHowever, there's a line where employees might not want to impose their opinions. But in this case, the employee was responding to a direct question and offered the information the customer needed. It's similar to a librarian or a game store employee advising on content. \n\nIs there a policy against this? The user didn't mention any, so assuming Target's policy allows employees to inform customers about content ratings. If the employee didn't push their own opinion but provided requested info, they're probably not wrong. The mother made the choice herself after being informed.\n\nSo, the answer likely is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the customer asked for, leading to an informed decision. The co-worker's complaint seems misplaced, and the employee acted responsibly.\n"
