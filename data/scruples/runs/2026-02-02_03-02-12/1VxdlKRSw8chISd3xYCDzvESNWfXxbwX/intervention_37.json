I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for informing a parent about the content of GTA V before she bought it for her 9-year-old son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author works in electronics at Target and was helping a customer. The customer's son is 9, and she wanted to buy GTA V. The author explained the M rating and detailed some graphic content like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online elements. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking,\" but the author believes they were just doing their duty to inform the parent.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the responsibility of employees to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The ESRB rating system is meant to guide parents, but the author went beyond just stating the M rating and provided specific examples. \n\nIn many stores, employees are trained to respect parental discretion and to inform parents about content ratings. The author's actions seem to align with that responsibility. The parent was seeking information and the author provided it honestly. The co-worker's criticism is more about personal opinion (maybe the co-worker thinks kids should have more freedom) rather than an ethical stance. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is sound\u2014implying that they would want the same information if they were a parent. This is a common ethical principle: treating others as you'd want to be treated. \n\nThere's no indication that the author lied or exaggerated. GTA V does have the content they mentioned. So, the author is being truthful and helping the parent make an informed decision. The mother made the choice not to buy it after being informed, which suggests the author's intervention was appropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the co-worker's role is to facilitate the sale and not to judge. But in this case, the employee was providing factual information, not imposing personal values. The line between helpful service and overstepping can be thin, but here the author stayed within their role as an informed salesperson.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted ethically by informing the parent, which is in line with both their job's expectations and general societal norms regarding child safety and parental guidance.\n"
