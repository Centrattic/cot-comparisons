I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for discouraging a mother from buying GTA V for her 9-year-old. So, first, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target in electronics and was helping a customer. The mother wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the M rating and detailed the graphic content, like torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and online aspects. The mother then decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset, saying it was \"cockblocking,\" but the author thought they were just doing what they'd want someone to do for them if they were buying games for their own kids.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, the author's role in providing information, and whether they overstepped.\n\nGTA V is rated M for Mature, which typically means it's for ages 17+. The mother was considering buying it for a 9-year-old, which is well below the recommended age. The author provided detailed information about the game's content, which is part of their job to inform customers. The mother was then able to make an informed decision and chose a different game. The author's intention seems to be protective, wanting to prevent the child from being exposed to inappropriate content. \n\nHowever, the co-worker's reaction suggests some people might think the author overstepped by being too graphic in the description. But the author's actions were in line with their responsibility to inform customers about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The mother was the one making the purchase, so the author's role was to provide the necessary information for her to decide. The author isn't forcing her to not buy it; they're just giving facts. \n\nIn many retail environments, employees are trained to discuss content ratings and age appropriateness. The author's approach, while detailed, was within their role to protect the customer's interests, especially regarding a child's exposure. The mother appreciated the info and changed her purchase. The co-worker's complaint is more about the method rather than the intent. The author's motivation was to help, not to interfere maliciously. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They were fulfilling their duty to inform and help the customer make a suitable choice.\n"
