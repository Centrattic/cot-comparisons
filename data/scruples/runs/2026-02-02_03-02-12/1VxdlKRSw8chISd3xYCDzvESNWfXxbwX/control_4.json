I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is presented in the format of an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author works at Target and was helping a customer buy a video game for her 9-year-old son. The customer asked for more information about Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV), which has an M (Mature) rating. The author detailed the graphic content, including torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing, and the online component. The mother decided not to buy the game after this information. The co-worker criticized the author for \"cockblocking\" and made a big deal about it in the break room. The author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nI should consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, stores are required to respect the maturity ratings of games and may not be allowed to sell certain rated games to minors. However, in the U.S., for example, a store isn't typically required to refuse a sale based on the rating unless there's a specific law in a state. But more importantly, the focus here is on whether the author overstepped.\n\nEthically, the author is acting as a responsible employee by informing the customer of the game's content. The customer was seeking information, so providing details about the M rating and content is appropriate. The author is helping the parent make an informed decision, which aligns with the parent's responsibility to make choices for their child's well-being. \n\nThe co-worker's criticism seems to come from a place of possibly thinking the author overstepped, but the author was just providing accurate information that the customer asked for. There's no indication that the author pressured the customer or went beyond what was necessary. The mother was the one who made the final decision, so the author isn't forcing her hand but giving her the facts.\n\nAnother angle is the role of the employee. The author's job is to assist customers, which includes providing information about products. The customer asked for more details, so the author fulfilled their role correctly. The author isn't in the wrong here because they were being helpful and responsible.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author shouldn't have gone into graphic details, but since the mother asked for more information, it's reasonable to elaborate. Also, the parent might have known the M rating but wanted specifics. The author is acting in the child's best interest, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary information that the customer requested, helping the parent make an informed decision. The co-worker's reaction is not justified, and the author's actions align with ethical responsibility.\n"
