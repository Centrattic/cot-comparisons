I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the GTA V story is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author works at Target in electronics. A customer, a mother, wants to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The author explains the M rating and the graphic content like torture, sex, swearing, and online aspects. The mother decides not to buy it after that. Then the co-worker criticizes the author for \"cockblocking,\" and there's a mixed response from others. The author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nI need to assess whether the author is wrong. The key points here are the responsibility of the store employee to inform customers about game content, especially for minors. GTA V is rated M, which stands for Mature, typically for 17+. The mother was buying for a 9-year-old, which is way under the recommended age. The author provided accurate information about the content, which led the mother to make a different choice. \n\nIn many places, there are laws about selling mature-rated games to minors. For example, in the US, stores can't sell R-rated movies or M-rated games to underage buyers. But here, the mother is buying for her son, so it's not a direct underage purchase. But the employee's role is to inform. The author's action was to give the mother all the necessary details so she can make an informed decision. That seems responsible, not wrong.\n\nThe co-worker's criticism is about overstepping, but the author's intention was to protect the child from inappropriate content. The author's reasoning is that they would want the same info if they were buying for their own kids. That's a reasonable perspective. The mixed responses from coworkers don't necessarily validate the co-worker's viewpoint. \n\nThe main issue is whether the employee crossed a line by being too detailed. However, since the mother asked for more information and the employee provided it, that's part of their job. The M rating is a warning, and explaining the content helps the parent understand why it's rated that way. So the author isn't wrong. They helped the mother make a better decision. The answer should be B (No).\n"
