I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Target employee who convinced a mother not to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old. The employee gave detailed info about the game's mature content, leading the mother to choose a different game. The co-worker criticized the employee for \"cockblocking\" the kid.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the roles here. The employee's job is to help customers make informed decisions. Providing information about a game's content, especially when the customer is concerned, seems like part of good service. The mother was worried and wanted more info, so the employee explained the M rating details. The employee didn't force her to not buy it, just informed her. The mother made the choice based on that info.\n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker argued it was a \"dick move.\" But the employee's intention was to help the parent make a responsible decision. The mother's son is 9, and GTA V is rated M for mature audiences. The employee is acting in the child's best interest by preventing exposure to inappropriate content. The employee's rationale is that if the mother were in their position, they'd want similar transparency.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law against informing customers about content. The employee didn't overstep by providing truthful information. The mother's decision was her own, so the employee isn't responsible for the child's access to content. The co-worker's criticism seems based on a different view of the employee's role, maybe thinking the employee should just process the sale without judgment.\n\nSo, the employee isn't in the wrong. They provided necessary info to help a parent make a choice. The answer should be B.\n"
