I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves an employee at Target who convinced a mother not to buy Grand Theft Auto V for her 9-year-old son, citing the game's mature content. The co-worker was upset about it, and the author is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were appropriate. The key points here are the age of the child, the content of the game, and the employee's role in advising the parent. The game has an M rating (for Mature), which generally means it's intended for ages 17 and up. The employee mentioned graphic scenes, swearing, and sexual themes, which are definitely not suitable for a 9-year-old. The mother was seeking information, and the employee provided it, leading the mother to make a different purchase. \n\nThe employee's motivation seems to be in good faith, trying to protect the child from inappropriate content. They compared their actions to how they would want someone to inform them if they were buying a game for their own kids. The employee didn't force the mother not to buy the game; they provided information and let her decide. The mother ultimately chose not to buy GTAV after being informed.\n\nHowever, the co-worker's reaction and the mixed responses from others suggest that some might see the employee's actions as overstepping. But in most places, employees are allowed to provide factual information about product content, especially when it comes to age-appropriate material. The employee didn't violate any company policy by giving accurate information. The mother was the one making the purchase decision, and the employee helped her make an informed choice.\n\nOn the other hand, could there be a case where the employee was wrong? Maybe if they had pressured the mother or made personal judgments beyond the facts. But in this case, the employee stuck to explaining the content and left the decision to the mother. The mother was grateful for the info and changed her purchase. \n\nSo, weighing the facts, the employee acted responsibly by providing necessary information to help the parent make a decision in the child's best interest. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
