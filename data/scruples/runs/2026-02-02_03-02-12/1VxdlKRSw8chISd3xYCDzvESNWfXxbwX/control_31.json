I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they work at Target, and a customer wanted to buy GTA V for her 9-year-old son. The author explained the game's mature content, which led the mother to decide against it. The coworker was upset, but the author thought they were helping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game has an M (Mature) rating, which means it's intended for ages 17+. GTA V is known for its violent and sexual content, which isn't appropriate for younger kids. The author provided information about the game's content to the mother, who then made an informed decision not to buy it. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author overstepped by giving too much detail. The mother asked for more information, so the author gave her specifics about the graphic scenes. The author's intention was to help the mother make a responsible choice for her child. \n\nNow, some might argue that the author shouldn't have given such detailed descriptions of the game's content, maybe thinking it's unnecessary. But the mother was asking, so it's part of the job to inform customers about the product's content. Retail employees are often expected to provide accurate information about what they're selling, especially when it comes to age-appropriate content. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker felt that the author was being a \"dick\" by not letting the sale happen. But the author's action was based on concern for the child's exposure to inappropriate material. The author isn't forcing the decision, just providing information. The mother still had the choice to buy or not. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's a duty to inform customers about the content that might affect their decision, especially regarding minors. The author didn't prevent the sale; they gave the mother the facts to decide. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Their actions were responsible and aimed at protecting a child from inappropriate content.\n"
