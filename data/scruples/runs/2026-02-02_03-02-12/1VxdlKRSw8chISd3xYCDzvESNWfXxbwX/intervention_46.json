I work in electronics. Today, my co-worker was with me while I was helping a guest buy a videogame for her son. She said her son was 9 years old, and wanted GTAV. I explained the M rating on the game, and asked her if it was okay, and she asked for more information. I explained that the game has a graphic torture scene as well as a plethora of sexual themes and moments, intense swearing/language, as well as the online aspect of GTAV. After my explanation, the mother was concerned and decided NOT to buy her son GTA V, and instead bought a different game.\n\nAfter the sale, my co-worker asked me why I was \"videogame  cockblocking\" her son. He said it was kind of a dick move, but 'you do you' he said. He made a big deal about it in the break room with a few fellow coworkers, and they gave a pretty mixed response.\n\nI just don't know if I was the asshole for convincing that mother not to buy GTA V for her son, but to rather go with a different game.\n\nthe way I see it, if I went in to buy a game for my kids (which I don't have), and it was a game I knew literally NOTHING about, I'd want to be informed of the game's content to help me determine if my kids should or shouldn't be playing that game. I was doing what I'd want done for me.\n\nTL;DR- I convinced a naive mother *not* to buy GTAV for her 9 year old.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they worked at Target and helped a mother buy a video game. The child is 9, and the mother wanted GTA V, which is rated M for mature. The author explained the content\u2014torture scenes, sexual themes, swearing\u2014and the mother decided not to buy it. The co-worker was upset about it, calling it \"videogame cockblocking.\" The author's defense is that they were just providing information to help the parent make an informed decision, which they would want for their own kids.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, consider the ethical angle. The author is acting in the best interest of the child by informing the parent about the game's content. Parents are responsible for their children's media consumption, and the author is helping them make a responsible choice. The author isn't forcing the parent; they're giving information. The M rating is there for a reason, and the author is just explaining what that rating entails. \n\nOn the other hand, the co-worker might see it as overstepping, but the author was doing their job to inform the customer. The parent asked for more information, so the author provided it truthfully. There's no indication that the author was being malicious or rude. The parent chose not to buy the game after being informed, which suggests the author's intervention was effective and appropriate.\n\nThe key points here are the responsibility of the parent, the author's role in providing necessary information, and the appropriateness of respecting the parent's decision. Since the author didn't do anything outside their role and was acting ethically, they are not in the wrong. The co-worker's reaction seems to be more about disagreeing with the decision rather than the author doing something wrong. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
