I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who's been having packages delivered. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid the doorbell ringing and startling her baby. She tried different methods, including notes in the delivery instructions, but people kept knocking. Then she made a sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered food last night, the delivery person just left it at the door without knocking. The food was cold when they realized it, and now the husband says they were asking for it. The author feels common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to protect their baby from being startled by knocks. They tried multiple ways to communicate this, but people didn't follow. The sign with logos worked for packages, but maybe the delivery person for the food didn't realize it was supposed to be left at the door. The problem here is that the food delivery might not be the same as package deliveries. Packages can be left safely, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be handed over quickly. The author expected the delivery person to knock and wait until they got the food, but the sign made them leave it at the door. \n\nWait, but the sign said \"Do not Knock\" for packages. The delivery person followed that instruction literally, leaving the food at the door. But food isn't a package; it's perishable and needs to be handed over. The author might have assumed the sign applied to all deliveries, but the delivery person might have thought it only applied to packages. The author didn't specify that the sign was for packages only. So maybe the author is at fault for not clarifying that the sign was only for packages, not food deliveries. On the other hand, the delivery person might have used common sense and knocked regardless. But the sign said not to knock, so they followed the instruction. The author's husband thought they were asking for it, which suggests that maybe they should have made a different sign for food. \n\nBut the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which they did successfully for packages. The food delivery was an oversight in the sign's scope. The author might not be in the wrong because they had a valid reason to avoid knocks for the baby. However, not specifying that the sign was only for packages could lead to misunderstandings. But the delivery person might have known the difference between packages and food and still followed the sign. So maybe the delivery person is at fault for not using common sense. The author's main issue is that the sign worked too well, leading to an unintended consequence. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the sign's instructions were clear enough. Since the sign had pictures of couriers and said \"Do not Knock,\" maybe it's implied for all deliveries, but food requires different handling. The author might not be in the wrong because their intention was to protect their baby, and the delivery person should have used judgment. So the answer would be B (No). But there's a counter-argument that the author didn't specify. Hmm. The user's husband said they were asking for it. The author's reasoning is that common sense should have prevailed. So the author thinks the delivery person should have knocked despite the sign. If the sign was for packages, but the delivery was food, maybe the delivery person should have knocked. But the sign didn't specify. The author's mistake was not being clear about which deliveries the sign applied to. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not clarifying. But the author tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not Knock\" in various ways. The sign might have been the only effective one. The delivery person might have misunderstood. In that case, the author isn't entirely at fault. The delivery person should have used common sense. So I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
