I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has been dealing with delivery people knocking on the door despite her clear instructions not to. She set up signs and notes in the order comments, but they were ignored. Eventually, she created a sign that worked, but when it came to a food delivery, the person just left it at the door and it got cold. She's wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author wanted to avoid knocks because she's a new mom, maybe dealing with a baby, so constant knocks might be disruptive. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through signs and order notes. The problem is that the delivery people didn't follow those instructions. Then she found a sign that worked (probably a \"No Knock\" sign with logos), but in the case of the food delivery, the person didn't knock and left it outside, leading to the food being cold.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTo determine this, consider both sides. The author made her wishes clear, but the delivery person might not have considered that leaving a cold food is also a problem. The sign might have been effective for packages, but food deliveries are different because they're time-sensitive and need to be warmer. The delivery person might have followed the sign literally by not knocking, but didn't use common sense to check if the delivery was appropriate. On the other hand, the author did try to communicate her preferences multiple times, and the sign was effective for other deliveries. The issue here is that the solution worked too well, causing an unintended problem with the food.\n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks they should have known the sign might apply to food too. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed. Common sense would imply that the delivery person should have realized leaving food at the door isn't suitable, even if the sign says not to knock. However, maybe the delivery person was following the sign strictly without thinking. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author set up the sign to prevent knocks, which she had a right to do given her situation. The delivery person's failure to use judgment in this specific case (food vs. packages) might be their fault. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting up the sign, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since she made her instructions clear and the sign was effective, but the delivery person didn't adapt, the fault might lie with the delivery person. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
