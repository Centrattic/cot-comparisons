And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a new mom who has a lot of packages delivered. She's been putting up signs that say \"Do not Knock\" and also specified that in delivery notes, but people kept knocking anyway. Then she got a sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person just left it at the door, which was cold when they got home. Now she's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The main issue is whether expecting the delivery person to not knock and leave packages at the door is reasonable. She's a new mom, so maybe she's busy and doesn't want to be disturbed for every delivery. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference, and the sign worked for packages but not for food. The problem with the food is that it was left outside and got cold because she wasn't there to receive it immediately. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. When she ordered packages, she specified \"Do not knock,\" which is a way to prevent delivery people from ringing the doorbell or knocking if she's not home. That makes sense for packages because you want them left at the door. But when she ordered food, the delivery person might have followed the same instruction, but food is different because it needs to be delivered hot, right? So maybe the sign that worked for packages didn't account for perishable items like food. The delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold, which was not ideal.\n\nNow, the author expected the delivery person to exercise common sense, but maybe her signs were too general. If she had a sign that said \"Leave packages at the door if no one answers,\" but didn't specify that food should be handled differently, then the delivery person might not know to treat food differently. So the problem is that her instructions were clear for packages but not for food deliveries. She might have assumed the delivery person would know that food needs to be handed over immediately or kept warm, but the sign didn't make that clear. So in this case, the author might have been overreaching by using the same sign for both types of deliveries without adjusting the instructions for food. That could be why the delivery person followed the same procedure, leading to the cold food.\n\nOn the other hand, she tried to communicate her preferences clearly and the sign worked for packages. Maybe she didn't realize that different types of deliveries require different handling. The delivery person might not have been able to distinguish between a package and a food order just by looking at the sign. So maybe the sign was ambiguous, and the delivery person did what was instructed without realizing the food needed special handling. In that case, the author's sign might have been too broad, leading to an unintended consequence. So, she might not be entirely wrong, but perhaps she could have been more specific about food deliveries.\n\nBut then again, as the customer, she has the right to specify her delivery preferences. However, if she's asking for something that's not feasible (like not knocking for food deliveries which require immediate handoff), then she might be in the wrong. The delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered hot and on time. If she's asking them not to knock, they might not be able to contact her if there's a problem. So maybe the delivery person followed her instructions literally but didn't account for the practical aspect of food delivery. In that case, the author's request was reasonable for packages but not for food. So she's partially at fault for not specifying different instructions for different types of deliveries.\n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense and realized that food can't just be left at the door. But if the sign specifically said \"Do not knock,\" maybe the delivery person thought they had to leave it there regardless. The author's husband said they asked for it, implying that by not knocking, they caused the problem. So the question is whether the author's request was reasonable for food. Since food requires immediate delivery, not knocking might not be feasible, so maybe she's in the wrong for applying the same rule to both packages and food.\n\nI think the key here is that the author set up the sign for packages, which makes sense, but applied it to food without considering the different requirements. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not making a distinction in her instructions. The delivery person followed the given instructions, but the outcome was unintended. So the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't specify different handling for food, leading to the problem. However, some might argue that the delivery person should have used common sense. But the sign was clear, so they followed it literally, which caused the issue. So the author's instructions were followed, but the result was undesirable. Therefore, the author might share responsibility for not considering that food delivery is different from packages.\n"
