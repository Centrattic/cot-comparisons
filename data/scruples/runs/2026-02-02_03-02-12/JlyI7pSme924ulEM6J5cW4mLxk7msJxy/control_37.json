I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who placed signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with courier logos that worked too well\u2014when they delivered food, the person didn't knock and left it at the door, which was ice cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, the user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author put up signs and notes to prevent knocking, which the delivery people ignored. She then used a sign with courier logos to make it clear, which worked for packages. However, when a food delivery happened, the courier followed the sign's instruction and left the food outside, leading to it being cold. The author is upset because the food was supposed to be delivered to the door, not left outside. \n\nThe key here is that the sign was for packages, but food delivery might require different handling. The sign might not have been specific enough to differentiate between packages and food. The courier might have assumed it applied to all deliveries. The author didn't mention that the sign was for packages only, so the courier's action was based on the sign's instruction. \n\nIs the author at fault? She created a sign that was too broad, not considering that food delivery might need a person to be present. She expected the courier to use common sense, but the sign's instructions were clear, leading to the unintended consequence. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not specifying the sign's applicability. \n\nBut wait, the sign had courier logos, which might imply it's for their deliveries. If the food delivery is through the same service, the courier would follow the same instruction. However, food delivery usually requires a different handling (hot food needs to be handed over immediately). The author didn't specify that \"Do not knock\" was only for packages, so maybe she should have clarified. \n\nOn the other hand, the courier strictly followed the sign, which the author intended to prevent knocking for packages. She didn't expect it to affect food deliveries. The husband said they were asking for it, implying that they shouldn't have used a sign that could lead to this issue. The author's expectation might be unreasonable because the sign was too general. \n\nSo, the answer could lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't make the sign specific enough and didn't anticipate food delivery being affected. Alternatively, the courier should have used common sense, which leans towards B. \n\nBut the sign was effective in preventing knocking for packages, so maybe the courier didn't read the fine print or didn't realize the food delivery needed a different approach. The author's mistake was not specifying that the \"Do not Knock\" was for packages only. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
