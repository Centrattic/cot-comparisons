I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" for package deliveries because she didn't want the delivery people to knock, maybe because she's a new mom and needs quiet or has a baby. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes and delivery options, but the couriers kept knocking. So she made a sign with the logos of the delivery companies to make it clear. It worked for packages, but then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person followed the sign and left the food at the door, which was cold by the time they noticed. The husband says they were asking for it, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The signs were intended to prevent the delivery people from knocking, but they were also meant to apply to food deliveries. The problem is that the sign didn't specify that it only applied to packages, so the food delivery person followed the same instruction. The author expected that the sign would be followed, but when it came to food, the expectation might be different. Food deliveries usually require the delivery person to knock or ring the doorbell because the recipient is there to receive it immediately. Packages can be left at the door without knocking. By not differentiating between package and food deliveries, the author's sign caused the food to be left unattended, leading to it being cold. The delivery person followed the instructions given, which the author provided. The author might have assumed that the sign's instructions were only for packages, but the delivery person followed them literally. So, the author's mistake was not clarifying that the sign applied only to package deliveries, not food. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering that different types of deliveries might require different handling. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
