I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting a food deliverer not to knock on the door, which caused the food to be left outside in the cold.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but the delivery people kept knocking. So she created a sign with courier logos to indicate where to leave packages. It worked for packages but then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it was late and cold.\n\nThe key points here are: she's trying to accommodate deliveries without being disturbed, especially as a new mom, which might mean she's busy with a baby. The signs were meant to prevent knocking, which she had issues with before. When it comes to food delivery, maybe she expected the same rules as packages. But the delivery person didn't knock and left it outside, which resulted in the food being cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The problem is that the sign was for packages, not food delivery. Food deliveries might require someone to answer the door to ensure it's placed safely, especially if it's something that needs to be handed over. However, she might not have considered that food delivery instructions could be different. Alternatively, the delivery person should have checked if there were specific instructions for food, even if the sign was for packages. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. She took steps to prevent knocking for packages, but food might need a different approach. Maybe she should have specified in the delivery notes for the food order not to knock, but she might have assumed the same sign applied. On the other hand, the delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was to leave it at the door, hence the cold food. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the sign was intended for all deliveries or just packages. If the sign was only for packages and she didn't specify for food, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she expected all deliveries to follow the same rule without clear distinction, that could be an issue. Since the sign includes \"Do not knock\" for various couriers, maybe it's a general instruction, but food delivery might need a different handling. \n\nIn that case, the author might be in the wrong for not specifying different instructions for food. Or maybe not, because the sign was clear and the delivery person followed it. The problem is that food usually requires someone to receive it. So the delivery person might have thought, \"Well, the sign says not to knock, so I'll leave it outside.\" But that's not practical for food. The author might have failed to communicate that different deliveries need different handling. So maybe she's in the wrong for not making that distinction clear. But then again, the delivery person could have used common sense, like knocking quietly or checking for a note. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she was trying to prevent knocking for all deliveries and the sign worked as intended. The delivery person followed the instructions, even if it had unintended consequences. But maybe the food delivery should have been handled differently. However, since the sign was there, the delivery person followed it, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used better judgment. But the question is about the author's responsibility. If she didn't specify for food, perhaps she's not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
