I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author is a new mom dealing with a lot of packages. She's had to put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because previous deliveries were being left at the door when she wanted someone to knock. She tried different methods, including writing notes in delivery options, but they were ignored. So she created a sign with courier logos that worked for packages but caused a problem when used for food delivery. The food was left at the door, got cold, and now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. As a new mom, she's probably dealing with a lot of stress and the need for convenience. Packages are frequent, and she wants them left at the door to avoid someone hanging around. But when ordering food, the expectation is usually that the delivery person will knock or call to ensure the food is handed over hot and fresh. The sign she made was effective for packages but not appropriate for food.\n\nThe key points here are the different expectations between package delivery and food delivery. Packages can be left at the door, especially if the recipient is not home, but food is perishable and needs timely handling. By using the same sign for both, she might have confused the delivery person. The sign's effectiveness for packages doesn't translate to food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which led to the food being left too long and getting cold. \n\nThe author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she had issues with before. However, she didn't consider that food delivery has different requirements. The problem arises from using a one-size-fits-all solution without accounting for the different contexts (packages vs. food). The delivery person acted on the instructions given by the sign, so the fault might not be entirely on them. But the author might be in the wrong for not realizing that the sign would affect food deliveries differently.\n\nHowever, maybe the author isn't at fault because she was trying to solve a problem she had with previous deliveries. The sign worked for packages, so she might not have anticipated it causing issues with food. It's a misunderstanding of how different delivery types are handled. The delivery person should have used common sense to knock for food, even if the sign said not to. \n\nBut then, the sign was clear, and the delivery person followed it. If the sign's instructions were too broad, maybe the author should have specified exceptions. However, the sign's purpose was to prevent knocking, which she had a valid reason for. The main issue is that food delivery requires a different approach. So, is the author at fault for not considering that, or is the delivery person at fault for following the sign too literally?\n\nIn the end, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she had a right to, but she might have overlooked the specific needs of food delivery. The delivery person followed the sign, but maybe they should have used judgment. However, the sign was explicit, so the delivery person acted on it. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" might be harsh. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting someone to follow instructions meant for packages, but she might have made a mistake in not differentiating between delivery types. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong, because she was trying to address a problem she had with previous deliveries and the sign worked for packages. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but maybe they should have used common sense for food delivery. The fault isn't entirely hers.\n"
