I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" because she probably wants to avoid the hassle of answering the door, maybe with a baby around. But the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So she changed the sign to one with corporate logos, which worked for packages\u2014no knocking there.\n\nThen, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person saw the sign and left it at the door. The food was cold when they noticed. The user is upset because she expected the food to be handed to her, not left outside, leading to it being cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points are her signs and the delivery person's actions. The original signs were for packages, not food. Food delivery usually requires handing it over, not leaving it at the door. The user might not have considered that the sign applies to food too, but she might have intended it for all deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign literally, which worked for packages but not for food. \n\nIs she wrong? Well, she didn't specify that the sign was only for packages. The delivery person probably followed the instructions given, which were to not knock. Since food delivery typically requires handing it over, the person might have expected that, but the sign didn't specify. The user's expectation that the delivery person should use common sense to distinguish between packages and food might not be the delivery person's responsibility. So maybe she's in the wrong for not clarifying the sign's scope. But another angle is that the delivery person should know the difference. Hmm.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the sign was ambiguous. If it just said \"Do not Knock\" without specifying, the delivery person might apply it to all deliveries. However, food delivery usually involves handing over the item, so expecting them to leave it at the door might be unreasonable. The user's problem is that the sign didn't differentiate between package and food. So she might be at fault for not making her instructions clear enough. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
