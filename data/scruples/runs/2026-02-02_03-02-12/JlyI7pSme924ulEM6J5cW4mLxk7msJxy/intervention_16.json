I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for package deliveries. She had multiple signs and notes in delivery options, but they kept knocking until she used a sign with corporate logos, which worked for packages but then caused an issue with a food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold because the delivery person didn't knock. The author is wondering if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main goal is to prevent people from knocking because she's a new mom, maybe dealing with a baby, and doesn't want the disturbance. She tried various methods to communicate this, but it wasn't respected until she used a sign with the company's logo. That worked for packages, but the food delivery person also followed the same instruction, leading to a problem.\n\nThe core issue is whether the sign's message was too broad. She intended it for packages, not food deliveries where the customer might expect someone to answer the door. The delivery person followed the sign literally, but that caused the food to be left out. The husband says they asked for it, implying that using the sign for all deliveries was their fault. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have known not to apply the sign to food which requires prompt attention.\n\nNow, considering the options. If the sign was ambiguous, maybe the author is partially at fault for not being clear. However, she had to use a specific sign with logos to get the package deliverers to comply, which suggests that general instructions weren't heeded before. Food delivery is different from packages; people usually need to be available for food as it's time-sensitive. The sign might not have made that distinction clear. The delivery person might not have known that food was an exception. Is the author responsible for the delivery person's misinterpretation, or is the delivery person responsible for using judgment?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about clear communication and reasonable expectations. The author's intent was to avoid disturbances, which is reasonable as a new parent. However, the method might have been too broad. She could have specified that the sign applies only to packages, not food. The delivery person, on the other hand, might have assumed the sign applied to all deliveries. But since the sign had specific logos, maybe the delivery person thought it was for all deliveries from those companies. The food delivery was late, but maybe that's the company's fault for not getting it on time. However, the author's sign caused the delivery to be left at the door, which led to the cold food.\n\nSo, the author's sign was effective for her main purpose (preventing knocks for packages) but had unintended consequences. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not anticipating that the sign might lead to food being left out. Since the sign didn't specify exceptions, maybe she's partially at fault. However, the delivery person also should have used common sense to check if the customer is home for food. The author did communicate her request, but maybe not clearly enough for all scenarios. \n\nIn AITA terms, the answer often depends on who had the burden of clear communication. If the author's sign was ambiguous, she might share some responsibility. But if the delivery person should have used judgment, then the delivery person is at fault. The author's intent was good, but the method might have been flawed. However, the husband's comment suggests they knew the risk when they put up the sign. The author might not be the asshole, but she could improve communication. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author's primary intent was reasonable, and the delivery person should have used common sense.\n"
