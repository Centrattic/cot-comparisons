I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions saying \"Do not knock.\" She had signs and notes in her orders, but they were ignored. Then she put up a sign with courier logos that worked, but when she ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door, making it cold.\n\nSo the question is, is the author at fault here? The user thinks she's not, but wants to know the opinion. The options are A for yes (she's wrong) and B for no (she's not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author repeatedly tried to communicate that she didn't want to be knocked on the door. She used signs and notes. The delivery person ignored those instructions. Then she put up a more visible sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but not for the food delivery. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction to leave it at the door, but that led to a problem because it was ice cold. The husband said they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable, especially as a new mom. She took steps to communicate her preferences. However, the food delivery situation is different from regular packages. Food requires immediate attention to stay warm. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions but didn't use common sense, which the author is upset about.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her needs, but maybe the sign was too broad, applying to all deliveries, not just packages. The food delivery person followed the sign, but the author didn't account for the difference in delivery requirements between packages and food. Maybe she should have specified that the \"do not knock\" applies only to packages, not food. But she didn't, and the sign didn't make that distinction. The delivery person followed the sign literally, which caused an issue. \n\nHowever, the author's main intent was to prevent disturbances, which is reasonable. The problem arose because the sign didn't specify exceptions. So, is the fault on the delivery person for not using common sense, or on the author for not clarifying the sign? \n\nIn these situations, the onus is usually on the person setting the instructions to be clear. If the sign didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries, then the author might share some responsibility. But considering she's a new mom, maybe she's overwhelmed and the sign was a necessary measure. The delivery person should have checked if the delivery type required immediate attention. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely at fault. The delivery person should have exercised judgment, but the sign could have been clearer. Since she's a new mom, her need for quiet is valid. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
