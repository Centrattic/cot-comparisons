I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting packages delivered and kept putting signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid the doorbell or knocking, which they found disruptive. They tried multiple times in the notes but didn't work. So they made a more visible sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages. Then they ordered dinner, and the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, resulting in cold food. The husband says they asked for it, but the author feels common sense should have been used.\n\nHmm. So the author's intent was to prevent knocking for packages, which they achieved, but when a food delivery came, they expected the person to knock. The sign said \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but the food delivery is different. The food delivery person might not have realized that the sign applied only to packages, not food. The author might not be in the wrong because the sign was specific to packages. However, maybe the sign didn't clarify that it was only for packages, leading to confusion. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was to not knock, so they left it at the door. The author's expectation was that the delivery person should use common sense to knock for food, not packages. But maybe the sign was too broad. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the sign didn't make it clear that the \"do not knock\" rule was only for packages, then the delivery person might have reasonably followed the sign's instruction regardless of the delivery type. However, the author's intention was to avoid the noise for packages, not for food deliveries where interaction is expected. So the author's expectations are reasonable, but the sign's wording might not have been specific enough. The author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their preference, but the delivery person followed the instruction as written. Alternatively, the author might have been too vague in their sign. \n\nI think the key here is that the sign said \"Do not Knock\" with courier logos, which might imply that for any delivery, but food is different. The delivery person likely followed the sign's instruction without considering the context. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting that the delivery person would use common sense to knock for food. The sign might not have been clear, but the author's intent was to prevent knocking for packages, not food. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
