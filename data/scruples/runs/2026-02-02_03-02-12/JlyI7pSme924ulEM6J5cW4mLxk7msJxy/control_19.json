I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's had issues before where people kept knocking even though she had signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" She tried various methods, including writing it in delivery notes and using a sign with courier logos. The sign worked for packages, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it on the door, which was ice cold because it was supposed to be a 45-minute late delivery. Now she's upset because the food was left outside instead of being kept warm.\n\nFirst, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. The sign was meant to prevent knocking, which she needed, maybe because she's a new mom and can't answer the door, or there's a baby inside. But food delivery is different from packages. Packages can stay outside, but food needs to be kept hot. The sign might not have been clear enough for food deliveries. She might have assumed that the sign applies to all deliveries, but maybe the delivery person couldn't tell the difference between a package and food. \n\nHer husband says they asked for it, implying that the sign was the problem. She argues that common sense should have been used. But common sense doesn't always apply if the sign didn't specify. The sign's main purpose was to prevent knocking for packages, but when a food delivery comes, the delivery person might not realize it's urgent. The sign might not have been clear enough. Also, maybe the delivery person didn't know that the food needed to be kept warm. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She had a legitimate reason to have the sign for packages, but maybe she didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. The sign's effectiveness for packages led her to not adjust for food, which is a different scenario. She might be in the wrong because she didn't account for the difference between packages and food. However, if the sign was supposed to be a general rule, maybe the delivery person should have used judgment. But given that the sign was effective for packages, perhaps she should have made a distinction. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person could have checked the sign and realized that food delivery needs to be handled differently, but maybe the sign was not explicit enough. The problem is that the sign was too broad. So maybe she's in the wrong for not considering that food delivery requires a different approach, hence the sign should have exceptions. Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong), but there's a nuance. However, the husband's point is that they asked for it by having the sign. The user's point is that the delivery person should use common sense, but common sense might not always be applied. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is A because she didn't account for the different needs of food delivery versus packages. The sign was too general, leading to the problem.\n"
