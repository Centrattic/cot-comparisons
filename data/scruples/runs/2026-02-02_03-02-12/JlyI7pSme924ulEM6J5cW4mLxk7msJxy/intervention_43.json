I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation involves the author, a new mom, who has multiple signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages because knocking startsle her, perhaps with the baby. She's tried various methods to communicate this, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then, she used a sign with the courier logos that worked for packages, but when used for food delivery, the delivery person just left it at the door without knocking, leading to a cold meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent here. The author's main issue is with people knocking, which is understandable, especially with a baby. She made every effort to communicate her preference, but it wasn't respected. Then, when she used the sign that worked for packages, it backfired with food delivery. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the same protocol for food as for packages, or if the delivery person acted appropriately by not knocking but leaving the food at the door.\n\nThe key points are: 1) She communicated her preference clearly with signs and notes. 2) The food delivery person followed the same sign but didn't adjust for the different context (food vs. packages). 3) The result was an issue with the food's temperature, which is a valid concern.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she had a legitimate reason to avoid knocking. However, maybe the sign was ambiguous in this context. Packages can be left at the door, but food delivery might require a different handling, like warm delivery. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction literally but didn't use common sense to adjust for the perishable item. \n\nBut the user argues that common sense should have prevailed. The husband said they were asking for it, which could imply that using the sign was too strict. However, the author's intention was to avoid knocking, which she had a right to. The delivery person might have misunderstood the sign's application. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the author made clear requests, but the delivery person's action, while following the sign, didn't account for the food's temperature. The author isn't wrong for wanting to avoid knocks, but maybe the sign's use for food delivery was a misstep. However, since the sign was effective for packages, it's unclear if the delivery person should have known to differentiate. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's use of the sign was reasonable. Since she had a valid reason and tried multiple times to communicate, it's more the delivery person's failure to use judgment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
