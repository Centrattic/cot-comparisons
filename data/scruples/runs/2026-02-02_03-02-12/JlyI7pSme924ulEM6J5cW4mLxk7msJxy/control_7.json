I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for expecting the delivery person to not knock, which led to the food being left outside and getting cold.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with lots of packages. She tried multiple times to specify \"Do not knock\" on signs and in delivery notes, but people kept knocking. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but not for food delivery. The food delivery person left it at the door, even though the sign said not to knock. Now, she's upset because the food was late and cold.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author clearly communicated her request not to knock. The food delivery person saw the sign but didn't follow it. Maybe the food delivery service is different from package services. Maybe the sign was intended for packages, not food. The delivery person might have assumed it applied only to packages. Also, food deliveries might require more urgent handling, so maybe there's an expectation to knock if the door is closed. But the author included the courier logos, which might cover food delivery as well. \n\nThe husband says they were asking for it. But the author argues common sense should have prevailed. The delivery person didn't knock, but the food was left outside, which made it cold. The author's main issue is that the delivery person didn't follow the instructions, leading to a bad outcome. However, maybe the sign was ambiguous. Also, the food delivery person might have thought that since the door was closed, they should leave it at the door to avoid keeping the food warm. But the sign said not to knock, which could imply leaving the package at the door, but not necessarily for food. \n\nThe key here is whether the sign's instructions were clear to all delivery types. If the sign was specific to packages and not food, the delivery person might not have realized they shouldn't knock for food. Alternatively, if the sign was general, then the delivery person should follow it. However, the sign had courier logos, so maybe the food delivery person isn't associated with those couriers. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author did her best to communicate, but maybe the delivery person had a different understanding. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she made her requests clear. The delivery person's mistake was not following the instructions, which isn't the author's fault. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
