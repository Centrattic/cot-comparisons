I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages. They put up signs that say \"Do not Knock\" both on a sign and in delivery notes, but people kept knocking anyway. Then they got this sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door, which was a problem because it was cold food and they didn't notice until it was too late.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're the asshole here. The husband says they were asking for it, but the user thinks common sense should have prevailed. The key points are about the signs and the delivery person's actions. The sign was meant to prevent knocking for packages, which they wanted left at the door because maybe they're home with a baby and don't want to be disturbed. But when it's food, especially something that needs to be hot or handled promptly, not knocking could be a problem if the delivery person can't confirm it's safe to leave it there.\n\nSo, maybe the user didn't consider that food deliveries are different from packages. Packages can just be left, but food might require a different handling. The user's sign probably didn't specify that it's only for packages, so the delivery person might have followed the same instruction for all deliveries. That could be why the food wasn't delivered properly. The user expected the delivery person to use common sense, like realizing that food needs to be handed over or at least checked if someone is home, but maybe the sign didn't leave room for that discretion.\n\nOn the other hand, the user did make the sign specific to the courier's logos, maybe to target the right service, but the delivery person still followed it literally. The user's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, but food delivery requires a different approach. The user might have been too rigid with the sign without considering the different types of deliveries. The husband's point that they were asking for it makes sense because the sign didn't account for the different handling of food.\n\nSo, in this case, the user's mistake was not differentiating between package and food deliveries in their instructions. The delivery person followed the sign as given, but the situation requires more nuance. Therefore, the user is partly at fault because they didn't consider the different contexts for deliveries. However, maybe the delivery person should have used judgment to handle food differently, but the sign's instructions were clear. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the user's instructions were followed as per the sign, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on them. Hmm.\n"
