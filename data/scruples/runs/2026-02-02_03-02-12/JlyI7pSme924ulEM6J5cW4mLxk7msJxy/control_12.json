I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of deliveries. She's had issues before where delivery people kept knocking despite her signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" So she made a new sign with pictures of the courier logos, which worked in stopping the knocking. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the front door, and it got cold.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The sign was meant to prevent knocking, which she wanted because maybe she's a new mom and needs quiet, or has kids, or something. But the consequence was that the delivery was left outside, leading to the food being cold. The delivery person didn't knock, so maybe they weren't aware that the delivery needed to be taken inside immediately. \n\nThe user is upset because the food was left outside, but she also had explicitly said not to knock. The delivery person might not have realized that the delivery wasn't just a package but food that needed to be handed over. The sign might have been too generic, targeting packages but not food deliveries. \n\nSo, is she at fault? She wanted no knocking, which the delivery person followed. But maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. Should she have made a distinction between packages and food? The husband says they were asking for it, implying that by not knocking, they caused the problem. But the user argues that common sense should have meant the delivery person would knock for food. \n\nFrom a rules standpoint, the delivery person followed the instructions given. But maybe the user didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. The sign's effectiveness in stopping knocking for packages might not apply to food, which is time-sensitive. \n\nSo, the user might share some responsibility for not clarifying that the no-knocking rule applies only to packages, not food. The delivery person did what was asked, but maybe the user's expectations were too broad. Therefore, she could be in the wrong, but it's a bit of a grey area. The answer might be A or B depending on interpretation. However, if the sign was specific to packages, then the user might be in the wrong for not making that clear. But since the sign had courier logos, maybe it was intended for all deliveries. It's a tough call. The key points are: the user wanted no knocking, the delivery person followed that, but the consequence was inconvenient. The user's sign might have been too broad. So maybe she's not entirely wrong, but she could have been clearer. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the delivery person ignored previous instructions, and the sign worked as intended, but the user didn't anticipate the food delivery scenario. Alternatively, if the sign was ambiguous, she might share some blame. But the main issue is the delivery person not using common sense, so the answer could be B.\n"
