I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs up saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which were ignored. Then she created a sign with courier logos that worked for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The food delivery person left a cold meal without knocking.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she tried multiple times. She used all available options to communicate this, including written notes and delivery instructions. The sign worked for packages, which was her goal. But when it came to food, the delivery person followed the sign and left it at the door, leading to a cold meal. \n\nNow, the key points here: Was her sign clear enough? The sign has specific courier logos, so maybe the food delivery person misread or didn't notice it. Or perhaps the sign was meant for packages, not food. The author expected food delivery people to knock, but the sign didn't specify that. However, she might not have considered that different services might interpret the sign differently. \n\nThe author's husband said they were asking for it, implying they should have known the sign would affect all deliveries. But the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. Did she overstep by making a sign that's too broad? Or is it reasonable to expect that food deliveries, which require more timely handling, would be treated differently? \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person should have used judgment. Even if the sign says \"Do not knock,\" if the item is perishable (like food), knocking to ensure timely delivery makes sense. The sign might not have been specific enough, but the delivery person should have assessed the situation. \n\nThe author's mistake might have been not differentiating between package and food deliveries in her sign. However, her primary issue was with packages, and she communicated that clearly. The food incident was an unintended consequence. So, is she in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but there's room for both perspectives. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author tried multiple times to communicate her request, and the delivery person should have used common sense. However, the sign's lack of specificity could be a point against her. But given the context, it's more about the delivery person's judgment than the author's fault.\n"
