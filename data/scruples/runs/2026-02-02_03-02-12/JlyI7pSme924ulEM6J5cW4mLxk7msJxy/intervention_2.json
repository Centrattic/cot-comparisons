I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door even though she put up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" She tried using a different sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but then caused a problem with food delivery. The food delivery person left the dinner on the doorstep, and it got cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she had a valid reason for\u2014maybe she's busy, a new mom, doesn't want to be disturbed. She tried multiple ways to communicate this, but it wasn't effective until the new sign. The problem came when the sign affected a food delivery that needed to be handed off, not left at the door. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally but didn't use judgment to realize that food requires a different handling.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, her signs were clear about not knocking for packages, which is reasonable. Food delivery might be a different context, but the sign didn't specify that. The delivery person might not have realized the difference. The author didn't intend to ignore food deliveries, but the sign was too broad. However, the delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered properly, which might require knocking. If the sign only said not to knock for packages, maybe the delivery person should have used their discretion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be responsible for not making the sign specific enough. Maybe she should have added a note for food deliveries. But she had tried writing notes in checkout carts and they were ignored, so she resorted to a visual sign. The sign's effectiveness for packages worked, but it didn't account for exceptions. The delivery person's mistake was following the sign too literally without considering the nature of the delivery. The author's husband says they asked for it, implying that the sign's instructions led to the problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author wanted to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable. The delivery person's failure to use common sense in this case is the main issue. The author's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, not for all deliveries. Therefore, the problem isn't with her for setting the rule, but with the delivery person for not adapting it to the context of a food delivery. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
