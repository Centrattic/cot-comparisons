I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has lots of packages delivered. She kept getting knocked on the door despite her \"Do not knock\" notes, so she created a sign to stop that. It worked for packages but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, which was ice cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent people from knocking, which she did through notes and a sign. That seems reasonable, especially if she's a new mom and needs peace. The sign was effective for packages, so she probably thought it was a good solution. The problem arose when the food delivery person followed the same instruction, but the food was supposed to be delivered to someone's hand, not left at the door. \n\nThe key here is the context. Packages can be left safely, but food, especially hot or perishable items, needs to be handed over to ensure quality. The sign didn't differentiate between packages and food, so the delivery person did what they were told, but it led to a bad outcome. \n\nIs the author at fault? She didn't specify that the \"Do not knock\" rule applies only to packages. The sign had logos of couriers, which might imply it's for all deliveries, including food. So maybe she didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. However, she was trying to solve a problem she had with package deliveries. \n\nThe husband's point is that they were asking for it, which suggests that the sign was too broad. The author's defense is that common sense should have prevailed. But in reality, the delivery person followed instructions literally without considering the nature of the delivery. \n\nSo, the author's sign was ambiguous. She might have been in the wrong for not clarifying that the \"Do not knock\" instruction was only for packages. However, her intention was to avoid disturbances, which is understandable. The delivery person's responsibility is to ensure the delivery is handled correctly, which might override written instructions if they're not in line with standard practices. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's sign was too general, leading to an unintended consequence. She might share some responsibility for not specifying the context. But the delivery person also has a duty to use judgment. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she created the sign without considering different delivery scenarios, Answer A might be appropriate. But given the context of her being a new mom dealing with many packages, maybe Answer B is better. Hmm, but the food delivery person should have known to check if the food needs to be handed over. The author's sign was specific to her request, but maybe it's the delivery person's fault. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she clearly said \"Do not knock\" for packages, but food delivery requires interaction, then maybe she's not in the wrong. The sign was for all couriers, but she might not have intended it to apply to food. But since she didn't specify, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer could be B, not in the wrong. Because she was following the same instructions as before, and the delivery person should have used common sense. The author's perspective is that common sense should have been used. So maybe B is correct.\n"
