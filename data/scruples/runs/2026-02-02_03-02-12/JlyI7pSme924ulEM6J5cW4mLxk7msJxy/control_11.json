I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a new mom who has a lot of packages delivered. She's had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" but the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So she created a new sign with the courier logos, which worked in that the delivery person didn't knock, but instead left the food at the door. However, the food was left outside for 45 minutes and got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which they achieved. The problem is that the delivery person left the food outside, leading to it being cold. The question is whether the author is at fault for expecting the delivery person to use common sense and not leave the food in a way that spoils it, even if the sign said not to knock.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is the delivery person's actions after not knocking. The sign said \"Do not knock,\" but maybe it didn't specify what to do instead. If the sign only says not to knock, it's possible the delivery person didn't know another appropriate method to leave the food. The author might have assumed that the delivery person would use their own judgment, but the sign didn't provide any alternative instructions. \n\nIs the author responsible for the delivery person's lack of common sense? Well, delivery people are expected to follow standard procedures. If the sign says not to knock, maybe the standard procedure is to leave the package at the door. However, for food deliveries, especially during cold weather or if the delivery is time-sensitive, leaving it unattended could be an issue. The author might have expected the delivery person to find another way, like using a secure location or contacting the recipient. \n\nBut the sign didn't provide any other instructions. The author's previous attempts to communicate \"Do not knock\" were ignored, leading her to create a more attention-grabbing sign. The problem is that the sign succeeded in preventing knocking but didn't address the method of delivery. The delivery person might not have known what to do instead, so they left it at the door, which is the standard method if no one is there. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be at fault for the delivery person's actions. The delivery person's job is to follow the recipient's instructions. If the instruction was \"Do not knock,\" and the delivery person didn't knock but left the food at the door, which is the usual alternative, then the delivery person followed the instruction. The author's fault might be not providing clear alternative instructions. However, the delivery person might also be expected to use common sense in such situations, especially with food deliveries. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" implies that by having the sign, they forced the delivery person into a position where they had to leave the food outside. But the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not anticipating that the delivery person would leave the food outside, leading to it being cold. If the author didn't provide any alternative instructions beyond \"Do not knock,\" then maybe she isn't at fault. The delivery person's job is to comply with the given instructions, even if those instructions are minimal. However, if the standard procedure for the courier company is to leave food at the door if no one is present, then following the instruction to not knock would naturally lead to that outcome. In that case, the author might be at fault for not realizing that the sign would lead to the delivery person following the standard procedure. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have found another way to communicate without knocking, but since the sign didn't specify, the delivery person might have just followed the default. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she achieved. However, the consequence was an unintended negative effect. The key is whether she should have foreseen that the delivery person would leave the food in a way that made it cold. If the author didn't provide any other instructions, it's not entirely her fault. The delivery person might have made a mistake in not using a more appropriate method, but the author's sign was clear on not knocking. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The delivery person's actions led to the cold food, but the author's sign was specific to not knocking. The issue is the delivery person's lack of alternative action, not necessarily the author's instructions. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
