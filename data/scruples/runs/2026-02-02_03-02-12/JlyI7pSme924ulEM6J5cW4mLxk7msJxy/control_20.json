I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she's a new mom with lots of packages, so she put signs saying \"Do not knock.\" She tried multiple times to communicate this, but the delivery people kept knocking. Then she got a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but caused an issue with a food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold. Her husband says they deserved it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. The key points are her attempts to prevent knocking, the effectiveness of the sign for packages, and the unintended consequence with the food. \n\nShe's a new mom, which adds context about her needing to manage deliveries without disturbance, especially for her baby. She made multiple signs and specified in delivery notes not to knock. The sign with the courier logos worked for packages, but when used for a food delivery, the delivery person didn't knock, leading to the food being left out and getting cold.\n\nThe delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction strictly, not realizing that a food delivery is different. The sign was intended for packages, not food. The author's intention was to minimize disturbances, which is understandable. However, the sign's effect on food delivery wasn't considered. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she tried to communicate her needs, but the method had an unintended consequence. The delivery person might have made an assumption based on the sign. The question is whether she should have anticipated that the sign would apply to food deliveries. Since the sign had courier logos, maybe it's a package-specific sign, so the food delivery person might not have realized it's different. \n\nHer husband's comment that they asked for it implies he thinks they should have known. But the author argues common sense should have prevailed. Common sense here could be whether the delivery person should recognize that food delivery requires immediate attention. However, the sign didn't specify \"for packages only,\" so the delivery person might not know. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author set up the sign to address package deliveries, which worked. The food delivery issue was an oversight. She might not be in the wrong because her intention was to prevent unnecessary knocks, but the sign's application wasn't clear. However, she could have considered the different needs for food deliveries. But since she didn't mention exceptions on the sign, the delivery person followed the instructions they had. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because she was trying to manage her needs as a new mom, and the error was on the delivery person's part for not discerning between package and food delivery. Alternatively, maybe she's a bit at fault for not clarifying the sign. But given the context, it's more about the sign's limitations rather than her being in the wrong. The delivery person should have used better judgment, not just follow the sign without considering the situation.\n"
