I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock after using a sign that worked for package deliveries.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom dealing with many packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but they were ignored. So she created a sign with courier logos, and it worked for packages. Then, when ordering food, which is a different service, the same sign made the delivery person not knock, leaving the food outside in the cold.\n\nNow, the key points here: She used the same sign for food delivery as she did for packages. The food delivery person saw the sign and left it unattended. The user is upset because the food was cold. Her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that common sense should have applied. But the problem is the sign was for package deliveries, not food. Food delivery typically requires more immediate handling, so the delivery person might not leave it unattended. However, the sign didn't specify package vs. food. The author's mistake was using the same sign for both, which led to the unintended consequence.\n\nBut considering she had tried multiple times to get the packages left without knocking, and the food delivery person might not make the distinction between package signs and food orders. The sign's effectiveness for packages might have been too broad. The author might be in the wrong because the sign didn't specify, leading to miscommunication. However, the delivery person should've knocked regardless of the sign if it's food. But maybe the delivery person followed the sign literally. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't specify the sign was only for packages. On the other, the delivery person should prioritize food delivery norms. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not differentiating. But the delivery person should use judgment. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the sign was for packages, but the situation shows the sign's effectiveness was too broad. However, the author might not be entirely at fault. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer could be B, as she tried to solve the problem but the sign had unintended consequences. The delivery person also should have used common sense. So maybe B.\n"
