I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby during package deliveries. She had various versions of these signs, including one with courier logos that worked for packages but then caused a problem with a food delivery.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent noise that could disturb her baby. She took steps to communicate her request clearly through multiple signs and delivery notes. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction, leaving the ice-cold meal at the door. The author is upset because the food was late and cold, but she expected the delivery person to use common sense instead of strictly adhering to the sign.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the situation: The sign had specific instructions, and the delivery person followed them. The author's problem is that the food wasn't delivered properly as a result. However, the sign was meant for packages, not food deliveries. The author might have assumed that the delivery person would recognize the difference, but the sign didn't specify that. The delivery person might not have known it was a food order, hence following the same instructions as for a package.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more specific in her signage, perhaps adding a note that food deliveries should still be knocked on. But since she used a sign with courier logos that were effective for packages, she might not have considered that it could apply to food as well. Her husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests that the sign's instructions were too broad. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person followed the given instructions, so they might not be at fault. The author's mistake was not considering that the sign could affect food deliveries differently. However, the main issue is that the sign worked as intended for packages but not for food, which she didn't anticipate. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She tried to communicate her needs, but the method had an unintended consequence. The delivery person did their job by following the instructions. The author's expectation that common sense would prevail might not be fair, as the delivery person can't be expected to read between the lines without explicit instructions. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not being specific enough, but it's not entirely her fault. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong, which is a yes/no choice. Given that the delivery person followed the instructions as given, the author's request was reasonable for packages, but the oversight with food deliveries suggests a minor flaw in her approach. Therefore, the answer is B (No), because she's not in the wrong, but the situation shows a need for clearer communication.\n"
