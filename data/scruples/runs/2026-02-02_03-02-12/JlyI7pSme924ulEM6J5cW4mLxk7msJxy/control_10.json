I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock on her door, probably due to not wanting to disturb her or maybe for safety. She tried various methods to communicate this, including notes on the packages and in delivery options. Eventually, she used a sign with courier logos that worked, but when a food delivery person left the food at the door, it got cold, and they were upset. Her husband thinks they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The user is trying to prevent knocks, which she's communicated clearly. The sign worked for packages but perhaps not for food. The delivery person in this case might have assumed they needed to knock because they're used to doing so, but the sign said not to. However, food delivery might require a different protocol. Maybe the delivery person didn't knock but just left it, but since it was food, it's expected to knock or confirm delivery. The issue here is that the sign was effective in preventing knocks for packages, but for food, maybe the delivery person didn't knock and just left it at the door, leading to the food getting cold. \n\nThe user's intention was to avoid knocks, which she communicated. The delivery person followed the sign, but perhaps misapplied it to a situation where knocking is necessary. The user is upset because the food was left out and got cold, but she also wanted no knocks. It's a conflict between her request and the delivery person's job protocol. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, she followed all the steps to communicate her request. The delivery person might have been following the sign but didn't use common sense for food. The user's husband thinks they asked for it, implying that she shouldn't have put up the sign. However, the user is arguing that common sense should have been used.\n\nLegally, if she asked not to knock, the delivery person might have complied, but there's a standard practice for food delivery. It's possible that the delivery person should have known to knock for food, even if the sign said not to. Alternatively, maybe the sign was too broad, and the delivery person shouldn't have left food without checking. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about expectations and communication. The user communicated her request clearly. The delivery person might have followed the sign but failed to adjust for the specific situation. The user might not be in the wrong because she made her wishes known, and the delivery person's actions led to the problem. However, the user's solution (the sign) might have been too absolute, not considering different types of deliveries. But since she was consistent, it's the delivery person's responsibility to adjust. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She communicated her request, and the delivery person didn't use common sense for a food delivery, which typically requires interaction. The husband's comment that they asked for it is misplaced because the sign was supposed to prevent knocks, but the delivery person misapplied it. The user isn't at fault here.\n"
