I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock instead of leaving the package. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been dealing with package deliveries and has put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby. But when they ordered dinner and put up a sign with courier logos (probably to indicate they want to knock), the deliverer left the food at the door without knocking. The food was cold when they noticed.\n\nFirst, the author tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" for packages, but the delivery people ignored it. So when ordering food, they used a different sign, maybe one that says \"Knock\" instead of \"Do not knock,\" which the deliverer followed. The problem is that the food was left at the door and got cold. The author is upset because they wanted the deliverer to knock, but the delivery person didn't realize they needed to check if someone was available to receive it immediately.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From the description, the author tried to adjust the sign to indicate knocking for this specific delivery (food), which is different from packages. The deliverer, following the sign, left it at the door. But the issue is that food deliveries typically require immediate handoff, so maybe the sign should have indicated that the person would be present. However, the author might not have considered that a food delivery is different from a package. The deliverer might have thought that since the sign was there, they could just leave it as per usual, not realizing that food needs to be handed over.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop knocks for packages, but when ordering food, they wanted the knock. The deliverer followed the sign correctly but possibly misunderstood the context. The author's husband says they were asking for it, implying that using the same sign for food was confusing. But the author might have thought that the different sign (with courier logos) would override the previous ones. It's a bit of a communication mix-up. The deliverer acted on the sign but didn't check if someone was available, leading to the cold food. So, the author isn't entirely at fault because they tried to adjust the sign for the specific delivery, but maybe they didn't communicate clearly enough to differentiate between packages and food. However, the deliverer should have ensured that the food was handed over properly. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
