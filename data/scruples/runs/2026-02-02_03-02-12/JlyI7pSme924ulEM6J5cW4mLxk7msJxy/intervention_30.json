I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock on the door, maybe because she's a new mom and needs to be quiet for the baby or something. She had signs and wrote notes in the delivery options, but people kept knocking. Then she switched to a sign with logos that worked, but the food delivery person left the package without knocking, and it was ice cold when they found it.\n\nSo, the author is upset because the food was left out too long, but she's also saying that the delivery person didn't use common sense. The AITA is asking if she's the ass (wrong) for expecting the delivery person to not knock. The possible answers are A for yes, she's wrong, or B for no, she's not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was to prevent knocks, which she had a valid reason for. She tried various methods, and the sign with logos worked too well. The delivery person followed the sign literally, but that led to the food being cold. The problem here is whether her sign was too ambiguous. Did the sign specify that food deliveries could still be left at the door? Or did it just say \"Do not knock\" in general, leading the delivery person to leave the food without any communication?\n\nIf the sign was too vague and didn't make an exception for food deliveries, then maybe the delivery person followed the rule to the letter without considering the context. The author might not have been in the wrong for putting up the sign, especially if she's a new mom needing to keep the baby quiet. However, maybe she should have clarified that the \"Do not knock\" applies only to packages, not food, or that food should be left in a specific place with a note. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person's job is to deliver the food properly, which usually involves contacting the recipient. If the sign didn't make that clear, the delivery person might have done their job by leaving the food at the door, assuming the recipient would come get it. But the food being left out for 45 minutes is a problem. However, maybe the delivery person didn't check if it was safe to leave it there and just followed the sign's instruction not to knock, which could be a misunderstanding.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to avoid knocks, which she had a right to do. However, the sign might not have been specific enough. If the sign said \"Do not knock for packages, but please confirm for food,\" that would be clearer. But since it didn't, the delivery person followed the sign as written. The author might not be in the wrong for putting the sign up, but maybe she should have been more specific. However, the delivery person should have used some judgment instead of just following the sign literally. \n\nAlso, the fact that the husband said they were asking for it might be their own perspective, but the author is questioning if she was in the wrong. The key point is whether the author's instructions were reasonable. If she had a valid reason not to be knocked on (like a baby), then her request is understandable. But the sign's effectiveness led to an unintended consequence because it was too broad. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. The problem was the sign's vagueness, and the delivery person should have used their judgment. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
