I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby when deliveries come. Initially, the signs were ignored, so she made a more prominent sign with courier logos, which worked but caused an issue when a food delivery was left at the door and got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mom's intention was to prevent the delivery person from knocking, which would wake her baby. She tried multiple times to communicate this through different signs and checkout notes. The new sign was effective in stopping the knocking but had a negative consequence for the food delivery. The food delivery person didn't knock and just left it, leading to it being cold.\n\nNow, am I the asshole here? The main question is whether her actions were reasonable. On one hand, she's a new mom dealing with a baby, so avoiding disturbances is important. On the other hand, food deliveries require timely handling, and not knocking might lead to the food being left outside where it can get cold. \n\nThe sign's purpose was to avoid knocking, but maybe she should have considered that food deliveries might need a different approach. Perhaps she should have specified exceptions for food or used a different method to manage both needs. However, the fact that she communicated her request clearly and the delivery person followed the instructions literally might mean the problem lies in the ambiguity of the sign. \n\nThe mom's husband thinks they were asking for it, implying that their own request led to the problem. But the mom argues that common sense should have prevailed. The delivery person might not have realized that the \"do not knock\" rule doesn't apply to food. So, is it the mom's fault for not making that exception clear, or the delivery person's fault for not using judgment?\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was unreasonable. The mom's intention was reasonable, but maybe the method had a flaw. She didn't specify exceptions, so the delivery person followed the sign strictly. However, expecting the delivery person to use common sense to differentiate between packages and food might be part of the job. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sign was unclear about exceptions, maybe she shares some responsibility. But considering she was a new mom and the primary issue was the knocking, her actions were to protect her baby. The fact that the sign worked for packages but not for food might mean the delivery person didn't consider the food's perishability. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because her intention was reasonable, but there's a nuanced part where the sign could have been clearer. However, the main issue was the delivery person not using judgment, so she might not be entirely at fault.\n"
