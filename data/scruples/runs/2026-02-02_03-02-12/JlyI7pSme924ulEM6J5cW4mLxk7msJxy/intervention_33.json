I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on her door. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with lots of packages. She had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but they were ignored. She then found a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the deliverer left it at the door without knocking, resulting in a cold meal. Her husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nSo, the key points here are the intent behind the signs. The original signs were for packages, which typically don't require immediate attention. Food delivery, on the other hand, is time-sensitive and requires someone to be present to receive it. The author didn't specify that the sign only applied to packages, but the sign included courier logos, which might imply all deliveries. However, food delivery is different from packages. The deliverer might not have realized the sign was only for packages. \n\nThe author had communicated \"Do not knock\" for packages, but food delivery is a different service. Maybe the deliverer assumed the rule applied to all deliveries. The author's mistake could be not clearly differentiating between package and food delivery instructions. However, the husband's comment about \"asking for it\" might be harsh, as the author's primary concern was not having packages left at the door, not food. \n\nIn terms of common sense, a food deliverer might expect that a cold meal would be a problem if left outside, so knocking would be necessary. But if the sign is there, they might follow it without questioning. The author might need to adjust her signs to clarify that they're for packages only. However, the deliverer not using judgment in this case could also be an issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She didn't specify that the \"Do not Knock\" was only for packages. Maybe she should have made that clearer. But the deliverer could have used common sense here, given that food delivery is different. The situation is a bit of a gray area. But since the author didn't explicitly state that the rule was only for packages, maybe she shares some responsibility. However, the deliverer might still be expected to use judgment. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author's intention was for packages, and food delivery is a different scenario. The deliverer should have recognized the difference and knocked. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting that, even if the sign wasn't clear. Common sense should have prevailed here.\n"
