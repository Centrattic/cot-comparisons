I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting packages and wants to avoid being knocked on the door. She put up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but the delivery people kept knocking until she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked. Then, when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold. The author is frustrated because the food was late and cold. Her husband says they're asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are: she put up clear signs, the delivery people ignored them until the visual sign worked. The sign might have been confusing because it had logos of couriers, which could imply it's only for package deliveries, not food. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but the result was a cold meal. \n\nThe author's intention was to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable, especially as a new mom. However, maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. If the sign said \"Do not knock for packages,\" then a food delivery isn't a package. The delivery person might have followed the literal instruction, not realizing the exception. The author expected them to use common sense, but the sign didn't make that clear. \n\nThe husband's point is that by putting up the sign, they were asking for the consequence. The author might be in the wrong because the sign was too broad. She didn't consider that different types of deliveries might require different handling. The delivery person followed the sign's directive but didn't think beyond it. So, maybe the author should have been more specific in her instructions. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person could have used better judgment. Even if the sign said \"Do not knock,\" it's reasonable to assume that a food delivery, which might be time-sensitive, would require some form of communication. But the sign didn't mention exceptions. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be partially at fault for not making the sign specific enough. She wanted to prevent being knocked for packages, but the sign didn't account for other types of deliveries. The delivery person followed the instruction but didn't consider the context, which is on the author for not clarifying. So, the answer might be A, she's in the wrong.\n"
