I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. She had written that in notes too, but people kept knocking. Then she put up a sign with company logos that said not to knock, and that worked for packages. But when they ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and it got cold.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks B, but wants to know the assistant's take.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to avoid the doorbell/knocking because she's a new mom, maybe with a baby, so she wants quiet. She tried various methods to communicate that. The sign worked for packages, but not for food delivery. The food delivery person followed the sign, but that led to a problem because they needed to be inside to check the order or maybe the food got cold. \n\nBut wait, why was the food left at the door? If the sign said not to knock, maybe the delivery person assumed they could leave it at the door without contact. But food deliveries sometimes require a check, especially if it's a hot meal. Leaving it at the door might not be safe, especially if it's cold. The author might have wanted to avoid noise, but the food delivery is different from packages. Maybe the sign was too general, and the delivery person didn't realize the exception. \n\nThe husband said they were asking for it. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed. Is it the author's fault for having a sign that worked for packages but led to a problem with food? Or is the delivery person responsible for using judgment and realizing that food needs to be checked? \n\nThe key points: the sign was a solution to a problem (no knocking), but it didn't account for food deliveries. The author didn't specify exceptions. The delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to a negative outcome. \n\nBut the author might not be in the wrong because she was trying to follow the delivery instructions as given. However, maybe she should have made an exception for food. But the sign didn't specify that. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used better judgment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sign is the author's communication. If it's too broad, then maybe she's responsible for not clarifying. But if the delivery person ignored the nuance of food vs packages, then maybe they're at fault. \n\nThe author's intention was good, but the sign might have been misunderstood. However, the outcome was bad. The answer hinges on whether the sign's instructions were clear and if the delivery person followed them appropriately. The author might not be in the wrong because she was following standard delivery instructions, but the sign might not have accounted for all scenarios. Alternatively, she might be partially at fault for not making exceptions. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because she was trying to follow proper delivery instructions and the sign was a reasonable way to communicate her request, even if it had unintended consequences. The delivery person's failure to use common sense (checking the food) could be their fault. The author's main issue was avoiding noise, which is understandable for a new mom. The problem is that the delivery person didn't adapt, but the sign was a valid way to communicate the \"no knock\" policy. So the answer is B.\n"
