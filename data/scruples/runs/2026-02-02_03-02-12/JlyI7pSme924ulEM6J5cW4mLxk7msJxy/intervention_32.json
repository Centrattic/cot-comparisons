I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who wants to avoid people knocking on her door, probably because she's trying to keep things quiet for her baby. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which didn't work. Then she found a sign with courier logos that worked, but now when they delivered food, they left it at the door and it got cold.\n\nSo the question is: is she the asshole for expecting the food deliverer to knock, even though she had the sign up? The sign was meant for packages, but maybe the food delivery person thought it applied to all deliveries. The author argues that the delivery person should have used common sense and knocked for food, which is time-sensitive. Her husband said they were asking for it, implying that the sign might have caused the issue.\n\nHmm. The sign was specific to packages, but maybe it wasn't clear. The author tried multiple times to specify \"do not knock\" in delivery notes, but that didn't work. Then the picture sign worked for packages, but maybe food is different. The delivery person followed the sign literally but didn't consider that food needs to be handed over. So, the author might not be in the wrong because the sign's intent was for packages, and food delivery is a different scenario. The delivery person should have knocked even if there's a sign against it for packages. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
