I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she, a new mom, had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages because she didn't want delivery people to knock when dropping off packages. She had both handwritten signs and notes in the delivery options, but they were ignored. So she found a new sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but then messed up when a food delivery person left the food at the door instead of knocking, leading to it being cold and late. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The main issue is whether her signs were reasonable and if the outcome makes her the asshole. She wanted no knocking for packages, but the food delivery person followed the sign and didn't knock, resulting in the food being left outside and getting cold. \n\nShe had multiple attempts to communicate her preference, and the visual sign with logos was effective. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages are just dropped off, but food usually requires someone to be there to receive it, hence the need to knock. The sign might have been misinterpreted by the delivery person as applying to all deliveries, not just packages. She might not have clarified that the sign was only for packages, not food. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she had a valid reason (being a new mom, maybe not wanting to be disturbed, or safety concerns). However, she didn't specify that the sign was only for packages. The delivery person followed the instructions literally, which led to an unintended consequence. The user argues that common sense should have prevailed, but maybe expecting the delivery person to differentiate between packages and food isn't reasonable. The husband's point is that they asked for it by not clarifying the sign. \n\nSo, considering that she didn't make it clear the sign was for packages only, and the delivery person followed it as written, perhaps she shares some responsibility. On the other hand, she was trying to solve a problem with previous deliveries ignoring her requests. The sign worked for packages but not for food. \n\nIn AITA cases, people often get called out if their solution caused harm without considering all scenarios. Here, the food delivery was a different context, and her sign didn't account for that. So, maybe she's in the wrong for not specifying, leading to the food being left. But then again, she had a valid need and tried multiple times to get the message across for packages. \n\nI think the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because her intention was to prevent knocking for packages, and the food delivery person might have overstepped by following the sign without checking if it applied to food. However, if the sign was ambiguous, she could have been more explicit. But given the context, the main issue is the delivery person's assumption rather than her sign. So, she's not in the wrong because she was trying to communicate her needs and the delivery person misinterpreted it. The problem is on the delivery side for not using common sense, as she argues.\n"
