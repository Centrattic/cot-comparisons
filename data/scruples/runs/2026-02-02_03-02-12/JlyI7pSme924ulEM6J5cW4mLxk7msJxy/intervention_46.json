I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had previously put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which were ignored. So she created a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door even though it was cold. The author is upset because the food was left outside and got cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is that the delivery person didn't knock, even though the food delivery situation is different from a regular package. The sign was effective for packages, but maybe the food delivery person misread the intent. The author expected the delivery person to knock for food, but the sign said not to knock, so they followed the instruction literally. The food was left outside and was ice cold, which is a problem. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting the person to knock in this case.\n\nThe author had put the \"Do not knock\" notes in multiple places, including during checkout. The sign was meant to prevent knocking for packages, which worked. However, food delivery usually requires someone to answer the door to receive hot food. The delivery person might have followed the sign strictly without considering the context. The author's husband's reaction suggests he thinks they invited this issue by having the sign up. The author argues that common sense should have been applied, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food delivery needs a different approach than a package.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author's intention was to prevent loud knocks from delivery people, which is understandable, especially for a new mom who might be dealing with a baby. However, she didn't differentiate between package deliveries and food deliveries in her instructions. The sign was a general instruction for all couriers, which might not have been clear enough. The delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to the problem. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From one perspective, she didn't specify that the \"Do not knock\" rule applies only to packages and not to food. So, the sign was ambiguous. The delivery person might have assumed the rule applied to all deliveries. On the other hand, the author expected that someone would use common sense to realize that leaving food at the door is inappropriate. \n\nIn such situations, it's a balance between following instructions and using judgment. The author's mistake might be not tailoring the instructions to different types of deliveries. However, the delivery person's mistake was not considering the context and just following the sign. The author's husband's comment implies that the sign led to the problem, so the author shares some responsibility. But does that make her the asshole?\n\nIn the typical \"Am I the Asshole\" context, the person is often in the wrong if they have a clear expectation that others should follow, but in this case, the instructions were ambiguous. The author might not be in the wrong because her intention was to prevent knocking, but she didn't foresee the need for differentiation. However, the delivery person also didn't use common sense, which the author is now blaming. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because the delivery person should have used judgment to knock for food. But the sign's ambiguity might be a factor. However, since the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, maybe the answer is B.\n"
