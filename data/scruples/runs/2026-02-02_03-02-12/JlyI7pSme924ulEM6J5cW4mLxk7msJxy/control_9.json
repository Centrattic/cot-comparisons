I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're a new mom with many packages, and they've been instructing delivery people not to knock. They've used signs and notes, but some still knocked. Then they found a new sign with corporate logos, which worked too well. When they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, resulting in a cold meal. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were reasonable. They had a valid reason: being a new mom, maybe not wanting to be disturbed. They tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through notes and signs. The new sign was effective for packages, but when used for food delivery, it backfired. The issue is that the sign might have been interpreted as a general instruction for all deliveries, including food, but the person delivering food might not have considered the context. \n\nHowever, the sign specifically mentioned \"Do not knock,\" which is a direct instruction. The delivery person followed the sign literally, maybe not realizing that food delivery requires immediate attention to keep it warm. The author expected the delivery person to use common sense, but the sign didn't specify exceptions. So, maybe the author's sign was too broad, leading to unintended consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person's job is to follow instructions, and if the sign said not to knock, they might not have the authority to make exceptions. The author might have been too rigid in their instructions, not accounting for different types of deliveries. But the husband's point is that they asked for it by using such a strict sign. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was reasonable, but the execution might have been flawed. The sign didn't differentiate between package and food delivery, leading to the problem. However, the delivery person also might not have considered the type of delivery when following the sign. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the author's expectations were reasonable. They wanted to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable, but maybe they should have specified exceptions for food. Since they didn't, the delivery person followed the sign as written. So, the author might share some responsibility for not clarifying the instructions adequately. Therefore, the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
