I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages because she didn't want delivery people to knock. She kept getting ignored, so she made a sign with courier logos that worked. Then, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and the food was cold.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether expecting the delivery person to knock for food delivery is unreasonable. The author had previously specified \"Do not knock\" for packages, which she needed for some reason, maybe because she was a new mom and needed to be quiet or couldn't answer the door. But when it comes to food delivery, maybe knocking would have been necessary because she was home and needed to receive it. However, the sign was for all deliveries, including food. \n\nThe author did mention that she wrote \"Do not knock\" in the delivery notes each time. But when she ordered dinner, she might have expected the delivery person to knock, even though she had the same sign up. The problem is that the sign worked too well, and the delivery person followed it strictly even for food. So maybe the sign didn't differentiate between packages and food deliveries. The author might not have considered that food delivery requires a different handling. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person followed the instructions as given. The sign was there, and they saw it, so they left it at the door. The author's husband thinks they asked for it, which implies maybe the sign was too broad. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food needs to be handed over. But the delivery person might not have the discretion to ignore the instructions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She set the instructions, but maybe she didn't specify that food deliveries should be knocked. She might be at fault for not making an exception for food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. But since the sign was clear, maybe the author is in the wrong for not adjusting her instructions when ordering food. \n\nBut considering she's a new mom, maybe she had a valid reason for the \"Do not knock\" instructions for packages, like she couldn't answer the door. However, when ordering food, she probably needs to be home to receive it. So maybe she didn't communicate that she wanted different handling for food. Therefore, she might be partly at fault for not clarifying. But the delivery person followed the sign, which was there for all deliveries. So both sides have some responsibility. But the question is whether she is the asshole. The answer might be B (No), because she had a valid reason for the sign, and the delivery person should have used common sense to knock for food, even if the sign was there. Or maybe A (Yes), because she didn't adjust the sign for food. \n\nI think the key is that the sign was meant for packages, not food. She should have had separate instructions for food deliveries. Since she didn't, the delivery person followed the sign, leading to the problem. So she's partly at fault for not clarifying. However, maybe the delivery person should have knocked regardless. But the sign said \"Do not knock,\" so the delivery person followed instructions. So the author is in the wrong because her instructions were too broad. So answer A.\n"
