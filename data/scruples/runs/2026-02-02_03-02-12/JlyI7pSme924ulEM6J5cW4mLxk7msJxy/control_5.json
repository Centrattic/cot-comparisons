I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has been trying to prevent delivery people from knocking because she's dealing with a baby. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" multiple times, but people kept knocking. Then she made a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when used for food delivery, the person left the food at the door, which got cold.\n\nSo, the main points here: She had clear instructions not to knock, which were ignored. Then she used a different sign that worked for packages but caused an issue with food. The food was left outside, leading to it being cold. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, her intention was to prevent knocking, which is understandable, especially as a new mom needing quiet. She tried multiple ways to communicate this. The problem came when the same sign was used for food delivery. The delivery person saw the sign and followed it by leaving the food at the door without knocking. However, food delivery usually requires someone to answer the door, so not knocking might be inappropriate here. The sign might have been intended for packages, not food. \n\nThe user wrote that common sense should have prevailed. The delivery person might not have realized the difference between a package and food delivery. The sign had courier logos, which might not differentiate between the two services. So, maybe the sign was ambiguous. The author's expectation was that the delivery person would use judgment, but the person followed the sign literally. \n\nHowever, the author set up the sign expecting it to apply to all deliveries, not considering that food delivery needs a different approach. So, maybe she's partly at fault for not clarifying that the sign was only for packages. On the other hand, the delivery person could have used common sense to realize that leaving food outside isn't appropriate. \n\nThe husband said they were asking for it, implying they should have known the sign might lead to this. The author thinks common sense should have been used, but maybe she didn't account for different types of deliveries. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She wanted to prevent knocking, but the method she used had unintended consequences. She might have been too rigid, not considering that food delivery needs a different handling. Alternatively, the delivery person should have knocked regardless of the sign because it's food. \n\nI think the answer is that she's not entirely at fault because her intention was reasonable, but maybe she didn't consider that different deliveries require different actions. The delivery person also failed to use judgment. But since the question is about her being in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether the sign was clear enough. If the sign didn't specify that it applies only to packages, then she might be partially at fault. However, since she was trying to solve the knocking problem, maybe she's not. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is probably B (No), because her intention was valid, and the delivery person should have used common sense. But there's a nuance here. The sign worked for packages, which are left outside, but food needs to be handed over. The author might not have considered this, but the delivery person should have known. So, the answer could be B.\n"
