I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" because she didn't want delivery people to knock when leaving packages. She got fed up when the instructions were ignored, so she put up a sign with courier logos, which worked but caused an issue when a food delivery person left the food at the door instead of knocking, leading to it getting cold.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's intention was to prevent deliveries from knocking, which she found disruptive, maybe because she's a new mom and needs quiet. She tried multiple times to communicate this, but people kept knocking. So she created a more effective sign. When it worked for packages, but then a food delivery person followed the same instruction, leading to a problem.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she clearly communicated her instructions. The food delivery person followed the sign, which was meant for packages. But food delivery might have different protocols. Maybe the sign was ambiguous because it included courier logos but didn't specify that it's only for packages. The food deliverer might have assumed the same rule applies. The author expected them to use common sense, but maybe the sign didn't clarify that. However, the husband says they asked for it, implying that the sign was too broad. The key here is whether the sign was clear enough. If the sign didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries, then the deliverer might have done what they thought was correct. On the other hand, the author's main issue was with knocking for packages, so maybe she should have specified that the sign only applies to non-food deliveries. But she didn't, so the deliverer followed the instruction literally. The question is whether expecting the deliverer to use common sense (like not leaving food outside) is reasonable. The deliverer might not know that the food is perishable and needs to be handed over. The author's instructions were clear but perhaps too broad. So she might be at fault for not specifying the exceptions. Alternatively, the deliverer didn't act wrong by following the sign. The answer might depend on how clear the instructions were. Since the sign included courier logos, maybe the deliverer thought it applied to all deliveries. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not making the instructions more specific. But maybe the deliverer should have known better. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author being at fault because the sign wasn't clear enough, leading to unintended consequences.\n"
