I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who had a lot of deliveries and kept getting knocked on the door, even though she had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" So she put up a sign with corporate logos to get attention, which worked for packages but then she ordered dinner, and the delivery person left it outside, resulting in cold food.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author tried multiple times to communicate that they don't want knocking, which is understandable, especially as a new mom who might need quiet for the baby. She used both handwritten signs and written notes during checkout. When those didn't work, she switched to a sign with logos, which the delivery person noticed and followed by not knocking. However, this time it was a food delivery, and the courier left it outside, which was inappropriate because food needs to be kept warm.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the sign was effective in preventing knocking for packages, but it didn't specify that it was only for non-food deliveries. The delivery person might not have realized that the sign applied to food orders as well. The sign with logos was meant to direct couriers to leave packages without knocking, which they did. But food delivery requires a different handling; the food should be handed over and not left outside. The author might have been too generic with the sign, not considering that different types of deliveries need different actions. However, she might argue that the sign was meant for all deliveries and that the delivery person should have used common sense to realize that leaving food outside isn't acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the sign's effectiveness was such that it was followed, which caused the problem. The delivery person didn't knock, following the sign, but left the food outside, which was probably against the usual delivery protocol for food. The author's intention was to stop knocking, but she didn't account for the proper handling of food deliveries. The husband's comment is that they were asking for it, implying that the sign was the reason the delivery wasn't properly handled. But the author's point is that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have known that food isn't left outside.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? The sign was clear about not knocking, but maybe didn't address the specific handling of food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't realize that the food needed to be handed over. The author might have been careless in not specifying the sign's scope. But the delivery person could have also checked the context. It's a bit of a gray area. The sign worked for packages, which are typically left outside, but food is usually given to a person. The author's mistake might be not making the sign specific enough for different delivery types. However, the delivery person also didn't use proper judgment in this case. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the sign's creator is responsible for ensuring the message is clear, but the delivery person is also responsible for following standard procedures for their type of delivery. Since the sign was ambiguous (not specifying which deliveries it applied to), and the delivery person didn't adapt, both might share some blame. But the main question is about the author's responsibility. If the sign was misinterpreted or too broad, she's partly at fault. However, if the delivery person should have known better, then the author isn't. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author was trying to communicate a specific instruction, and the delivery person failed to apply the appropriate handling for food. The sign was meant to prevent knocking, not to dictate where the food is left. The key here is that the sign was effective in stopping the knocking, which was the main issue, but the delivery person didn't handle the food properly. The author's intention was valid, but the execution of the sign might need to be more precise. However, the delivery person's actions were the direct cause of the problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the sign could have been clearer.\n"
