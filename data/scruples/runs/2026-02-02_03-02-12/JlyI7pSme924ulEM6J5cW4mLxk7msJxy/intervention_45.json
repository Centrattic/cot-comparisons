I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being a new mom who gets many deliveries. She's had issues with delivery people knocking on the door despite explicit instructions to not knock. She placed signs and wrote notes, but they were ignored. So she created a more visible sign with courier logos that worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking and left packages at the door. However, this time, a food delivery (which is time-sensitive) was left at the door and got cold. The author is upset, her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should apply.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent the door from being knocked, which she had tried multiple times. The signs were in place, and they worked for regular packages. The problem came with a food delivery, which requires a different handling. The delivery person left the food at the door, leading to it getting cold. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, she was trying to follow the instructions she set, but the delivery person didn't differentiate between a regular package and a food delivery that needs to be handed over. The husband's comment suggests he thinks they should have known the consequence of the sign. However, the author argues that common sense would have led the delivery person to realize that a food delivery shouldn't be left outside.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's attempts to communicate her preference, the effectiveness of the sign, and the specific issue with food delivery. The author's main issue is that the delivery person didn't use judgment to handle the food delivery appropriately, even though the sign was there. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author was following through on her request, but the delivery person failed to adapt. The sign was meant to prevent knocking, but the situation required a different action for food. So, the delivery person didn't follow the instructions properly for that specific case. The author might be in a position where she needs to adjust her sign to clarify that food should be handled differently, but in this specific instance, the delivery person didn't use common sense. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she communicated her request, and the delivery person failed to adjust for the unique needs of a food delivery. So the answer would be B.\n"
