I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been receiving packages and food deliveries. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" because previous deliveries were left at the door when no one was home. She tried various methods to communicate this, including notes on packages and delivery options, but they were ignored. Eventually, she put up a sign with corporate logos that effectively stopped the knocking, but when they ordered food, the delivery person just left it at the door even though it was cold and late.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main issue is with deliveries being left at the door when she's not home, leading to cold food. She took measures to communicate her preference, which worked for packages but not for food. The key point here is whether the sign was appropriate in this situation.\n\nThe sign in question has corporate logos, which might imply that she wants deliveries left at the door regardless of the company. However, food delivery usually expects a different protocol compared to packages. Food needs to be delivered promptly to stay hot, so the delivery person might not have left it there intentionally but had no other choice due to the sign.\n\nThe author's husband says they asked for it, suggesting that by putting the sign up, they're responsible for the food being left at the door. On the other hand, the author argues that common sense should have prevailed\u2014even if the sign was there, the delivery person should have called or tried again later to ensure the food wasn't left cold.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author communicated her instructions clearly, but maybe didn't consider that food delivery requires more immediate handling. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction but didn't account for the perishable nature of food. However, the sign's effectiveness for packages shows it works, but maybe the same approach isn't suitable for food.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She tried to communicate her preferences, but perhaps didn't anticipate that the sign would affect food deliveries differently. The delivery person might have followed the sign without understanding the context of food needing to be delivered hot. The author's intention was to prevent theft and ensure packages are left safely, but food delivery requires a different approach. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because she followed the delivery instructions, but she should have anticipated that food delivery needs a different handling method. However, the delivery person also should have used common sense to ensure the food wasn't left cold. So, maybe both parties have some responsibility. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is probably B (No) because she communicated her instructions and the delivery person didn't adapt appropriately.\n"
