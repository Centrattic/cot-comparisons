I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery drivers knocking on her door despite clear instructions not to. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and also included notes in every checkout. But the drivers kept knocking. Then she used a sign with the company logos, which worked\u2014packages were left without knocking. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food on the doorstep, and it got cold. Now she's wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made repeated efforts to communicate that she didn't want to be disturbed, which is understandable, especially as a new mom. The drivers ignored her instructions, so she took a stronger approach by using a sign with company logos. It worked for packages, which is good. But when it came to a food delivery that needed to be handed off, the driver followed the same protocol, leading to a cold meal.\n\nIs the author at fault? She wanted to avoid interruptions, which is reasonable. However, food deliveries typically require the driver to deliver the item in person, not just leave it. The sign might have been interpreted as a universal \"do not knock\" for all deliveries, but maybe the drivers should have used their judgment for food. The user's husband thinks they \"asked for it,\" implying that their own sign led to the problem. \n\nThe key here is whether the sign was too broad. The author intended it to prevent knocking for packages but didn't consider that food might need a different approach. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, so maybe the author should have specified \"do not knock\" only for packages. However, the main issue is that the drivers previously ignored the \"do not knock\" instructions, leading her to create a more effective sign. In this case, the food delivery person's strict adherence to the sign caused the problem. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely at fault. She was trying to manage her environment as a new mom. The drivers didn't follow the initial instructions, so she had to escalate. The food delivery's outcome was unintended, but the main issue was the drivers' initial non-compliance. The answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
