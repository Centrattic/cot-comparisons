I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's been having issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear handwritten signs saying \"Do not Knock\" and also specifying it in delivery notes. The problem is she kept getting knocked on even after those instructions. So she decided to use a more explicit sign with pictures of the couriers to make sure they see it. That worked for packages, but now when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking and it got cold.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a new mom, which often means she's stressed or dealing with a lot. The initial issue was that her previous instructions to not knock were ignored. Maybe the new sign was too effective, leading to the food being left outside where it shouldn't be. \n\nBut wait, the sign was meant for packages, not food deliveries. The user might not have made that distinction clear on the sign. The delivery person saw the sign with courier logos and assumed it applied to all deliveries. So maybe she's responsible for not specifying that the sign is only for packages. However, the original problem was that she was being disturbed by deliveries, and she tried to find a solution that worked. \n\nThe delivery person should use common sense too. Leaving a food order outside in the cold isn't safe, especially in bad weather. But the user's sign might have been ambiguous. She probably didn't expect the sign to affect food deliveries, but the visual cues (courier logos) could be interpreted as applying to all deliveries. \n\nHer husband says they were asking for it. That suggests he thinks leaving the food outside was their fault. But the user's intention was to avoid being disturbed, which is understandable. The delivery person should have either knocked or checked if the sign was meant for packages only. \n\nSo, she might be at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope, but the delivery person also failed to use common sense. The main issue is that the sign was effective for packages but not for food. The user's actions led to the food being left outside, which caused a problem. However, the user's intent was to prevent being bothered, which is a valid reason. \n\nIn the end, maybe she's not in the wrong because the sign was a solution to a problem she had, but the lack of clarity might mean she shares some responsibility. But the key is that the delivery person should have ensured the food was delivered safely, regardless of the sign. So the primary blame could be on the delivery person, but the user's sign might have contributed. However, since the user's intent was to avoid disturbances, and the sign's effectiveness was the issue, maybe she's not the asshole. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the user's intention was to avoid being disturbed, and the delivery person should have used better judgment. The sign was a response to prior problems, and the main issue is the delivery person's failure to follow safe practices despite the sign.\n"
