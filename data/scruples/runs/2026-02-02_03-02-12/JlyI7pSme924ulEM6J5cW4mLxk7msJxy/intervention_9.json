I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a new mom, keeps getting packages delivered with people knocking on the door despite her clear instructions not to. She put up signs and notes, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with courier logos that worked, but now a food delivery person left the ice cold meal at the door, causing a problem. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main goal was to prevent delivery people from knocking, which was causing her stress, possibly because she's a new mom and needs to take care of the baby. She tried multiple ways to communicate \"do not knock,\" but it didn't work. The new sign with logos was effective for packages but caused an issue with food delivery because the person didn't knock and left the food outside, which got cold.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's at fault. The user thinks she's not in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, she's trying to protect her home environment and communicated her preferences clearly. The sign worked for the intended purpose (package deliveries), but it had an unintended consequence for food deliveries. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction to not knock, but in doing so, didn't ensure the food was delivered properly. The food delivery usually requires more immediate attention to keep it warm, so not knocking led to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the sign was specific to packages, but maybe it's too broad. The food delivery person might have thought the sign applied to all deliveries, not just packages. The author might have been too generalized with the sign, not differentiating between types of deliveries. However, she was clear in her instructions previously, and the sign was a visual that worked. It's possible the delivery person didn't realize the difference between a food delivery and a package delivery.\n\nThe husband says they were asking for it, but the author argues common sense should apply. The delivery person should have recognized the food delivery needs versus a regular package. But maybe the sign didn't specify. The key here is whether the author's sign was ambiguous. If the sign had the courier logos for packages, perhaps the food delivery service isn't covered by it. However, the sign's wording might not have been specific enough, leading the delivery person to follow it for all deliveries, including food.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person should have used judgment. Even if the sign says not to knock, food is time-sensitive. Common sense would suggest that leaving a hot meal at the door without ensuring it's picked up promptly is not acceptable. The delivery person should have knocked to confirm receipt, especially when the food is time-sensitive. The author's instructions were to not knock, but that's for when she's not available (for packages). Food deliveries require immediate attention, so the delivery person should have made an exception.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her preference clearly, and the delivery person should have used common sense. The sign might need to be more specific, but the main issue is the delivery person not adapting to the situation. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
