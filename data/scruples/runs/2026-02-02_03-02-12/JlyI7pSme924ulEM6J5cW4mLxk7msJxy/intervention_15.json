I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions. She put up signs saying not to knock, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with logos from the couriers, and it worked. However, the food was left at the door and got cold. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the main points: She's a new mom, which might mean she's dealing with the stress and fatigue that comes with that. She's had consistent problems with deliveries. She tried multiple ways to communicate \"no knocking,\" but it didn't work. So she switched to a more visual sign with company logos, which was effective. The consequence was that the food delivery person didn't knock and left the food outside, leading to it being cold. Her husband thinks they were asking for it, but she believes common sense should've been used.\n\nNow, considering the options. The question is whether she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she was trying to prevent the noise (maybe a baby sleeping or needing quiet), so she used the sign. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was not to knock, but instead of leaving it at the door, maybe they should have considered that the food might need to be delivered properly. But the sign didn't specify to leave it at the door; it just said not to knock. So the delivery person might have assumed that if there's no knocking, they can leave it. However, the food's temperature was an issue because it was left outside.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might have thought that since the sign said not to knock, they had to leave it at the door regardless. The user's sign was effective in stopping the knocking, which was the main goal, but the unintended consequence was the cold food. The user might not be in the wrong because she was trying to protect her home environment. However, maybe the sign should have included instructions on where to leave the package, not just \"no knock.\" But she didn't expect the delivery to be left in a way that affected the food's temperature.\n\nHer husband's opinion is that they were asking for it, which suggests he might see their actions as leading to the problem. The user's stance is that common sense should prevail, meaning the delivery person should have known that leaving food outside might not be appropriate. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit tricky. She tried to communicate her needs clearly, but the sign might have been too blunt without considering the delivery person's need to complete the delivery properly. However, her intention was to prevent knocking, and the delivery person did follow the instruction. The problem arose from not considering the method of delivery beyond just not knocking. The user might be in the right because the sign's purpose was met, but maybe she could have added more detail to her instructions. Still, the main issue was the knocking, which she successfully addressed. The cold food is an unfortunate side effect, but not necessarily her fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
