I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their food deliverer to knock on their door. The situation involves the author, a new mom, who has been dealing with numerous deliveries. She had put up signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, which were ignored. Then she used a sign with corporate logos that worked for packages but caused an issue with a food delivery that was left at the door and went cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author wanted to prevent delivery people from knocking because she's a new mom, possibly needing rest or avoiding disturbances. She tried multiple methods to communicate her preference, but they weren't respected. Then she used a sign that worked for packages but didn't account for food deliveries needing to be kept warm. The delivery person followed the sign's instructions, leaving the food at the door, which resulted in it being cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been applied.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author have a reasonable expectation? The sign was intended for packages, not food. The author might not have realized the distinction. The delivery person, following the sign, did what was asked but didn't consider the perishable nature of food. The author's intention was to stop knocking, but the result was a cold meal. \n\nThe author's actions were to protect her own needs (as a new mom), but the unintended consequence was a problem with food delivery. The question is whether she's at fault. Since the sign was specific to packages and didn't mention food, maybe the delivery person should have used judgment. However, the author didn't specify that food should still be knocked for. It's a mix of communication gaps and expectations. \n\nIn the AITA format, often the community looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author tried multiple times to communicate her preference, but the solution she found worked too well, including for food. She might not have considered that food deliveries require different handling. The delivery person followed the instructions given but didn't apply common sense. However, the author's intention was valid, but the outcome was a mistake due to not anticipating the food delivery scenario. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the sign was clearly for non-perishables or if the author should have specified. Since the sign had corporate logos, maybe it was seen as a general instruction. The author's mistake was not differentiating between package and food deliveries. Therefore, she might share some responsibility. However, the delivery person should have used better judgment. In AITA contexts, sometimes the person's intentions matter. The author's intention was to avoid disturbances, which is understandable. The outcome was a consequence of the sign being followed literally. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance. The author's actions weren't malicious, but they led to an unintended problem. However, the delivery person also had a responsibility to use common sense. So, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The main issue is the sign's ambiguity. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
