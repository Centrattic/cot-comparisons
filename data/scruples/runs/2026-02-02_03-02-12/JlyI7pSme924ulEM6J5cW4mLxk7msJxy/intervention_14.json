I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting packages delivered and kept putting signs saying \"Do not knock,\" which were ignored. So she made a new sign with courier logos that worked for packages but not for food. The food delivery person left the ice cold meal at the door without knocking, leading to the question if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the deliverers kept knocking despite her clear instructions not to. She tried multiple times to communicate this through signs and delivery notes. Then, when using the sign with the logos, it worked for packages but not for food delivery. The food delivery person left the meal at the door, which was cold when they noticed.\n\nThe key points here are the communication of her preferences and whether the delivery person failed to use common sense. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed. The husband says they were asking for it, implying that maybe the sign was too effective or the delivery person misinterpreted it.\n\nBut wait, the sign was specific to packages, maybe? The sign has corporate logos, which might be for different services. The food delivery person might have seen the sign but assumed it only applied to packages, not meals. So the deliverer might have thought that since it's a different service, the instruction doesn't apply. However, the author made the same \"Do not knock\" instruction in all delivery notes, including for food. But the deliverer didn't follow it. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock despite her previous instructions? She had a valid reason\u2014maybe knocking would disturb the baby. But the delivery person didn't knock, leading to the meal being cold. The delivery person might not have known about the baby or the need for quiet. The sign was in place to prevent knocking, but in this case, it caused an issue because the delivery person didn't knock when it was necessary for the food to be delivered warm.\n\nSo, there's a conflict between the author's preference to not have the door knocked on and the food delivery person's responsibility to ensure the meal is delivered properly. The author's instructions were clear, but the delivery person might have misinterpreted the sign's scope or didn't check if knocking was needed for the food. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whose responsibility it is. The author did communicate her preferences, but the delivery person might not have considered the specific needs of food delivery. However, the author's sign was broad, and maybe she should have specified exceptions for food. But the food delivery person should have used common sense to knock if necessary to ensure the meal's temperature. \n\nIn the end, the delivery person didn't follow the instruction correctly, but the author's main issue was the initial problem of people knocking despite her signs. The food delivery person's mistake caused the problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she had a reason to avoid noise, but the delivery person failed to adapt. However, the sign might have been too broad, not accounting for different delivery types. \n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because she tried to communicate her needs, but the delivery person didn't use judgment in this specific case. The problem is more on the delivery person's side, so the answer would be B (No).\n"
