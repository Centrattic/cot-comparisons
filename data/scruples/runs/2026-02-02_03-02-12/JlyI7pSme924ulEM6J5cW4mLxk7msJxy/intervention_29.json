I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbances, especially with packages. However, when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, resulting in a cold meal.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent knocking for packages. She took steps to inform the delivery people through various signs and notes. The sign she used later included specific courier logos, which worked for packages but apparently not for food. The food delivery person saw the sign and left it at the door, which was against their usual practice of knocking for food, leading to the meal being cold.\n\nThe key points here are the difference between package delivery and food delivery. Packages might typically be left at the door without a knock, especially if the customer requests it. Food delivery, on the other hand, usually requires a knock or a call to deliver hot meals, which need to be handed over promptly to maintain temperature and safety. The author might not have realized that the \"Do not Knock\" instruction might be misinterpreted for food orders. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they were asking for it, suggesting that the sign was too broad and applied to all deliveries. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock despite the sign. \n\nConsidering that the sign specifically mentioned courier logos, maybe the food delivery service wasn't covered under those logos. However, the sign might have been ambiguous. Alternatively, the food deliverer might have followed the sign's instruction literally, not considering that food delivery is different. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author tried to communicate their preferences, but perhaps didn't specify different instructions for different types of deliveries. However, the main issue is that the food delivery person might have acted in accordance with the sign without realizing the nuance between packages and food. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting a knock for food, as that's standard practice. The problem might be in the ambiguity of the sign not differentiating between package and food deliveries. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
