I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. The situation involves the author, a new mom, who has been dealing with packages left at the door despite multiple signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" They even used a sign with corporate logos, which worked for packages but not for food delivery. The food was left outside and got cold.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to specify delivery instructions. They tried multiple ways to communicate this, which shows they were proactive. The sign that worked for packages was effective until it came to food. The food delivery person didn't knock and left it outside, leading to the food being cold. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author clearly stated \"Do not Knock\" in various places, including delivery notes. However, when a food delivery person followed the same instructions meant for packages, it caused an issue. The conflict arises because the instructions were not specific to the type of delivery. The sign might not have been clear enough to differentiate between packages and food deliveries. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests he believes the author's instructions were too rigid. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed, implying the deliverer should have known food needs to be handed over in person. But the deliverer might have just followed the same instructions given for packages without considering the difference between a food delivery and a package.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's instructions were reasonable. They tried multiple times to communicate their preference, but perhaps the instructions were too broad. However, the deliverer's action followed the given instructions, even if it led to an unintended consequence. The author's intention was to prevent packages from being left at the door, but food delivery is a different scenario. It's a bit of a misunderstanding between the type of delivery and the instructions provided. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because they communicated their preferences clearly, but maybe they should have specified different instructions for food. However, the deliverer also had a professional responsibility to use judgment. The situation is a bit of a gray area. But since the author did their part to communicate, and the deliverer followed the instructions albeit without discretion, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
