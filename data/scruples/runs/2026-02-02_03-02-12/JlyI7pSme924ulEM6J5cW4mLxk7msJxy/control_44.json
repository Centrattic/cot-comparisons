I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the new mom) is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer not to knock. The situation is that she had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" for packages, which worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery. The food was left at the door and got cold because the delivery person didn't knock to let her in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's a new mom, which implies she might be dealing with a lot, maybe a baby who needs care. The signs were for packages, which she wanted left at the door to avoid noise or disturbance, especially if the baby is sleeping. However, food delivery is different because it's perishable and needs to be kept at a certain temperature. Leaving it outside could lead to it getting cold or even unsafe if left too long.\n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The signs were for packages, not food. Maybe the delivery person didn't realize the sign applied to food orders. \n2. The sign had corporate logos, so maybe the deliverer thought it was a general instruction for all deliveries, not just packages. \n3. The deliverer left the food at the door, which isn't ideal because food should be delivered hot and promptly. \n\nShe had previously tried various methods to stop knocking, which worked for packages but not for food. The husband says they asked for it, which suggests there's a conflict in the household. The author's point is that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food needs to be delivered properly, not just left outside. \n\nBut does she have a right to expect the delivery person to know the sign doesn't apply to food? The sign's wording is \"Do not knock,\" which might not specify that it's for packages only. The delivery person might interpret it as a general instruction for all deliveries. However, the delivery person should know that food requires a different handling. \n\nThe problem is the sign's ambiguity. If the sign was more specific, like \"Leave packages at the door, do not knock for food deliveries,\" then the issue might not have happened. But since the sign is general, the deliverer followed the instruction literally. \n\nIs the author at fault for not clarifying that the sign is only for packages? Possibly. She might have assumed the delivery person would use common sense, but the deliverer followed the written instruction without considering the context. However, the deliverer also has a responsibility to ensure the food is delivered appropriately. \n\nThe food being left at the door and getting cold is a problem, but is the author to blame? The deliverer should have checked if the recipient is available to take the food, especially since it's a food delivery. Maybe the sign's presence was a red herring. The deliverer might have been in a hurry, or maybe the sign was too clear, leading to the mistake. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a shared responsibility. The author's sign was too generic, leading to the misunderstanding. The delivery person should have used judgment to handle food properly. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSince the author's intention was to avoid noise from knocking (especially with a baby), she might not have considered the implications for food. But she could have made the sign more specific. The fact that the sign worked too well for packages but not for food suggests that the sign's message was too broad. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the sign's ambiguity is her fault. If she didn't clarify that the sign was only for packages, then she might be at least partially responsible. However, the delivery person should have ensured the food was delivered correctly. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because her intention was to avoid disturbance, but she might have been careless in how she communicated the instruction. The delivery person also has a duty to handle food properly. It's a bit of a gray area, but since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because the main fault is on the delivery person for not using common sense with food. But maybe the answer is A (Yes) because she didn't make the sign specific enough. \n\nWait, the user's husband said they were asking for it. The argument is that the sign led to the problem. If the sign was clear and the delivery person followed it, but the result was bad, the author might have not considered the consequences. However, the delivery person's job is to deliver food correctly, which includes ensuring it's hot. So maybe the delivery person is at fault. \n\nIn online forums, people often say that signs are for the delivery person's benefit, so if you don't want them to knock, you put a sign. But in this case, the sign was misapplied. The author's mistake was not specifying that the sign is for packages, not food. So maybe she is in the wrong (A) because she didn't make the instructions clear enough. Alternatively, the delivery person should have known better with food. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the sign's ambiguity led to the problem, maybe the answer is A. However, the delivery person's failure to handle the food properly is also a factor. But the question is about the author's responsibility. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the main issue is the delivery person's failure to use judgment. The author's sign was meant to prevent noise, but the delivery person should have checked if the recipient was available for food. However, if the sign was too clear, leading to the delivery person leaving it, the author might have some responsibility. \n\nThis is tricky. The sign was effective for packages, but food is different. The delivery person should have realized that leaving food outside would be bad. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the delivery person should have used common sense. Therefore, answer B.\n"
