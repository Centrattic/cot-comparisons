I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages, but the delivery people kept knocking, so she put up a sign with logos that worked. Then, when a food delivery was left at the door and got cold, she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. She's a new mom, so maybe she's stressed or has specific needs. She tried multiple times to communicate not to knock, but the delivery people ignored her instructions. The sign with logos was effective in stopping the knocking, which she wanted. But the consequence was that the food delivery was left outside and got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks she's not in the wrong and wants my opinion.\n\nFrom a communication standpoint, she tried to make her preferences clear through written notes, but the delivery people didn't follow them. Her sign was a visual cue that worked, but it might have been too absolute. The food delivery person saw the sign and left the food outside, which led to it being cold. The problem here is that the sign might have been interpreted as \"no contact at all,\" which isn't what she intended for food deliveries that require immediate pickup.\n\nIn this case, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she achieved. However, the method she used might not have been specific enough. If the sign didn't differentiate between package deliveries and food deliveries that need to be signed for or received in person, the delivery person might have misunderstood. The key here is whether the sign was ambiguous. If it was a general \"Do not knock\" sign without exceptions, the delivery person might have followed it literally, even for a food delivery that requires immediate attention.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person should have used some common sense. Even if the sign says \"Do not knock,\" if the food is hot and needs to be signed for, maybe the delivery person should have knocked to ensure the recipient could take it immediately. However, the sign might have been interpreted as a strict rule, so the delivery person followed it without questioning.\n\nThe author's responsibility is in how she communicated her preferences. Since she included corporate logos on the sign, maybe it was meant to apply to all deliveries from those companies. But the sign might not have been clear that it only applied to packages, not food deliveries. So, perhaps the author could have been more specific in her instructions. However, she did try multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock,\" and the sign was effective in preventing that. The unintended consequence was the food being left outside. \n\nIn AITA situations, people often expect others to read between the lines or use common sense. The author might not be in the wrong because she was trying to avoid knocking, which she had a reason for (as a new mom, maybe she doesn't want to be disturbed). The delivery person could have used better judgment, but the author's sign was clear on the surface. The issue is the lack of specificity on the sign. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention was good, but the method might have been flawed. However, the delivery person also has some responsibility to use common sense. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because she communicated her request, even if it led to an unintended consequence. The answer might be B (No).\n"
