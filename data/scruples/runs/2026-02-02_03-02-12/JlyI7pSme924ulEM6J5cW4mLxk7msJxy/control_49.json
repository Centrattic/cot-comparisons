I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a new mom with lots of packages. She wanted to prevent knockers from waking the baby, so she put up signs saying \"Do not knock.\" But people kept knocking anyway. Then she found a sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door instead of knocking. The food got cold, and the husband says they were asking for it. The author is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether expecting the delivery person to knock when the sign says not to is reasonable. The sign was meant to prevent disturbances, especially for a baby. The food delivery was part of the same sign? The sign includes the courier logos, so the delivery person followed it literally. But the problem here is that the food delivery is time-sensitive, unlike packages. The author didn't specify different instructions for food. Maybe she should have added a note for food orders, like \"knock for food.\" But she didn't, so the delivery person followed the general rule. The husband's point is that they asked for no knocking, hence the consequence. But the author argues that common sense should have been used. However, in this case, the delivery person might not consider the context and just follow the sign. So the author might be in the wrong because she didn't clarify that food deliveries should knock. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. It's a bit of a gray area. But the sign was effective in preventing knocks for packages, but not considering food. The author's mistake was not tailoring the instructions for different types of deliveries. So answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
