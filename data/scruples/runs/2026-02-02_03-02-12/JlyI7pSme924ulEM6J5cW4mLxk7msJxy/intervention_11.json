I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying not to knock, which was for package deliveries. But when they ordered food, the delivery person saw the sign and left it at the door, making it cold. The author is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had specific instructions for package deliveries, and the sign was meant for those. However, the food delivery wasn't a package. The sign might have been misinterpreted. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction to not knock, which led to the food being left at the door. \n\nThe key points here are intent and communication. The author's main issue was with package deliveries, not food. The sign's purpose was clear for packages, but food delivery is different. The delivery person might have thought the same sign applied to all deliveries, hence the action. \n\nThe author's frustration comes from the food being cold because they weren't there. But maybe the sign was too broad. The author did mention corporate logos, so maybe the sign was meant for their specific package deliveries. However, the food delivery person might not have realized that distinction. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they tried to communicate their needs clearly for packages, but the sign's placement or content might have caused confusion. The delivery person followed the instruction, which wasn't wrong. The problem arises from the sign's ambiguity. \n\nThe husband says they were asking for it, which adds tension. The author's husband's reaction suggests he feels they should have considered the consequences for other deliveries. But the author's intention was to prevent knocking, not to have all deliveries left at the door. \n\nIn terms of common sense, maybe the author should have realized that such a sign might apply to all deliveries, not just packages. But the delivery person's action was also based on the given instructions. It's a bit of a communication gap. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because their primary intent was for package deliveries. However, the sign's effectiveness for other types of deliveries wasn't considered. The delivery person followed the sign correctly, but the outcome wasn't intended. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), as the misunderstanding was due to the sign's application beyond its intended purpose. The fault isn't entirely the author's since the sign was followed as per its message, but maybe the author should adjust the sign's clarity in the future.\n"
