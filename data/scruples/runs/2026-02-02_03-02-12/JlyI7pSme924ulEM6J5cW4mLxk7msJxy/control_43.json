I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has multiple packages delivered. She tried various signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" which were ignored. Then she used a sign with the courier logos to stop people from knocking, and it worked for packages. But when they ordered food, the deliverer didn't knock, left it at the door, and it got cold. Now she's upset.\n\nFirst, the key point is the sign. The original purpose was to prevent people from knocking for packages, which she had successfully done. The sign included food delivery logos, so the deliverer saw it and didn't knock. But the food was supposed to be delivered, so not knocking led to a problem. \n\nThe question is whether the author's expectations were reasonable. She wanted no knocking for packages, but perhaps food requires a different handling. Maybe the sign was too broad. The deliverer followed the sign's instruction, but the result was a cold meal. The user is upset, but did she set up the situation for that outcome? \n\nHer husband said they were asking for it. Maybe he's right if the sign applied to all deliveries, including food. But the author argues that common sense should have prevailed. However, the deliverer may not have known that food is different. The sign didn't specify exceptions. So, maybe the author should have clarified that the \"Do not knock\" rule applies only to packages, not food. \n\nAlternatively, the deliverer should have knocked regardless of the sign because food is time-sensitive. But the sign might not have that nuance. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that different delivery types need different handling. She created a rule that's too strict without exceptions. \n\nOn the other hand, she had a valid reason to want no knocking for packages (as a new mom, maybe with a baby inside). But food delivery is different. The problem arose because the sign didn't distinguish. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she had a good reason, but the situation is ambiguous. Alternatively, A if the sign was too broad. \n\nI think the key is that the sign was intended to prevent knocking for packages, but food is a different scenario. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting the sign to work as intended, but perhaps the deliverer should have used judgment. However, the author didn't specify exceptions, so maybe she's at fault. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because the sign was specific to the couriers mentioned, and food delivery might be a separate service. But the sign included food logos, so the deliverer likely followed it. The author didn't consider that food needs to be handled differently. Maybe she's not in the wrong because the deliverer should have known better, but the husband's point is that they asked for it. This is tricky. I'll go with B, the author is not in the wrong because she had a valid reason and the deliverer should have exercised common sense despite the sign.\n"
