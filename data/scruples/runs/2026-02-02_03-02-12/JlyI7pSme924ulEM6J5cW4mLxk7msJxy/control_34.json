I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who wanted her packages delivered without knocking. She put up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but they were ignored. Then she got a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when she ordered food, the delivery person didn't knock, left it at the door, and it got cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about the signs and the expectations. She had specific instructions to not knock for packages, and the delivery person followed those by not knocking. But when it came to food, maybe the delivery person assumed the same rules applied. However, food delivery is different from packages. Packages can be left at the door safely, but food is time-sensitive and needs to be handed over to avoid getting cold. \n\nShe might be in the wrong if she didn't make a distinction between package deliveries and food deliveries. The sign might not have specified that it only applied to packages. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instructions without knowing there was an exception for food. On the other hand, the delivery person could have used their judgment to knock for food. The mom's intention was to avoid disturbance, but the delivery person's duty is to ensure the item is delivered properly, especially with perishables. \n\nSo, maybe the mom assumed the delivery person would exercise common sense, but the delivery person followed the instructions literally. However, the mom didn't account for different types of deliveries. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong because the delivery person didn't adjust for the food's needs. Alternatively, she might be in the wrong if she didn't clarify different delivery types. \n\nI think the delivery person should have known that food requires a different approach. But the sign didn't specify, so the delivery person followed the given instructions. The mom's husband's comment about asking for it suggests that her signs caused the problem. But she might not be in the wrong if the delivery person didn't prioritize the food's condition. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer could hinge on whether the delivery person's job includes using judgment beyond written instructions. I'm leaning towards the mom not being in the wrong because she had a legitimate reason to avoid noise, but the delivery person could have made an exception. However, maybe she should have separated the instructions for package vs. food. Since the sign didn't specify, the delivery person followed it, leading to the cold food. So maybe she's in the wrong for not making the distinction clear.\n"
