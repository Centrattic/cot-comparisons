I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, previously had issues with package deliveries where the delivery people kept knocking despite signs saying not to. So she put up a sign with corporate logos to make it clear, which worked for packages. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock, left the food at the door, and it got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a history of problems with people knocking when they didn't want to be disturbed. Maybe because she's a new mom, she's trying to manage things without being interrupted. She tried multiple times to communicate \"Do not knock\" through notes and signs. The sign she used for packages was effective, but maybe the dinner delivery person saw the same sign and followed it literally without considering that food delivery is different from packages. \n\nSo the conflict is between the author's need for privacy (not wanting people to knock) and the necessity for food delivery, which might require getting someone's attention quickly. The delivery person might not have realized that the sign applies only to packages, not food. The sign's design with corporate logos might be confusing. The author might be in the right because she's trying to follow the rules she set up, but the delivery person also has a job to do, which is to deliver hot food. However, the sign's ambiguity led to the problem. \n\nThe key points are whether the sign was clear enough to differentiate between packages and food, and if the delivery person should have used common sense. The author argues that common sense should prevail, but the delivery person followed the sign literally. The husband says they asked for it, implying that the sign caused the problem. \n\nIt seems like the author's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, which she did successfully. However, when it came to food, maybe the sign wasn't specific enough. The author might not be entirely at fault because the delivery person didn't check if there was a specific instruction for food orders. On the other hand, the sign didn't specify that it only applied to packages. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the sign's ambiguity is the author's fault. If the sign was unclear, maybe she should have made it more specific. But if the sign was clear, then the delivery person should have known to knock for food. Since the sign had corporate logos for couriers, maybe it's for packages, but food delivery might be a different service. The author might not be in the wrong because she was following her own instructions, but the delivery person should have used their judgment. However, the delivery person might have followed the sign correctly, so the author's sign was too broad. \n\nIn the end, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the problem stemmed from the sign's ambiguity, not her intent. The delivery person should have used common sense to realize that food delivery requires a different approach. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
