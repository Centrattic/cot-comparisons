I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had a lot of package deliveries. She's been asking both through written notes and delivery notes to not knock. The problem is that the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So she put up a sign with courier logos that said \"Do Not Knock,\" which worked for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The food arrived cold because the delivery person just left it at the door without knocking, even though it was a perishable item that needed to be picked up quickly.\n\nThe user is asking if she's the asshole (AITA) for expecting the delivery person to knock. She's wondering if she was wrong to ask for that. Her husband thinks they were asking for it, but she believes common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Answer A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, consider her intentions. She's a new mom, which adds context to her stress and need for quiet. She's been consistent in her requests, both through signs and delivery notes. The sign worked for packages, which is good, but food delivery is different because timing and temperature matter. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was not to knock, leading to the cold food issue.\n\nIs she at fault for not anticipating that the sign might affect food deliveries differently? Or is the delivery person at fault for not using discretion? The sign's effectiveness for packages shows it worked as intended, but food deliveries require a different handling. Maybe she should have specified that the sign applies only to packages. Alternatively, the delivery person should have made a judgment call based on the situation, like knocking for food to ensure it's received promptly.\n\nThe key points are her repeated requests, the sign's success with packages, and the unintended consequence with food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but it led to a problem. However, the user might be responsible for not clarifying the sign's scope. The husband's comment suggests he thinks they invited the issue by having the sign. But the user's perspective is that the delivery person should have used common sense.\n\nIn the AITA context, often the person who creates a situation that leads to unintended consequences might be held responsible. However, the user's intent was valid\u2014to prevent knocking for packages. The delivery person's action was following instructions but caused a problem. The user might not be at fault, but there's a gray area. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering her consistent communication and the valid reason (new mom, need for quiet), the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). The delivery person's failure to adapt could be the issue, not her sign.\n"
