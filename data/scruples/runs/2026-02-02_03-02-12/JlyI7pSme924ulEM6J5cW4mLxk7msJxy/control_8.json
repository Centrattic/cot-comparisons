I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about food delivery and a sign they put up. \n\nFirst, the author is a new mom who gets a lot of deliveries. They had signs saying \"Do not knock\" because they didn't want the delivery person to disturb them, maybe because they're with the baby. They tried multiple times to communicate this through notes in the checkout and signs. The problem is that the delivery person kept knocking anyway.\n\nThen, the author found a sign with logos of couriers that worked, but now the food was left at the door and got cold. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to prevent the delivery person from knocking, which they successfully did. However, the consequence was that the food was left outside and became cold. The husband thinks they were asking for it, but the author feels it's about common sense.\n\nNow, considering the rules of the AITA subreddit, the key is whether the author acted unreasonably. The author tried to communicate their request clearly, and the delivery person didn't follow it. The sign with the logos worked for stopping the knock, but the delivery person didn't realize that the sign also applied to food deliveries. The author probably didn't consider that the sign might be too broad, but they had tried other methods that failed. The delivery person's mistake was not realizing the sign's scope, not the author's fault. The author's main issue was about not being knocked, which they achieved. The cold food is an unintended consequence, but the delivery person should have checked if the sign applied to their delivery. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
