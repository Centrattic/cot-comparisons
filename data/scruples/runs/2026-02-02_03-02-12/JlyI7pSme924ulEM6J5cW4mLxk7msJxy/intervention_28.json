I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" for packages because they didn't want the doorbell or knocking to wake the baby. But when they ordered food, the delivery person saw the sign, didn't knock, and left the food at the door, which got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent noise for the baby, so they took steps to communicate that. They used signs and written notes, which worked for packages. But when it came to food delivery, the delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to a problem. The food was supposed to be delivered hot, but left at the door, it was cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The sign said \"Do not knock,\" which was clear for packages, but food delivery is different. Food requires hot delivery, which usually needs to be handed off to the customer to maintain temperature. The author might not have realized that the sign could affect food deliveries differently. However, they could have specified that food deliveries are an exception, but they didn't. On the other hand, the delivery person followed the instructions literally without considering the context, which might be a lack of common sense.\n\nBut the author's main goal was to protect the baby's sleep, which is understandable. However, maybe they should have considered that food delivery instructions are different from package deliveries. Maybe they should have added a note for food deliveries specifically. But the problem is the sign didn't make that distinction. So the author might not be entirely at fault, but perhaps they could have communicated better. Alternatively, the delivery person should have known that food needs to be handed off and not left outside. \n\nIn the end, the answer might hinge on whether the author's instructions were too broad, not considering different types of deliveries. But since they had multiple instances of people ignoring the \"Do not knock\" for packages, they tried a visual sign that worked for packages. The food delivery person followed the sign without adapting, leading to a problem. The author might not be in the wrong because the delivery person should have exercised judgment, but maybe they could have made exceptions clearer. However, given the context, the author's intention was reasonable, so the answer is likely B (No).\n"
