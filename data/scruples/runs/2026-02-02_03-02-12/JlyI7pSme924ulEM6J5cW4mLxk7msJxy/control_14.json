I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages to avoid the delivery person making noise. Initially, she tried handwritten signs, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with corporate logos, which worked in that the delivery person didn't knock, but left the food at the door, which got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which they had a valid reason for\u2014being a new mom, maybe with a baby, so noise is a problem. She tried various methods, and the effective one led to the delivery person not knocking and leaving the food outside. The problem here is that the delivery person didn't check if the food was properly left or maybe didn't follow the usual protocol because of the sign.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she thought common sense would mean the delivery person would ensure the food is delivered properly, even without knocking. But the delivery person took the sign literally and left it at the door, leading to a cold meal. The husband's point is that the sign might have been too direct, leading to the unintended consequence. But the author's intent was to avoid noise, which she had a right to as a new parent.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, is the author in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to use common sense? The delivery person's job is to deliver the food, and maybe they have protocols to follow. But the sign's presence was to prevent knocking. The author might not have considered that the delivery person might not have a way to know if the customer is at home without knocking. So, maybe the author didn't account for that, leading to the problem. However, her main goal was to avoid noise, which is understandable. The delivery person might have been following the sign's instruction too literally. \n\nBut the key point is whether she's in the wrong. Arguably, she set up the sign to avoid knocking, which worked, but didn't anticipate that the delivery person would leave the food without ensuring it was properly delivered. However, expecting the delivery person to use discretion despite the sign might be a fair expectation. Alternatively, the author could have found a different method, like using a cooler or a safe spot for the food. The sign might have been too direct, leading to the problem. But the author's intention was valid. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she had a legitimate need to avoid noise, and the delivery person's actions were a bit too literal. However, she might not have considered all aspects of the delivery process. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she had a good reason and the delivery person didn't act as she expected, maybe the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The husband's opinion is that they were asking for it, but the author's intent was reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
