I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with lots of deliveries. She had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but they were ignored. She also wrote that in delivery notes. Then she used a sign with corporate logos, maybe to indicate that the delivery should be left at the door. It worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the deliverer left the food at the door, which got cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nHmm. So the key issue here is whether expecting the delivery person to knock for food makes sense. The signs were for packages, not food. Maybe the author didn't make it clear that the \"do not knock\" instruction only applies to packages, not food. The delivery person might have assumed the sign was for all deliveries. The author might have been unclear in her instructions, leading to the mistake. On the other hand, the delivery person might have known that food should be left at the door, which is standard practice. But the author argues that common sense should have been used, like knocking if the door was unlocked or someone was home. However, since the sign was there, maybe the delivery person followed the instructions literally. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But perhaps the author didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, leading to confusion. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not being clear about the different handling for food versus packages.\n"
