I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault. The scenario is about a new mom who's had packages delivered and kept getting knocked on the door, despite her instructions not to. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and tried different methods, which eventually worked. But then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, and it got cold. Her husband said they were asking for it, and she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her attempts to prevent knocking, the sign that worked for packages, and the food delivery mishap. The sign had corporate logos, which might be specific to packages, not food. Food deliveries might have different protocols, like needing to knock to ensure someone is home, especially if the recipient prefers to receive hot food immediately. The delivery person might follow the sign's instruction literally, but in doing so, didn't account for the perishable nature of the food. However, the sign's purpose was to avoid disturbances, which is understandable for a new mom. \n\nBut the problem here is that the food got cold. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but the result was a negative outcome. So, is she at fault for not considering that food might need a different approach? Or is the delivery person at fault for not using common sense? The user's husband thinks they were asking for it, implying that putting up the sign led to the problem. However, the user argues that common sense should have prevailed. \n\nI think the main issue is that the sign was intended for packages, not food. The delivery person might have assumed the same instructions applied to all deliveries, but the food delivery requires immediate delivery. The user might not be in the wrong because she had valid reasons to avoid knocking (as a new mom), but the sign's application might have been too broad. However, she should have specified that the sign is for packages only. Since she didn't, the delivery person followed the sign's instructions, leading to the cold food. So maybe she's partially at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope. But the delivery person also didn't use judgment. But the question is whether the author is at fault. Since she put up the sign without specifying exceptions, she might share some responsibility. But given the context of being a new mom and needing peace, maybe it's not entirely her fault. The answer could be a bit nuanced, but the options are A or B. Considering that the sign was effective for packages but caused issues for food, maybe the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because she had a legitimate need, but the delivery person should have used common sense. However, if the sign was too ambiguous, then part of the fault is hers. But the community often sides with the person setting clear boundaries unless there's a clear misunderstanding. The sign had corporate logos, maybe indicating it's for package deliveries, but the food delivery person didn't check. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B because the user's intent was to avoid disturbances, and the delivery person should have known that food requires a different handling. She didn't mean to exclude food, but the sign didn't specify. However, she should have made that clear. But given the context of being a new mom, maybe the answer is B. Alternatively, A might be correct if the sign was too vague. I'm a bit torn but think B is more likely.\n"
