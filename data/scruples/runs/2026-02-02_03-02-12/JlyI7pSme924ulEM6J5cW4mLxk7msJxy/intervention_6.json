I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions not to. She put up signs and notes, but they were ignored. Then she used a specific sign with courier logos, which worked for package deliveries, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door and it got cold. She's asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, she made every effort to communicate her preference not to be knocked on. She used multiple signs and wrote notes in delivery options. The fact that the delivery person followed the sign for packages but not for food is a bit confusing. Maybe the food delivery service has different protocols. But the sign was general, with courier logos, so maybe the food delivery person didn't realize it was relevant. However, the sign was there for all couriers. \n\nThe result was that the food was left outside and got cold. The user is upset, and her husband says they asked for it. The user argues that common sense should have prevailed. The key here is whether expecting the delivery person to use judgment (not leave perishable food outside) is reasonable. \n\nOn one hand, the sign was there, but maybe the delivery person didn't consider that the sign applied to food deliveries. On the other, the user had a valid reason (maybe a baby inside, not wanting to be disturbed) for not wanting to be knocked on. The delivery person's job is to deliver food, which requires timely and safe delivery. Leaving it outside in the cold is a problem, but so is knocking and disturbing the household. \n\nI think the user is not in the wrong because she communicated her instructions clearly and the sign was effective for packages. The delivery person might have misinterpreted the sign's scope or didn't exercise judgment. However, the user's solution had unintended consequences. But she's a new mom, so her primary concern is the baby's well-being, which is valid. The delivery person should have used common sense to ensure the food wasn't left out. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
