I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock instead of leaving it at the door. The situation involves a new mom who has a history of packages being left outside, so she put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" to prevent that. But when she ordered food, the deliverer followed the sign and left it at the door even when she was home, resulting in cold food.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent packages from being left outside. They used signs and notes, which worked for packages but not for food. The food deliverer followed the same instruction, which led to an unintended consequence. The key here is that the author's sign was meant for packages, not for food deliveries. Maybe the signs were too generic. The deliverer might not have differentiated between a package and a food order, especially if the sign just said \"Do not knock\" without specifying that it's for packages only. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" makes sense because the sign was a general instruction. The deliverer followed it literally. The author's frustration comes from not having the food delivered properly, but the problem is with the sign's wording. The author might be in the wrong because the sign wasn't clear and the deliverer followed the instructions as given. However, the deliverer could have also used judgment to knock if it's a food delivery, but maybe the instructions were too strict. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's sign was ambiguous, leading to a misunderstanding. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not specifying that the instruction applies only to packages. Answer A (author is in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
