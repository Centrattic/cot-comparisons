I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to prevent her packages from being knocked on the door. The delivery people ignored the written instructions, so she switched to a sign with pictures of the courier logos, which worked\u2014until she ordered food and the delivery person left it outside, resulting in the food being cold.\n\nFirst, the key points: she's a new mom, dealing with many deliveries. She tried clear written instructions but they were ignored. Then she used a visual sign that worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery. The main issue is that the food delivery person followed the sign and left the food outside, leading to it being cold. The husband says they were \"asking for it,\" and she questions if common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? The sign was meant to prevent noise for packages, but food delivery is different. Maybe she should have made a distinction between packages and food. The sign didn't specify, so the delivery person followed the same rule for both. But she might not have considered that food needs to be handed over, not left outside. However, the delivery person didn't question it, which could be their fault. The sign was effective for packages but not for food. \n\nOn the other hand, the user had a valid reason to avoid noise, especially as a new mom. But maybe the sign was too broad. The problem is that the sign's instructions were too general. She didn't account for the different handling needs of food. The delivery person might have assumed it was the same as a package but didn't communicate. So, the author might be partially at fault for not specifying, but the delivery person's lack of communication is also an issue. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the situation, the author's intention was reasonable, but the outcome was unintended. She might not be in the wrong because the delivery person didn't adapt the instructions based on the context of the food delivery. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a balance here. The sign was ambiguous, so she's partially responsible. But the delivery person's failure to adapt is also a factor. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key is whether her instructions were too vague. Since she didn't specify for food, maybe she's not in the wrong. The delivery person should have used judgment. Hence, B is the answer.\n"
