I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The author is a new mom with many packages, so she put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby. She tried multiple times through notes and signs, which worked for packages but not for food. Then she used a sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem when the food delivery person left it at the door, making it cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. She wanted to prevent the baby from being disturbed, so her signs were meant to keep deliveries quiet. The fact that the food delivery person followed the package instructions (not knocking) shows they followed the sign's directions. However, food deliveries typically require a different handling\u2014like a warm meal\u2014so maybe the author's sign didn't account for that. She might not have specified different instructions for food versus packages. \n\nBut the sign was general, so the deliverer might not have known to treat food differently. The author expects common sense, but maybe the deliverer just followed the sign literally. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests frustration, but the author's situation as a new mom is relatable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She set clear instructions, but perhaps didn't consider that food needs a different approach. However, the deliverer did follow the instructions as given. So the problem is more about the sign not being specific enough for different delivery types. The author might not be in the wrong because she tried multiple ways to communicate, and the deliverer acted on the information provided. The cold food is an unintended consequence, but it's a communication gap rather than intentional wrongdoing. So the answer is B (No).\n"
