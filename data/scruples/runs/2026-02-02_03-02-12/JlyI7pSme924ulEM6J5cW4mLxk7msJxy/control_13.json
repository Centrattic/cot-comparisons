I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying not to knock, but then when a food delivery didn't knock and left the package at the door, it was cold. The author is upset about that, but her husband says they were asking for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mom has a history of packages being knocked on the door despite her instructions. She used written signs and notes in the checkout, but they were ignored. So she put up a sign with courier logos that worked for packages, but when it came to food delivery, the delivery person didn't knock and left the food outside, which got cold. Now she's frustrated, and the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo the main issue is whether expecting the delivery person to knock, despite her previous signs, is reasonable. The sign was effective for packages, but food is different. Packages can be left, but food might need to be delivered hot and quickly. The sign didn't specify exceptions for food, so maybe the delivery person followed the same procedure for all deliveries. The mom didn't anticipate that the sign might affect food deliveries differently. \n\nThe husband's point is that they were asking for it because they put up the sign. The author argues that common sense should have made the delivery person knock for food. However, the sign was clear, and the delivery person followed it. The problem is the sign was too broad. The author might be in the wrong for not considering that different types of deliveries might require different handling. \n\nBut on the other hand, she had a legitimate reason to prevent packages from being knocked on the door, maybe to avoid waking the baby or causing a mess. However, food delivery typically requires a different approach. Maybe she should have specified that the sign doesn't apply to food. Alternatively, she could have communicated more clearly. Since the sign was in place, the delivery person might not have known to make an exception. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not clarifying the sign's exceptions. The delivery person followed instructions, leading to the problem. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering the different needs of food delivery versus packages. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because her sign was too general and she didn't specify that food deliveries should be handled differently.\n"
