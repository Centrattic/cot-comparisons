I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who has been trying to prevent delivery people from knocking on her door by using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" Initially, these were ignored, so she used a more explicit sign with corporate logos, which worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, leading to it being cold and late.\n\nSo, the author is wondering if they're the asshole here. The husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. She's a new mom, possibly dealing with the stress of having packages delivered while taking care of a baby. The signs were meant to prevent disturbances, which is understandable. However, using a sign that's so effective that even food delivery (which typically requires interaction) is affected might be an unintended consequence. \n\nThe key points here are the expectations of the delivery service. Food delivery usually requires someone to answer the door, whereas packages can be left at the door. The author's sign might have been too broad, not distinguishing between package deliveries and food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, hence not knocking, but that led to the food being cold. \n\nIs the author at fault for not considering that different types of deliveries might have different requirements? Maybe. She didn't specify that the no-knock policy was only for packages. The delivery person did follow the instructions given, so the problem might be that the sign was too general. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person's job is to ensure the food is delivered properly, which might involve knocking to confirm receipt. The author's sign may have misled them into thinking all deliveries should be left at the door regardless of type. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not tailoring the instructions for different delivery types. The delivery person did their job based on the sign, but the sign's ambiguity caused the issue. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the nuances between different delivery services.\n"
