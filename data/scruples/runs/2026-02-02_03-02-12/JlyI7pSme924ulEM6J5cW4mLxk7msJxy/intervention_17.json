I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with constant package deliveries. She's been clear about not wanting the delivery people to knock by writing \"Do not Knock\" on signs and in delivery notes. But despite that, they kept knocking. So she found a new sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages but messed up when a food delivery came. The food was left out in the cold and got cold. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. She tried multiple times to communicate her preference. The new sign was effective for packages, which is good. But the food delivery was a different scenario. Food needs to be warm, so knocking to hand it over makes sense. However, the sign might have been interpreted as a general rule for all deliveries, not just packages. The delivery person followed the sign literally, which caused an issue.\n\nWas the author wrong? She wanted to avoid noise, which is understandable for a new mom. But maybe she should have specified that the sign was only for packages. The sign had courier logos, which might not distinguish between food and other deliveries. The problem is that the sign was too broad. She assumed the delivery person would use common sense, but the person followed the instructions as given. So perhaps the author didn't foresee that the sign could apply to food deliveries, leading to an unintended consequence. But she did mention in her notes \"Do not Knock\" in the delivery options, which might not have been seen by the food delivery person. \n\nOn the other hand, the food delivery person might have assumed that since the sign was up, it applied to all deliveries. The author's husband called them out for \"asking for it,\" which adds another layer. The key is whether the author's instructions were clear enough. Since the sign didn't specify exceptions, maybe she's partly at fault for not making the distinction. However, the main intent was to prevent knocking for packages, not food. The delivery person's job is to ensure food is delivered properly, so they should have used judgment. The cold food is the delivery person's mistake for not exercising common sense. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards her not being in the wrong because the sign was for packages, and the delivery person should have adjusted for food.\n"
