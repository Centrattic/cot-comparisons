I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for package deliveries because she didn't want delivery people to knock on her door. She tried various methods, including writing notes on the packages and using a sign with logos. The sign worked for packages, but when she used it for a food delivery, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, and it got cold. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was to prevent delivery people from knocking, which she did by using signs. She had clear instructions. The delivery person followed the instructions literally by not knocking and left the food unattended. The problem here is that food delivery typically requires someone to be present to receive it, especially if it's something that needs to be handed over immediately, like hot food. Packages can be left at the door, but food might not be safe if left out. The sign might have been misinterpreted or applied to all deliveries, not just packages. The delivery person might have thought the same rule applied here, but that led to an issue.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, not food. So maybe she didn't communicate clearly enough. On the other hand, the delivery person should have used some judgment. If the food needs to be received, maybe they should knock even if there's a sign against it. But the sign said \"Do not Knock,\" so the delivery person might have thought they were following instructions. However, in some places, food delivery services might have their own protocols. For example, if the customer doesn't answer the door, they might leave a note or try to contact them. But in this case, the delivery was left unattended, which caused the problem.\n\nThe author might have been too rigid. Even though she had reasons (being a new mom, maybe needing quiet or not being home to answer), the sign didn't differentiate between package and food delivery. The husband's point is that they were asking for it because they didn't consider that different types of deliveries might require different handling. The key here is whether the author's instructions were clear enough. If the sign was intended for packages only, maybe she should have specified that. Since it's a sign that's visible to all, maybe it's ambiguous. The delivery person might not know the context of the sign, thinking it applies to all deliveries.\n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used common sense. Even if the sign says not to knock, if the item is food that requires immediate attention, they should knock or find another way to ensure it's received properly. But the sign explicitly says not to knock, so they might feel they have to follow it. There's a conflict between following written instructions and using judgment. In this case, maybe the delivery person didn't use enough judgment. But the author also didn't make the instructions specific enough.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might share some responsibility for not clarifying that the sign was only for packages. But the delivery person also should have assessed the situation. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is B (No). The main reason is that the author's communication wasn't specific, but she had a valid reason for the sign. The delivery person's mistake was not using common sense. The author isn't entirely at fault here. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but the answer leans towards B.\n"
