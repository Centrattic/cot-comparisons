I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author is a new mom with lots of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but people kept knocking. Then she used a sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door, which was cold. The husband said it was their fault, but the author thinks common sense should've been used.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the author's actions were reasonable. She had a history of people ignoring her \"Do not Knock\" signs, so she switched to a more effective sign. However, this sign might have only applied to packages, not food. The delivery person might not have realized that the \"Do not Knock\" rule was for packages only. Or maybe the sign was too general.\n\nThe author expected the delivery person to use common sense and knock for food but not for packages. But the delivery person followed the sign literally, leading to the food being cold. The husband thinks they're at fault for not clarifying. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she had a legitimate reason to not want people knocking (maybe a baby sleeping?), but maybe she should've specified that the \"Do not Knock\" was only for packages. Her sign might have been ambiguous. The delivery person followed the instructions but didn't consider that food delivery might be different. \n\nBut then again, food is time-sensitive and requires more care. The delivery person might not have had a note explaining that. The author did try to communicate through checkout notes, but they were ignored. So maybe the sign was a last resort. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely at fault. The delivery person should've used some judgment, but maybe the sign was unclear. The husband's point is that the sign was there, so they got what they asked for. However, expecting someone to use common sense in following instructions could be a middle ground. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because she had a history of people ignoring her notes and the sign worked for packages. The delivery person should've recognized that food needs to be handled differently, even with the sign. The problem might be in the sign's clarity, but not necessarily the author's intent.\n"
