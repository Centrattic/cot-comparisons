I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door after they created a sign that said not to knock for packages, but which was also seen by food delivery people. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with many packages. They had signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but these were ignored. So they created a new sign with logos of the courier companies, which worked for packages but caused an issue with food delivery. The food delivery person saw the sign and left the food at the door, which was ice cold when they noticed it was late.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author's intention was to prevent package deliveries from knocking, which they had previously asked not to do. They used a sign that inadvertently affected food delivery. The food deliverer followed the sign's instruction and left it at the door without knocking, leading to the food being cold.\n\nThe author expects that the deliverer should use common sense to knock for food, which is typically expected. The husband's comment adds another angle. \n\nOn one hand, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to follow the delivery instructions they had set for packages, which worked as intended. The food delivery situation might be an unintended consequence. On the other hand, maybe the author should have considered that food delivery usually requires a different handling (like knocking) compared to packages. The sign might have been too broad, not differentiating between package and food deliveries.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author's expectation of the deliverer to knock for food is reasonable. The author had repeatedly specified \"Do not knock\" for packages, but food delivery usually involves a person waiting to receive the food, so common sense would suggest knocking. The deliverer did follow the sign's instruction, which the author created, but maybe the author didn't account for different types of deliveries. However, the sign's purpose was for packages, not food. The confusion here is between packages and food. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't explicitly state exceptions for food. The deliverer might have misinterpreted the sign, but the author's intent was clear for packages. The issue is the sign's ambiguity. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they can't be blamed for the deliverer's mistake in applying the sign to food. Alternatively, maybe they should have anticipated that the sign could affect food deliveries and adjusted accordingly. But since the sign included courier logos that might not cover food services, it's unclear. The deliverer might belong to a different service, but the sign's presence could have led them to follow it regardless. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's main issue was the sign's ambiguity. They might not be in the wrong because they tried to prevent unwanted knocking for packages, which worked, but the food delivery was an unintended consequence. The deliverer should have used common sense to knock for food, even if the sign said not to. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
