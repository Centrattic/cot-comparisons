I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for package deliveries. She got tired of people knocking, so she put up a sign with courier logos. It worked for packages, but then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door, and it was cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The key points here are the sign's intent and the context. The sign was specifically for packages, right? She mentioned that the sign worked for packages, which probably means that couriers would leave packages at the door without knocking. But when it came to a food delivery, the delivery person followed the same instruction, even though food delivery is different. Food typically needs to be given directly to the customer to stay warm or fresh.\n\nThe author expected the delivery person to use common sense and not follow the sign for food, but the delivery person didn't. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting the delivery person to distinguish between packages and food. \n\nOn one hand, the sign didn't specify that it's only for packages. Maybe the food delivery person didn't realize the sign was only for packages. The author had written \"Do not Knock\" for packages in the notes before, but the sign was more prominent. So maybe the sign was too general.\n\nOn the other hand, food delivery is a different service. The usual protocol is to knock or call, so the delivery person might have followed the sign out of context. The author might have assumed the delivery person would know the difference, but maybe that's not a safe assumption.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sign didn't clarify that it's only for packages, then perhaps the author didn't communicate clearly. However, the husband's comment about \"asking for it\" might imply that the sign caused the problem. The author's intention was to prevent knocking for packages, but the sign affected all deliveries. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not specifying the sign's scope. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment. \n\nBut the answer depends on whether the author's instructions were clear. Since the sign had images of courier logos and said \"Do not Knock,\" it's possible that food couriers might not have been part of that. Wait, the sign in the image (which I can't see, but the user provided a link) might show all courier logos. If the food delivery service is part of those logos, then the sign would apply. If not, maybe not. But the user says the sign worked \"too well,\" implying that all couriers followed it. So the food delivery person might have been part of the same courier services, leading them to follow the sign. In that case, the author's sign caused the issue because they didn't specify exceptions for food deliveries.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because the sign was too broad and didn't account for different types of deliveries. They should have communicated that the \"Do not Knock\" instruction was only for packages, not food. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
