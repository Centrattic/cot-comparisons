I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby when people deliver packages. She got a sign that worked, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and the food was cold.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. As a new mom, she's probably very sensitive to noise and wants to keep her baby's environment calm. She's taken multiple steps to communicate her preference: handwritten signs, notes in the delivery options, everything. The issue is that the delivery person didn't knock, which led to the food being left out and getting cold.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and expectations. The author clearly communicated her request, but the delivery person didn't follow it. However, in the case of food delivery, the standard practice is usually to leave the food at the door unless specified otherwise. The sign might have been interpreted as applying to packages, not food deliveries. So maybe the author didn't make her instructions clear enough for different types of deliveries.\n\nBut the problem is that the sign worked \"too well,\" leading to the food being left out. The author's husband thinks they were asking for it, implying that by putting up the sign, they should have anticipated this. But the author is arguing that common sense should have prevailed\u2014like the delivery person should have called or checked if someone was home, even if the sign said not to knock.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely at fault. She's in a situation where she needs to protect her baby, and she tried multiple ways to communicate her needs. However, maybe she didn't consider that different delivery types (packages vs. food) might require different handling. The delivery person might have followed the sign's instruction literally but didn't exercise judgment. So the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. The delivery person could have used common sense. But maybe the author should have specified that the sign applies to packages only, not food. However, given the context of being a new mom, her needs are valid, and the delivery person should have checked if possible. \n\nIn the end, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The sign was meant to prevent disturbances, and the delivery person should have adapted, especially when delivering food which might require immediate attention. The husband's comment that they were asking for it is a bit harsh because the author's intention was to avoid noise, not to cause inconvenience with food. So the answer is B.\n"
