I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is at fault here. So, the situation is that they're a new mom with a lot of packages. They kept getting deliveries where the drivers would knock on the door even though they had signs saying \"Do not Knock.\" They tried writing notes in the delivery instructions, but that didn't work either. Then they found a sign with the courier logos, and that worked\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But then when they ordered food, the driver left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, and the author is wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's main issue was that delivery people were knocking, which is a problem for a new mom, maybe because of the baby needing quiet or something. So they tried different ways to stop that. The sign worked for packages, but when it came to food delivery, the same approach caused an issue. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's actions were reasonable. They were trying to prevent knocking, which they had a legitimate reason for. Using a sign with courier logos was a visual cue that worked for packages. But food delivery is different. Maybe the driver didn't check the sign because they were in a hurry, or perhaps they didn't notice it. The problem here is that the sign might be too broad\u2014it applies to all couriers, including food delivery, which requires immediate handling. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting that the food delivery person would use common sense? The author argues that common sense should prevail, but the driver might not have recognized the sign for food delivery or didn't consider that leaving it outside would cause the food to get cold. The author might have assumed that all delivery types would respect the sign, but food delivery is time-sensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did make an effort to communicate their request in multiple ways. The fact that the sign worked for packages suggests that the drivers followed it, but the food delivery driver either missed it or didn't apply the same logic. The husband's point is that by having the sign, they were asking for it. If the sign is a clear instruction, then the driver followed it correctly, and the author's expectation that they should override the sign for food is a new variable they didn't account for. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that different types of deliveries require different handling. The sign was effective in preventing knocking for packages, but for food, it's necessary to knock to ensure the food is delivered properly. The author's solution was a one-size-fits-all approach, which didn't account for the nuances of different delivery types. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't anticipate that food delivery would need a different approach.\n"
