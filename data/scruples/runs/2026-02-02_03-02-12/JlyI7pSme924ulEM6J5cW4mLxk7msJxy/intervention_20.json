I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions to the contrary. She put up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock,\" but they were ignored. Then she found a sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person followed the same instruction, leaving the food at the door where it got cold.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the author tried multiple times to communicate that she didn't want to be disturbed, which is understandable, especially as a new mom. The sign worked for packages, so she expected it to work for food deliveries too. However, the delivery person followed the same instruction, leading to a problem because food needs to be handed over promptly.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intention was to avoid disturbances, which is reasonable. She took steps to communicate her needs. On the other hand, the sign might have been ambiguous or not specific enough to differentiate between packages and food deliveries. The delivery person might not have realized that the instruction applied only to packages and not to food orders. \n\nBut in the context, the author had used the same sign for packages, and when she ordered food from the same courier, the delivery person followed the same instruction. The food delivery person might not have checked if the sign was specific to packages. The problem arises because the instruction was followed literally, but the consequence was negative. The author's husband thinks they were asking for it, but the author argues common sense should have been applied. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author did convey her preferences, but maybe the sign wasn't clear enough. However, the delivery person acted on the given instruction, which was to not knock. The issue is that the author expected the delivery person to use judgment, but the instruction was explicit. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because she followed the available means to communicate her request. The delivery person should have assessed the situation and maybe checked if the instruction applied to food deliveries. However, there's a possibility that the sign was too generic, leading to misunderstanding. \n\nBut given the circumstances, the author's main goal was to prevent disturbances, which is valid. The delivery person's job is to follow instructions, even if there's a potential downside. However, the author's frustration is understandable because the consequence was significant (cold food). \n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies partly with the delivery person for not using common sense in this case. The author did her part to communicate, and while the sign might have been unclear, the delivery person should have recognized that food delivery requires immediate handoff. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
