I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" to avoid disturbing her baby. But when she later wanted someone to knock for a food delivery, the deliverer didn't, leading to a cold meal.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent disturbances for her baby, which is understandable. She used signs and notes to communicate this. However, for the food delivery, she wanted someone to knock so she could answer quickly. The problem is that the deliverer didn't knock, even though there was a sign they might have seen. The husband says they \"asked for it,\" implying that the signs were too broad.\n\nThe key points are: the author's signs were meant to prevent knocks, but when they worked too well (i.e., the deliverer didn't knock), the food was left outside and got cold. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid reason to prevent knocks for packages, but when getting food, she might have needed someone to knock. Maybe she should have used a different sign for packages vs. food deliveries. On the other hand, the deliverer followed the sign's instruction even though the context might have changed. However, common sense might suggest that food delivery requires a knock to allow the recipient to accept it immediately, unlike packages that can be left.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the existing signs were too generic, leading to unintended consequences. She might have been in the wrong for not specifying different instructions for food vs. packages. The husband's point is valid here. However, the deliverer also didn't use judgment and just followed the sign without considering the situation. But since the sign was there, maybe the deliverer was just doing their job. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the user often gets the blame if their actions, though well-intentioned, cause unintended problems. Here, the author's signs were effective but not specific enough. She could have added a note for food deliveries, but she didn't. So, she might be at fault for not clarifying. Alternatively, the deliverer should have used common sense. However, the deliverer followed exact instructions, which were to not knock. So, the root cause is the author's sign being too broad. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance. But since AITA often holds the person's actions responsible even if unintended, maybe A is correct. However, the user might argue that common sense should override the sign in this case. But signs are meant to be followed literally. Hmm. I think the answer is A because her signs were too broad and caused the problem, even if unintended.\n"
