And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting packages and has been trying to prevent knocking by using signs and notes saying \"Do not knock.\" But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, causing the food to be cold.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author had signs and notes to prevent knocking for packages, which worked for packages but not for food delivery. The food delivery person saw the sign and left it at the door, which the author wasn't expecting. Now, the author is upset because the food was cold, and her husband says they were asking for it. The author feels that common sense should have been used.\n\nSo, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author made clear instructions not to knock, which the delivery person followed. Since the sign was there, maybe the delivery person assumed not to knock even for food. But food delivery usually requires someone to be present to receive it, so maybe the delivery person should have knocked regardless. The author's intention was to prevent packages from being left at the door, but food is different because it's perishable and needs to be handed over immediately. \n\nThe author's mistake might be using the same sign for both packages and food. If the sign was specific to packages, maybe the delivery person would have known to knock for food. However, the sign had pictures of courier logos, which might not distinguish between package deliveries and food deliveries. The delivery person might not have known that the \"Do not knock\" instruction didn't apply to food. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he believes the author's own sign caused the problem. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have knocked regardless of the sign. But the delivery person followed the instructions given, which were to not knock. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's instructions were clear, but perhaps they didn't consider that food deliveries might require a different approach. The delivery person adhered strictly to the sign, leading to the issue. However, the delivery person might not have realized that the sign wasn't applicable to food. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit ambiguous. The author's instructions led to the problem, but the delivery person also had a duty to ensure the food was delivered properly. Since food is perishable and usually requires immediate attention, maybe the delivery person should have knocked despite the sign. Alternatively, the author should have specified that the \"Do not knock\" rule was only for packages. The answer might hinge on whether the sign was clear enough to differentiate between package and food deliveries. If the sign was ambiguous, the author might share some responsibility. If the delivery person misinterpreted the instructions, that's on them. However, since the author explicitly mentioned the sign worked too well and didn't specify exceptions, it's possible the author is at least partially at fault. But since the delivery person followed the given instructions, maybe the author's expectations were a bit unrealistic. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't account for the different nature of food deliveries, leading to the problem.\n"
