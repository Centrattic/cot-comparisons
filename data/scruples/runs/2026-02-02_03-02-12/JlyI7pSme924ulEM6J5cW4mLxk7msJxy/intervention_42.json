I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" to prevent delivery people from knocking on the door. She had various versions of the sign, but they kept getting ignored. Then she used a sign with corporate logos, which worked to stop the knocking, but then when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door and it got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main goal was to prevent knocking, which was causing issues. They tried multiple methods, like notes in checkout and signs. The sign with logos worked, but the delivery person didn't knock, leading to the food being cold. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong, but they want to confirm. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author tried to communicate clearly through multiple channels. Using the logo sign might have been a good strategy to ensure delivery people followed the instructions. However, maybe the sign was too broad, applying to all deliveries, including food. Food deliveries typically require knocking to ensure someone is there to receive the order, so not knocking might lead to problems like the food getting cold. The author might not have considered that different types of deliveries have different needs. So, even though their intention was to stop knocking, the sign might have been misinterpreted or applied incorrectly to food deliveries. \n\nBut the author did specify \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes for packages, but food delivery is different. The sign with corporate logos might have been intended for package deliveries, not food. The delivery person might have assumed the same rule applied to all deliveries. The author might not have made the distinction clear between packages and food. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used their judgment and knocked for food, even with the sign. \n\nConsidering common sense, when you order food, it's expected that someone will be present to receive it. Leaving it at the door could lead to mishaps. The author might have overgeneralized the \"Do not knock\" rule, not accounting for different delivery types. However, the delivery person's priority might be following the sign, even if it's food. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author tried to communicate their preferences clearly, but perhaps didn't account for different delivery types. The delivery person followed the instructions but didn't use judgment for the specific situation. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's a lesson in differentiating between package and food delivery instructions. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" might be harsh. The author's intent was to avoid knocking, but the outcome was unintended. The wrong here could be shared, but the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they made their preferences clear, but the delivery person didn't adapt, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the sign was too broad, maybe they are slightly responsible. However, the sign's effectiveness in stopping knocking for packages shows it worked as intended. The food delivery issue was an unforeseen consequence. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
