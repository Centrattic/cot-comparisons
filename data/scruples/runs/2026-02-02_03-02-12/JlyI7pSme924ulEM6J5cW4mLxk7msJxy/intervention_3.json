I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who has been dealing with delivery people knocking on her door despite explicit instructions not to. She's used multiple methods to communicate this: handwritten signs, notes in checkout carts, etc. Eventually, she finds a sign with corporate logos that works, but it leads to a problem when the food delivery is left at the door and gets cold.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are communication and intent. She tried various ways to stop the knocking, which was important to her, possibly because of being a new mom (maybe noise sensitivity, or need for quiet). The sign with logos was effective, but it caused the delivery person to leave the food at the door. The consequence is the food was cold, but the delivery person didn't knock.\n\nIs her expectation reasonable? She wanted no knocking for packages, which the sign achieved. However, food delivery might be different from packages. Packages can be left at the door, but food is time-sensitive. However, she still specified no knocking, which the delivery person followed. The problem is the result of following the instructions, not ignoring them.\n\nThe husband says they were asking for it, implying that using the sign was a bad idea. The author thinks common sense should have prevailed, meaning the delivery person should have realized that food needs to be delivered promptly and maybe knocked anyway despite the sign. But the sign was specific to not knocking, so maybe the delivery person was just following orders.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author's intent was to prevent knocking, which was achieved. The unintended consequence was the cold food. So is she at fault? Or is the delivery person at fault for strictly following the sign without using judgment? The author's actions were to follow through with a method that worked for previous deliveries (no knocking for packages), not anticipating that food might require a different approach. But perhaps the sign didn't differentiate between package deliveries and food. The sign's design might have been too general. \n\nIn such cases, the person who set the instructions (the author) is responsible for the outcome if the instructions are followed. If the instructions are clear and the delivery person complies, the responsibility lies with the author for not considering the specific needs of food delivery. Alternatively, if the sign was too ambiguous or if the delivery person should have used their discretion despite the sign, then the delivery person might be at fault. \n\nBut the author's intent was to prevent knocking, which is reasonable. The problem is that food delivery requires a different handling. The author might not have considered that food needs a different approach, but she can't be expected to know how every delivery person will interpret the sign. The delivery person's job is to follow the instructions given. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because she followed proper channels to communicate her request, and the result was an unintended consequence of the delivery person strictly following the instructions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
