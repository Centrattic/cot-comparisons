I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite multiple signs and notes saying \"Do not Knock.\" She even created a sign with logos of the courier companies, which worked for packages but caused a problem when a food delivery was left outside and got cold.\n\nFirst, the main point is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to not knock. She had clear instructions and signs, but in this case, the delivery person didn't knock, leading to the food being left out and getting cold. Her husband says they were asking for it, implying that the sign might have caused the issue.\n\nOn one hand, she's using the sign to prevent delivery people from knocking, which she had a problem with before. She put in effort to communicate her preference multiple times. The sign worked for packages, so she might have expected it to work for food too. However, food delivery usually requires more immediate attention to maintain temperature, which might not be the same as packages. The delivery person might have assumed that since the food is time-sensitive, knocking wasn't necessary but leaving it outside could still risk it getting cold. Maybe the sign was too strict for food deliveries, which need a different handling than packages.\n\nBut then again, the author's intention was to avoid the noise and disruption from knocking, which is understandable, especially for a new mom. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction by not knocking and left it at the door, but that's not ideal for food. However, common sense would dictate that food shouldn't be left outside where it can get cold. So maybe the delivery person should have used judgment despite the sign.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the sign to work for food. If the sign's purpose was to prevent knocking, which it did, but the consequence was unintended (food getting cold), maybe the author didn't account for the different handling needs between packages and food. However, the delivery person should have known that food requires more care. So the blame might be shared, but the author's primary intention was to stop knocking, which she did. The delivery person's mistake was not ensuring the food was properly left, maybe by using a warmer container or checking if the recipient was home.\n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the wrong because she created a sign that led to the food being mishandled. But she didn't expect the delivery person to ignore the time-sensitive nature of food. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the delivery person followed the instructions given, but the outcome was bad, the fault might lie with the delivery person for not using common sense. The author's intention was valid, so she's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
