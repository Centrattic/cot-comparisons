I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a new mom, has been getting a lot of packages. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" because she didn't want the delivery people to knock, maybe to avoid disturbing her baby or being woken up. The delivery people kept knocking despite the signs and notes in the delivery options.\n\nThen she got a new sign with pictures of the courier logos, which worked too well. When they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and left it at the door. The food was cold, and now she's upset. Her husband says they were asking for it, but she thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? Answer A or B. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she did for a good reason as a new mom. She tried multiple times to communicate this through notes and signs. The delivery people ignored her instructions. Then she got a more effective sign, but the outcome was that the food delivery person left it at the door without knocking, leading to the food being cold.\n\nIs she in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to follow the sign? Well, the sign was clearly for package deliveries, not food. So maybe the author didn't consider that the sign might apply to food deliveries too. But she included the courier logos, which might be for all services under that company. The delivery person might have taken the sign literally and not knocked, even for food. The problem is that in food delivery, knocking is usually expected to ensure someone is there to receive it. Leaving food at the door can lead to cold meals, which is what happened here.\n\nSo the author's sign might have been too broad, not differentiating between packages and food. She might have assumed the delivery person would use common sense to knock for food, but the sign prevented that. On the other hand, the delivery person followed the sign exactly, which was the author's goal for packages. But maybe the author should have realized that food deliveries require different handling. So is she in the wrong for not making that distinction? Or is the delivery person at fault for not using judgment?\n\nHer husband says they were asking for it, implying that they caused the problem by putting up the sign. The author argues that common sense should have prevailed. But the delivery person might not have considered that the sign might not apply to food. So maybe the author didn't consider the different contexts, leading to the issue. Therefore, she could be at fault for not anticipating that the sign would affect food deliveries. So answer A, she is in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person shouldn't have ignored the sign for food, but the sign's purpose was to prevent knocking for packages. It's a bit of a gray area. Hmm.\n\nAnother angle: The author's main issue was with packages, not food. She might have expected that food delivery would still require knocking. However, she included the sign with courier logos, which might have been intended for all deliveries. The delivery person followed the instruction, but the consequence wasn't intended. So maybe the author didn't consider that the sign would apply to food. Therefore, she's not in the wrong because her intention was for packages, but the sign's wording was unclear. Wait, the sign has \"Do not knock for packages.\" But the link image isn't available, but the user says it had courier logos. Maybe the sign said \"Do not knock\" in general. If the sign was meant for all deliveries, then the delivery person followed it, even for food. But the author didn't expect that. So maybe she's at fault for not making the sign specific. So answer A. Alternatively, answer B if the sign was for packages, and the delivery person shouldn't have applied it to food. But without seeing the sign's exact wording, it's a bit tricky. The user says she had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations. Then she got a sign with logos that had \"Do not knock\" and it worked too well. So maybe the sign was for all deliveries, and the delivery person followed it for food. Hence, the author's sign was too broad, leading to the problem. So she's in the wrong for not considering different types of deliveries. Therefore, answer A.\n"
