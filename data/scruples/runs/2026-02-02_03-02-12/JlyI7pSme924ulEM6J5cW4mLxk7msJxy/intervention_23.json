I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock. The situation is that they're a new mom with lots of packages, and they had signs saying not to knock, which were ignored. Then they used a more prominent sign with courier logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem with food delivery.\n\nFirst, the author tried multiple times to communicate \"do not knock\" via written notes, both on signs and in delivery options. The deliverers didn't follow it, so they made a more visible sign. The sign worked for packages, but when a food delivery came, the person left it at the door, resulting in cold food. The author's husband thinks they asked for it, but the author feels common sense should have been used.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the communication attempts and the sign's effectiveness. The author's intention was to prevent knocks, which were a problem. The food delivery should have required a knock, but the deliverer followed the sign's instruction too literally. The sign mentions \"Leave packages here,\" which might not apply to food. The deliverer's action led to a problem, but was the author's sign the issue?\n\nThe author's sign was specific to packages, but maybe the deliverer misinterpreted it. However, the sign had courier logos, so maybe it was intended for all deliveries. The question is whether the author's sign was reasonable. The deliverer's job is to ensure the food is delivered properly, so knocking is part of the service. The author expected the deliverer to use common sense, but the deliverer followed the sign strictly. \n\nIs the author at fault? They tried to communicate clearly, but the sign's message might have been too broad. However, the deliverer should have checked if the food needed to be handed over, not just left. So maybe the author isn't the one in the wrong because they communicated their needs, and the deliverer failed to use judgment. The husband's reaction is harsh. The answer might be B (No).\n"
