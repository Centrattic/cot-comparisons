I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a new mom who's dealing with a lot of packages. She's put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" because she doesn't want the delivery people to knock on her door. She's tried multiple times to specify this in the delivery notes, but it didn't work. Then she found a sign with the courier logos, which did work\u2014delivery people stopped knocking. But when they ordered dinner, the delivery person just left it at the door, and it got cold. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of delivery services. Most delivery companies, like Amazon, DoorDash, etc., have standard procedures. If there are no special instructions, the default is usually to knock or ring the doorbell. The author tried to specify \"Do not knock,\" but that's not the standard. So maybe the delivery people were just following their usual process unless told otherwise. However, when the author used the sign with the logos, it worked for packages. That suggests that the delivery people were following the sign's instructions, which might have been more effective than the written notes in the delivery notes.\n\nThen, when ordering dinner, the delivery person saw the sign and didn't knock, leaving the food outside. The problem here is that for food deliveries, the default is usually to knock or ring because you need the recipient to answer to receive it. Leaving food at the door could lead to it getting cold or stolen. The author didn't specify \"no knock\" for this particular delivery, but the sign was visible. The delivery person might have assumed the same rules applied as for packages. However, maybe the sign was intended for packages, not food delivery. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author make her preferences clear enough? She did use the sign, which worked for packages. But maybe food delivery services have different expectations. Also, the delivery person might not have considered that the sign was only for packages. The author might have assumed the sign applied to all deliveries, but the delivery person might have misinterpreted it. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not specifying the sign applies only to packages? Or is the delivery person wrong for not following common sense, like knowing that food needs to be handed over to avoid getting cold? The author's husband thinks they asked for it, implying that the sign caused the problem. But the author thinks common sense should have prevailed. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person followed the sign's instructions, which said not to knock. But maybe they should have used judgment instead of strictly following the sign. However, delivery instructions are usually taken literally. If the customer says \"no knock,\" they follow it. The author might have been too strict, not considering that food deliveries require a different approach. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not making an exception for food deliveries or not specifying that the sign doesn't apply to them. Alternatively, the delivery person should have used their discretion. It's a bit of a gray area. But considering that the author's own sign led to the issue, she might share some responsibility. Therefore, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong), but maybe B (not in the wrong) if considering the sign was meant for packages only. Hmm, tricky. I think the answer is B, but I'm not sure. Wait, the sign had courier logos. If the food delivery is through a different service, maybe the sign didn't apply. The author didn't specify. So the delivery person might not have read the sign correctly. But the author's instructions were clear, even if not specific. So maybe the delivery person is at fault. But the author's sign was the cause. Hmm. I think the answer is B because the delivery person strictly followed the sign, and the author should have considered that different types of deliveries require different handling. So the author is not in the wrong? No, maybe she is. This is confusing. I think the answer is A because she didn't make a special note for food, leading to the problem. So the answer is A.\n"
