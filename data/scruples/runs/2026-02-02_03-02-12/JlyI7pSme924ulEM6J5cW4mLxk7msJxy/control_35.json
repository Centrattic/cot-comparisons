I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the original poster (OP) is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door after they had signs saying \"Do not knock\" for packages. The situation is that OP, a new mom, wanted deliveries to be left at the door to avoid disturbing her baby. She had multiple signs and notes in delivery options, but those were ignored. Then she used a new sign with company logos, which worked for packages but caused a problem with a food delivery that was left outside and got cold.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if OP's actions were reasonable. She had a valid reason: caring for a newborn. Leaving packages at the door is common for people who don't want to be disturbed. The problem arose when she used a sign that also applied to food delivery, which she didn't intend. The food delivery person followed the sign strictly, leading to the food being left out and getting cold. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. OP's signs were for packages, not food deliveries. But the new sign didn't specify.\n2. She had communicated \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes, which were ignored before.\n3. The food delivery person followed the sign literally, causing the issue.\n\nIs OP in the wrong? Well, she didn't explicitly state that the sign applied to food orders. Maybe she should have specified which services the sign applies to. However, she had a legitimate need to avoid disturbances. The delivery person might not have known the sign wasn't for food deliveries. On the other hand, expecting someone to use common sense to distinguish between package and food deliveries might be unfair. The delivery person might not have considered that the sign was only for packages. \n\nBut the OP's husband said they were asking for it, implying that their own signs caused the problem. The question is whether OP overstepped by using a sign that inadvertently affected food deliveries. Since the sign was effective for packages, maybe she should have used a different sign for food. Alternatively, maybe the delivery person should have used judgment instead of strictly following the sign. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, OP tried to communicate her needs but the method might have been unclear. The delivery person followed instructions they thought were given, but the result was unintended. It's a bit ambiguous. However, since the sign was meant for packages and not food orders, perhaps the delivery person should have knocked anyway for time-sensitive food. But the sign didn't specify, so the delivery person might not be at fault either. \n\nI think the main issue is that OP's sign was too broad and didn't differentiate between package and food deliveries. She might be partially at fault for not clarifying. However, her intention was to avoid disturbances for her baby, which is understandable. The delivery person's strict adherence to the sign without considering context led to the problem. It's a bit of a shared responsibility, but the question is whether OP is in the wrong. Since she didn't intend to affect food deliveries and tried to communicate her needs through various means, maybe she's not entirely at fault. However, the sign's lack of specificity could be seen as her oversight. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because her intention was valid, and the delivery person should have used common sense. But others might argue that she should have been more specific. The community on AITA often considers intentions and context. Since her signs were for packages and she tried to mention \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes, but they were ignored, the sign was the only effective method. The food delivery issue was an unintended consequence. So maybe she's not in the wrong because the problem was the delivery person's strict interpretation, not her intention. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
