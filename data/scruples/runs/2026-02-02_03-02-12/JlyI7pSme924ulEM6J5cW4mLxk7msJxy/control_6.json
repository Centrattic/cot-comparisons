I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about signs they put up to tell delivery people not to knock, but when they did get a food delivery, the person left the food at the door and it got cold. The author is upset because the food was late and cold, and their husband said they were asking for it. The author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a new mom with lots of packages. They tried multiple ways to tell delivery people not to knock\u2014handwritten signs and notes in delivery options. The signs worked for packages, but when they ordered food, the delivery person left it at the door instead of knocking. The food was ice cold. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to prevent knockers for packages, but food delivery is different. The sign might have been interpreted as a general \"do not knock\" for all deliveries, including food. However, food delivery often requires immediate attention to keep it warm. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but that led to a problem. \n\nThe author's husband's comment suggests that putting up such signs was asking for trouble, implying that the author is responsible. The author argues that common sense should have made the delivery person knock despite the sign if they noticed it was food. \n\nNow, considering the rules of the service. Most delivery services expect that for food, the delivery should be made to the customer if possible. Leaving food at the door without supervision might not be acceptable because it can get cold. However, if the sign was there, the delivery person might have been following the instructions, assuming that the customer is not home. \n\nBut the sign was specific to packages, but the author used a sign with corporate logos. The example link isn't accessible, but the description says it worked \"too well.\" So maybe the sign was more visible and the delivery person followed it to the letter, not considering the nature of the delivery. \n\nThe author's actions might have caused the problem because the sign was not specific enough. If the sign was meant for packages, but it applied to all deliveries, then the delivery person might have followed it for food as well. The author didn't specify that it's for packages only, leading to the issue.\n\nBut wait, the author did mention \"Do not knock\" in various iterations, and the food delivery is a different type of service. The delivery person might have assumed that the same instruction applies to all deliveries. However, common practice for food delivery is usually to knock or call to ensure it's delivered warm. \n\nSo, the conflict is between the customer's instruction not to knock and the need for food to be delivered hot. If the customer's instructions were followed, but led to a problem, who is at fault? The customer didn't specify that the instruction was only for packages. The delivery person followed the given instruction, but maybe the instruction was too vague. \n\nIn this case, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to prevent knocks for packages. However, the food delivery is a separate service where knocking is expected. The author didn't make the distinction in their sign. The delivery person might be in a dilemma: follow the customer's instruction or ensure the food is delivered properly. Since the food was left at the door and got cold, the delivery person might have misapplied the instruction. \n\nBut the author's husband says they were asking for it. Maybe the author is partially at fault for not clarifying that the instruction was for packages only. However, the delivery person should have exercised common sense to realize that food needs to be handed over. So, the responsibility is split. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sign was ambiguous, leading the delivery person to apply the instruction to all deliveries, then the author might be partially at fault for not being specific. However, the delivery person should also use judgment based on the type of delivery. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. They had a valid reason to avoid knocks for packages, especially as a new mom. But the sign's wording might have been too broad. Alternatively, the delivery person's strict adherence to the sign without considering the food's condition is also a factor. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the sign was intended for packages, and the delivery person misapplied it. The delivery person should have used common sense. The author's instruction was for a specific type of delivery, and the food delivery is different. The main issue is the delivery person following the instruction without considering the context.\n"
