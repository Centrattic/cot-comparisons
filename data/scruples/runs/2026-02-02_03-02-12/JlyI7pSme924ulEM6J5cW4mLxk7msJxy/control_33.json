I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom, which probably means she's dealing with a lot of stress and has limited energy. She gets a lot of packages, so she's used to deliveries. She tried putting signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in different places, but they were ignored. So she created a sign with the courier logos, which worked in that people stopped knocking. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person just left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nThe author is upset because she had to wait 45 minutes for her food, which turned out to be ice cold. Her husband says they asked for it, implying that using the sign was their own fault. She thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: she put up signs to prevent people from knocking, which worked for packages, but then had an issue when someone used the same sign for a food delivery. The food needed to be handed over, not left at the door.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she set up the sign to avoid knocking for packages, but maybe she didn't consider that food delivery might require a different handling. The sign was generic with courier logos, so maybe the food delivery person didn't realize it was for packages only. She might be assuming that the same rule applies to all deliveries, but food is different. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was not to knock, hence leaving it at the door. So maybe the author didn't account for the fact that some deliveries, like food, need to be handed over. \n\nBut she's a new mom, so she might have valid reasons for not wanting to be disturbed. However, maybe the sign was too broad. The problem is that she didn't specify that the sign was only for packages, not food. So perhaps she is at fault for not being clear. On the other hand, the delivery person could have used their judgment, but she argues that common sense should have prevailed.\n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the sign was too ambiguous. If the sign didn't specify it was only for packages, then she might be in the wrong for not clarifying. The delivery person followed the instructions given, which led to the problem. So maybe the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong because the sign was too broad and didn't account for different types of deliveries.\n"
