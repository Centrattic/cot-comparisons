I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a new mom who had signs saying not to knock, which delivery people ignored. So she made a sign with the courier logos, and it worked. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door, it got cold. Her husband says they asked for it, but she thinks common sense should prevail.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The author was trying to prevent deliveries from being left at the door because she's a new mom, maybe with a baby inside. She had clear instructions, but people kept knocking. So she made a more effective sign with the logos, which the delivery person followed. However, in the case of dinner, the delivery was left outside and got cold. \n\nIs she at fault? The key points are: she provided clear instructions, the delivery person followed them, leading to an unintended consequence. The user is upset because the food was cold, but the delivery person followed the instructions. The author might argue that the instruction was to not knock, not to leave the package. But the sign might have been interpreted as \"leave it at the door without knocking.\" \n\nBut maybe the sign was a bit ambiguous. The delivery person might have thought that since the sign said not to knock, they should leave it without waiting, even if it's cold. However, the original intention was probably to prevent knocking, not to skip the knock entirely. The delivery person's action, while following the letter of the instructions, didn't consider the context of food delivery, which requires prompt handling. \n\nThe husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" implies that the author's solution backfired. But the author's main issue was the knocking, which could be disruptive. She might not have anticipated that following the sign would lead to the food getting cold. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the delivery person followed the instructions as given. The author's instructions were to not knock, which is a separate action from how to handle the delivery. So the delivery person might not be at fault. However, the author's signs might have been too vague. Maybe she should have specified \"leave at the door but only if someone is available to take it\" or something. \n\nBut the original problem was that people kept knocking despite instructions. So she made a sign that worked, but now has a new problem. The author's intention was to avoid the noise, but the delivery person handled it in a way that caused another issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely at fault because the instructions were clear on not knocking, but perhaps she didn't consider the different scenarios (like food delivery needing immediate attention). However, the delivery person followed the instructions literally. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether the author's instructions were sufficient. Since she specified \"Do not knock,\" but didn't specify handling for different types of deliveries, maybe the delivery person acted correctly. So the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
