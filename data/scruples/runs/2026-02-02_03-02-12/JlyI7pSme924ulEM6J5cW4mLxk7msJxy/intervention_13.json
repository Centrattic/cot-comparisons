I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to not knock. So, the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages and had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but they were ignored. Then they got a sign with courier logos that worked, but when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door and it was cold. The author is upset because the food was late and cold, but they had the sign up.\n\nHmm. So the author's intention was to prevent the delivery person from knocking, probably because they don't want to be disturbed, maybe with the baby. But the sign was so effective that even when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door. The problem here is that for food, you usually expect the person to knock because you need to answer the door to get it hot. Packages can be left at the door, but food is different. So maybe the author's sign was too generic, not specifying exceptions for food. \n\nThe author wrote \"Do not knock\" in delivery notes and had signs, but maybe they should have made an exception for food deliveries. The delivery person followed the sign literally, but common sense might say that food needs to be handed over immediately. The husband says they were asking for it, which makes sense because the sign didn't differentiate between packages and food. The author thinks common sense should have been used, but the delivery person might have just followed the instructions without considering the context. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They wanted their instructions followed, but maybe they didn't consider that food deliveries require knocking. They might have been too rigid with the sign. But the delivery person also should use some judgment. However, the question is about the author's responsibility. They set the rule, but didn't account for exceptions. So maybe they're somewhat in the wrong for not being specific, but maybe not entirely. It's a bit of a gray area. But the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the consensus here might lean towards B because the author had valid reasons and didn't intend for food to be left, but maybe the sign was unclear. But the delivery person should have used common sense. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the author is at fault because they didn't adjust their sign for different types of deliveries. It's tricky.\n"
