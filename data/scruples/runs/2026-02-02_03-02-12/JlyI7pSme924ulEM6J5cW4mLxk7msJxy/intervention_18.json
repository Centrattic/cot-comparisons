I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a new mom who had previous issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions not to. She put up signs and notes, but they were ignored. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked in that the delivery person didn't knock, but they left the food at the door, which got cold. The husband thinks they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have been used.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The author's main issue is that previous deliveries knocked despite her clear instructions. She took steps to prevent this by using signs and notes. The sign worked in that the delivery person didn't knock, but they left the food at the door, leading to it being cold. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to not knock, but perhaps the sign also implied something else.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the knocking, but maybe the sign's message was too strong. The sign shows courier logos with a \"Do Not Knock\" message and a line through a doorbell. It might have been interpreted as \"Don't bother me at all,\" leading the delivery person to leave it at the door even if it wasn't a package. The food delivery was a service that required the person to be present to receive it, so leaving it at the door without confirmation might not be appropriate. However, the author's signs were about not knocking, so the delivery person might have thought leaving it there was the only option since they couldn't knock.\n\nThe husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he believes the sign's message was too absolute. The author argues common sense should have been used, meaning the delivery person should have followed protocol for food delivery regardless of the sign. But if the delivery person couldn't knock due to the sign, maybe they should have called or found another way to confirm. However, sometimes food deliveries do require someone to be present, so leaving it at the door might not be standard practice.\n\nI need to consider if the author's expectations are reasonable. She wanted to avoid the noise and disruption of knocking, especially as a new mom. The sign was effective in stopping the knocking, but perhaps it didn't account for situations where interaction is necessary, like food delivery. The delivery person might have misinterpreted the sign's instructions, thinking they shouldn't make any contact at all. However, the sign's message is clear: no knocking. If the delivery person can't knock, they might not know how to proceed, leading to leaving the food at the door without confirmation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She made her request clear, and the delivery person followed the instructions literally, which caused a problem. But maybe the author should have considered that food delivery requires someone to be present. However, the sign doesn't specify exceptions. It's a bit of a conflict between her need for quiet and the delivery's need for interaction. The answer hinges on whether her instructions were too absolute without considering different types of deliveries. If the sign's message is \"Do Not Knock,\" perhaps the delivery person should have used an alternative method (like calling the doorbell or leaving a note), but the sign says not to knock, which might include using the doorbell. The sign has a line through the doorbell icon, implying not to use it. So the delivery person couldn't use any door contact method, leading to leaving it at the door without confirmation.\n\nIn that case, the author's instructions were clear, but maybe she didn't account for the necessity of interaction in food deliveries. However, she's a new mom who might need to avoid disturbances. The delivery person should have found a way to confirm the delivery without knocking, but if they couldn't, they might have to proceed as they did. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting clear expectations, but maybe she needs to adjust the sign for different types of deliveries. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong now. Given that she followed protocol and the delivery person followed the instructions, leading to an unintended consequence, it's possible she's not in the wrong. The issue is a miscommunication, but the fault isn't entirely hers. The delivery person might have been too literal, but the author's instructions were explicit. So, answer B for No.\n"
