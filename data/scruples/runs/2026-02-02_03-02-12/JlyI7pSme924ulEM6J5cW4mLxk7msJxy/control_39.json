I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's been putting up signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" because she probably wants to avoid the hassle of answering the door, maybe because she's busy with the baby. But the delivery people kept knocking anyway. So she created a more noticeable sign with the courier logos, which worked for packages\u2014no more knocking. But then when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are: she tried multiple times to communicate her preference not to be knocked on, which worked for packages, but food delivery is different. Food needs to be delivered hot, so knocking to confirm receipt makes sense. By using the same sign for food delivery, maybe she didn't consider that the rules for packages and food might differ. The delivery person followed her instruction literally, leading to a cold meal.\n\nSo, is she at fault? She tried to prevent being disturbed by packages, which is understandable, but food delivery requires a different approach. The sign might have been meant for packages, not food. Maybe she should have specified that the sign was only for package deliveries. Her husband's comment suggests they might have set up the sign without considering the different needs for food. However, the delivery person didn't ask if it was a food order, just followed the sign. The situation is a bit of a mix-up. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she was trying to manage her deliveries, but maybe there's a nuance. Alternatively, she might be partially at fault for not differentiating between package and food deliveries. Hmm.\n"
