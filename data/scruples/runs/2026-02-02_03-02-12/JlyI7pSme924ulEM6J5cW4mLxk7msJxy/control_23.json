I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a new mom, has a sign saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages. They had handwritten signs and notes in the checkout, but people kept knocking anyway. Then they found a more prominent sign with logos, which worked, but now when a food delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, it was cold, and the user is upset. The husband says they were asking for it, but the user thinks common sense should have applied.\n\nFirst, the main points: The user wanted packages left without knocking, so they put up signs. The food delivery person followed the sign's instruction, left the food at the door, but the user didn't realize it right away, leading to cold food. The user is now upset about the result but is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the user is at fault for expecting that the sign would apply to food deliveries as well as packages. The sign was intended for packages, but maybe the user didn't specify that it's only for packages. The sign they used had corporate logos, which might make it clear it's for package deliveries, not food. But maybe the delivery person didn't realize the difference. The user might have assumed the sign applied to all deliveries, but the food delivery person took it literally and followed the instruction, leading to the problem. \n\nBut then, the user is upset that the food was left outside and got cold. The husband says they were asking for it, implying that if they wanted food deliveries to be brought in, they shouldn't have put the sign. However, the user's intention was to stop people from knocking for packages, not food. So maybe the user didn't communicate clearly enough that the sign was only for packages, not food. Alternatively, the delivery person could have used judgment to knock for food but not for packages, but the user's sign might have been too broad. \n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the sign was misinterpreted. If the sign was meant for packages only, but the food delivery person applied it to food, then the user might not be in the wrong because the sign's message was too vague. However, if the user should have known that the sign might affect food deliveries and didn't clarify, then maybe they share some responsibility. \n\nBut the user's main issue is that the delivery person followed the sign to the letter, leading to a problem. The user's intention was to avoid interruptions for packages, which is reasonable. However, food deliveries might require a different approach. The user might not be in the wrong because they were trying to prevent unnecessary knocks for packages, but perhaps they should have had a separate instruction for food. \n\nIn the end, the user is expecting the delivery person to use common sense, which the delivery person didn't do. So maybe the user isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
