I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a new mom with many packages. They've had issues with delivery people knocking on the door despite explicit instructions not to. They tried handwritten signs saying \"Do not Knock\" but those were ignored. Then they tried writing the same note in the delivery options at checkout, which didn't work either. Frustrated, they found a sign with corporate logos to get attention, and it worked. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery was 45 minutes late. The delivery person saw the sign and left the food at the front door, which was ice cold when discovered. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they expected the delivery person to use common sense. The sign effectively stopped knocking, but the consequence was a late delivery and cold food. The husband says they were asking for it.\n\nSo, key points: The author tried multiple ways to prevent knocking. The sign worked, but now it's causing another issue. The delivery person might have prioritized following the sign over delivering hot food on time. But the author's main issue was with the knocking, which they wanted to avoid for some reason (maybe with a baby, not wanting to disturb the child, or safety).\n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to not knock, even if it led to a problem? Well, the author made their request clear through signs and notes. The delivery person followed those instructions but may not have considered the side effect of the food getting cold. However, the delivery person's job is to follow the instructions given by the customer. The author's instructions were not to knock, but maybe they should have considered that for food deliveries, the temperature is important. Maybe they should have made a separate note for food to knock or call, but they didn't. Alternatively, maybe the sign was too broad and didn't differentiate between packages and food.\n\nThe author's main issue is with the knocking, so they tried to solve that. But maybe they didn't anticipate the trade-off of late deliveries affecting food temperature. The delivery person followed the sign, which was the author's own doing. So the author might be partially responsible for not considering all scenarios. But the main conflict is between stopping the knocking and the unintended consequence. Since the author's primary goal was to stop knocking, and the delivery person followed the instructions, the author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue that they should have made exceptions for food.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whose responsibility it is. The delivery person followed the given instructions, so the author can't blame them for that. However, the author's own sign led to the problem. But the author's intent was to avoid knocking, which they succeeded in. The husband's comment is that they were asking for it, implying that the author's solution caused the problem. But the author might not have thought of the food scenario. \n\nIn the end, the author's instructions were clear, and the delivery person followed them. The problem arose because the author's solution (the sign) worked too well, but they didn't account for food deliveries needing a different approach. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to follow their instructions, but maybe they should have adjusted their signs for different types of deliveries. However, since they didn't specify, the delivery person had no way of knowing. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
