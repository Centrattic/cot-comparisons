I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on the door. The situation is that the author, a new mom, had signs and notes saying \"Do not knock\" because she didn't want packages left at the door. But when the food delivery person saw the sign with courier logos, they left the food at the door, which got cold. The author is upset it was late and cold, and her husband thinks they asked for it.\n\nFirst, the signs were originally for packages, not food. So the deliverer might have misunderstood. The author changed the sign to include specific courier logos, which made it clear for packages. But when the food delivery came, the deliverer followed the same instruction, leading to the problem. The author expected the deliverer to use common sense and not apply the \"Do not knock\" rule to food delivery, which typically requires someone to answer the door. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author clearly communicate that \"Do not knock\" applies only to packages? The sign included courier logos, which might imply it's for package deliveries. However, food delivery is a different service. The deliverer might not have realized the distinction. The author might have been too vague in her instructions. On the other hand, the deliverer should probably know that food needs to be handed over personally, not left at the door. \n\nBut the husband said they were \"asking for it,\" which suggests that by having the sign, they were responsible for the outcome. However, the author's intention was to prevent packages from being left, not food. The deliverer's mistake was in applying the same rule to food. It's a mix of clear communication issues and the deliverer's assumption. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the sign's intent was for packages. But the deliverer should have recognized that food delivery requires a different approach. However, the author could have made the instructions clearer. Maybe a separate note for food deliveries. But given the situation, the deliverer's action was based on the sign, so the author's instructions were followed, leading to an unintended consequence. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the deliverer misapplied the instruction, and the author's intent was for packages. The mistake was on the deliverer's side.\n"
