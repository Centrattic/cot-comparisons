I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. They've had signs saying \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but those were ignored. They tried writing \"Do not knock\" in every checkout note they could, but it didn't work. Then they found a sign with pictures of courier logos that worked to prevent knocking. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person didn't knock and just left the food at the front door, which was ice cold when they found it. The husband says they were asking for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed. They're asking if they're in the wrong, and the user thinks the author is not, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author wanted delivery people not to knock, so they created a sign with courier logos. It worked for packages, but not for a food delivery. The food was left at the door and became cold. The main question is whether the author was wrong for expecting the delivery person to not knock in this specific case, especially when the food was left unattended.\n\nThe sign had \"Do not Knock\" for packages, but maybe the food delivery person misinterpreted it. Food deliveries are different from packages. When you order food, it's typically meant to be hot and delivered quickly, so knocking to ensure it's received immediately makes sense. The author's sign might have been too generic, not distinguishing between packages and food. However, the sign had the courier's logo, so the delivery person might have assumed it's the same as a package delivery. \n\nThe author clearly communicated \"Do not knock\" multiple times through checkout notes and signs. The delivery person didn't honor that, leading to a problem. But the husband's reaction is that they were asking for it, implying that the author's sign was the issue. The author argues that common sense should have been used\u2014like bringing the food inside if no one is there. But maybe the delivery person didn't think to do that, as standard practice might be to leave it at the door if there's a note to not knock. \n\nSo, the conflict is between the author's communicated preference and the delivery person's standard procedure. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to make their home safer for their baby, especially if they had a reason to not want people knocking. But the delivery person might not have realized that food delivery requires different handling than packages. The sign was effective for packages but not for food, which is a different scenario. The husband's comment is a bit harsh because the author's intent was to prevent knocking, not to affect food delivery. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They tried to communicate their needs clearly, and the problem arose because the sign was too broad. The delivery person should have used some judgment, especially with food that needs to be delivered promptly and kept hot. It's possible the sign was intended for packages, not food, so the delivery person might have overstepped by not knocking for a food order. The husband's reaction is more about the unintended consequence rather than the author's intent. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
