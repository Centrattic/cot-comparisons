I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who's had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite clear instructions not to. She used signs and notes, but they were ignored. Then she made a sign with corporate logos to get attention, which worked but caused a problem when the food delivery left the package at the door, making it cold.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. The key points are her intent versus the outcome. She was trying to prevent delivery people from knocking, which she had a reason for, maybe to avoid disturbing her baby or being busy. She used various methods, but the sign with logos was effective. However, when a food delivery person left the food outside, it was cold and ruined. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to use common sense despite the sign.\n\nOn one hand, she clearly communicated her instructions not to knock. The delivery person saw the sign and followed it, but didn't check if the package needed to be left outside. The sign might have been too strict for food deliveries, which require prompt handling. The author might not have considered that some deliveries, like food, need special handling. But the delivery person should have used judgment. Maybe the sign was too absolute, not accounting for perishable items.\n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person's job is to follow the customer's instructions, but also to ensure the delivery is done properly. If the customer said not to knock, but the delivery requires immediate attention, the delivery person should have found another way, like calling the customer or leaving a note. The author might not be in the wrong because she communicated her preferences, but the delivery person should have exercised better judgment. However, the sign's effectiveness in preventing knocks might have backfired in this specific case. So, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether the author should have anticipated the need for different handling for food, or if the delivery person should have used their own common sense beyond the sign's instructions.\n"
