I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the food deliverer to knock on their door. The author is a new mom who had previous issues with delivery people not following the \"Do not knock\" instructions. She put up a sign with pictures of courier logos to ensure deliveries were left at the door. However, when they ordered dinner, the delivery person left the food at the door without knocking, resulting in a cold meal and the food being late.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a new mom, which might mean she has specific needs, like needing to be asleep with a baby. She tried various methods to communicate \"Do not knock,\" even through delivery notes, but it didn't work. Then she used a sign with courier logos, which effectively made delivery people leave packages at the door. The problem arose when the sign was applied to a food delivery, which the courier followed to the letter, causing the food to be left outside and get cold.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the intent. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she achieved. However, the sign didn't specify that it applies to all deliveries, including food. The courier followed the sign's instruction without question, leading to an unintended consequence. The author might not have considered that food deliveries might require a different handling, like a knock to alert someone. The husband's comment that they were asking for it suggests he thinks they should have been more specific.\n\nFrom a standpoint of responsibility, the author tried multiple ways to communicate her preference but didn't account for the different nature of food delivery. The courier acted on the sign as written, so the issue might lie in the sign's wording or clarity. The author might not be entirely at fault, but there's room for improvement in her approach. However, the courier's strict adherence without exception could also be questioned. \n\nIn terms of common sense, the delivery person could have used judgment to knock for a food delivery, even if the sign said \"Do not knock.\" But the sign's presence might have been interpreted as an absolute rule. The author's frustration is understandable given the cold food and the delay. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to follow the sign but not foreseeing the food delivery scenario. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. The courier followed the instructions as given, and the sign's ambiguity (not specifying that it only applies to non-food deliveries) led to the problem. The author's intent was to prevent knocking, which she successfully did, but the outcome was an unintended consequence. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
