I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a new mom who had issues with delivery people knocking on her door despite her clear instructions. She put up signs saying \"Do not knock\" and also noted it in delivery options. When that didn't work, she used a sign with corporate logos, which worked for packages but then caused a problem with food delivery. The food was left at the door, got cold, and the delivery person didn't knock. The husband says they asked for it, but the author thinks common sense should have prevailed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author tried multiple times to communicate her preference not to be knocked on, probably to avoid disturbing her baby. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction literally, which was effective for packages but not for food, which requires prompt delivery. The conflict arises because the sign's instruction led to a negative outcome for the food delivery. \n\nNow, considering the question of wrongdoing. The author's intention was to prevent knocking, which she had a right to, especially as a new mom needing a quiet environment. However, the sign might have been too broad, not distinguishing between package deliveries and food. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, which was to not knock, hence leaving the food at the door. But food delivery often requires immediate handover to maintain temperature, so maybe the sign's instructions were too rigid for that context. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she did communicate her instructions clearly as per her needs. However, maybe she didn't consider that food delivery might require different handling. But she wasn't wrong to set boundaries. The delivery person might have had common sense to realize that leaving food outside could ruin it, but the sign said not to knock. So the delivery person followed the written instruction literally. \n\nThe husband's comment that they asked for it is a bit harsh. The author did ask not to knock, but perhaps the sign's design (with corporate logos) was too strict. The key is whether the author's instructions were reasonable. Since she had a valid reason (new mom, baby's sleep), maybe she's not in the wrong. The delivery person might have been at fault for not using judgment, but the question is about the author. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). She tried to communicate her needs clearly and had a valid reason. The problem was the sign's broad application not accounting for food delivery specifics, but that's more on the delivery person or the system not having a better way to differentiate delivery types. The author's intention was reasonable, so she's not the asshole here.\n"
