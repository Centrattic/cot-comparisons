I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting the delivery person to knock. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the author is a new mom who gets a lot of packages. She's been putting up signs that say \"Do not Knock\" and also specified that in delivery notes, but the couriers kept knocking. Then she used a sign with the courier logos, which worked but led to a problem. When they ordered dinner, the delivery person left it at the door without knocking, and it got cold. The author is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the main points. The author wants to avoid being knocked on the door, probably because she's a new mom and doesn't want to be disturbed. She tried multiple times to communicate the \"no knock\" instruction, but it didn't work. So she used a more visible sign with the company logos. The delivery person followed the sign's instruction, but this caused an issue when the food was left outside and got cold. The husband thinks they were asking for it, but the author feels it's a common sense issue.\n\nNow, the key points are about communication and expectations. The author made her preferences clear through signs and notes. The delivery person followed those instructions literally, which led to an unintended consequence. The problem is whether the author is responsible for not considering that the delivery person might not be able to follow the instructions in all situations, like leaving perishable food outside.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a valid reason to avoid being knocked on the door. On the other hand, she might have assumed that the delivery person would use judgment and knock when necessary, like when delivering food that needs to be kept warm. But she explicitly told them not to knock, so maybe the delivery person was just following orders.\n\nIs the author at fault for not realizing that some deliveries require different handling? Or is the delivery person responsible for using common sense even with the instructions given? The author's husband says they were asking for it, implying that maybe they should have considered that the instructions might lead to issues with certain deliveries. However, the author argues that common sense should prevail, meaning the delivery person should have knocked even if told not to, to ensure the food stays hot.\n\nIn such cases, the responsibility might lie with the author for not being specific enough. Maybe she should have differentiated between package deliveries and food deliveries. The signs might have been too general. But she did specify \"do not knock\" in all cases. The delivery person might have followed the instruction without considering the food's perishable nature. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. She made her preferences clear, but perhaps didn't account for situations where not knocking could cause issues. However, the delivery person is also supposed to use judgment. I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she had valid reasons and communicated her needs. The delivery person might have been too rigid in following the instructions. Therefore, the answer is B for No.\n"
