I had handwritten signs that said \"Do not Knock\" for packages in various iterations that were ignored. I always wrote \"Do not knock\" in every checkout cart that offered \"delivery options\" notes. It never worked. So, I found a sign that had pictures of the corporate courier logos for attention. And it worked! Too well... We ordered dinner last night and it was 45 minutes late! UGH. Well... The food delivery person saw the sign and silently left it at the front door. It was ice cold when we realized what happened. Am I the asshole? My husband said we were asking for it. I think common sense should have prevailed.\n\n[The Sign](https://imgur.com/gallery/rIFIXCr)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a new mom who's dealing with a lot of package deliveries. She's put up signs saying \"Do not Knock\" in different ways, but the delivery people keep knocking. Then she finds a sign with corporate logos that worked to stop them from knocking. However, when she orders food, the delivery person follows the sign and leaves it at the door in the cold, causing the food to get cold.\n\nSo, the main conflict here is about whether the author is at fault for expecting the delivery person to follow the sign. The question is if she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's intention was to avoid the noise from knocking, which makes sense, especially for a new mom who might be up all night. She tried multiple methods to communicate \"Do not Knock.\" The sign with logos worked for packages, but the food delivery was different. The delivery person, perhaps seeing the same sign, left the food outside, leading to it being cold. \n\nThe key point is whether the sign's instructions should apply to all deliveries. The author might not have realized that food delivery requires the person to be present to receive it, unlike packages. So, the sign might have been misunderstood or applied too broadly. \n\nOn the other hand, the delivery person might have followed the sign strictly without considering that the food needs to be handed over. The husband's comment that they were \"asking for it\" suggests that using the same sign for food deliveries was problematic. \n\nBut the author's main issue was expecting the delivery person to use common sense, like realizing that food shouldn't be left outside. However, the sign didn't specify exceptions for food, so the delivery person had no way of knowing. The author might be at fault for not clarifying the sign's scope. \n\nAlternatively, the delivery person should have used judgment, but the sign might have been too absolute. The sign's effectiveness for packages shows it works, but not for food. The author's problem is that the solution for one issue created a problem in another context. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's instructions were too broad. If the sign didn't specify that it's only for packages, then maybe she's responsible for the ambiguity. However, the delivery person should have checked if the recipient was present, even if the sign said not to knock. \n\nIn the end, the author's main wrong is expecting the delivery person to follow the same rule for food without making exceptions. Therefore, the answer is A, she is in the wrong.\n"
