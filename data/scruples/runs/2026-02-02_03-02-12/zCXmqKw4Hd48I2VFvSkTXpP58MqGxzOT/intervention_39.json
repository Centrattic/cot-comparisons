He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, then started threatening suicide and harassing the ex. The author told him to stop, called him creepy and pathetic, which led to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior after the breakup is definitely problematic. Threatening self-harm, constant calls, and wanting to confront the ex in person are all red flags. The author and friends tried to support him post-hospital, but when the friend kept pushing, the author snapped.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was justified. The friend needed to stop the behavior, and the author was trying to help. Even though they used harsh words, the intent was to make the friend stop something unhealthy. The friends agreed with the author but thought a nicer approach might have worked. However, in a crisis situation where someone is a danger to themselves or others, directness can be necessary. The author's words were blunt, but they were pointing out the reality of the situation, which the friend wasn't seeing. So the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to prevent further harm. The answer should be B.\n"
