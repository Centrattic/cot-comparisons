He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who's been acting inappropriately after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, leading to the breakup. After the split, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even planning to go to her place. The poster confronted him, told him he's being creepy and pathetic, and was kicked out. Friends agree with the poster's stance but thought maybe the approach could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the behavior of the friend. Threatening self-harm is serious and requires immediate attention. The poster's friend was not just being clingy but was potentially endangering himself, which the friends addressed by calling 911. Then, after the hospital, the friend is still contacting the ex and planning to approach her, which is definitely stalking behavior. The poster's intervention was to tell him he's being creepy and needs to stop. \n\nThe key points are whether the poster overstepped. They did express concern and supported the friend during a crisis, then finally had the conversation when the friend wasn't receptive. The friend was in a fragile state, so the way the message was delivered matters. However, the content of the message\u2014stopping the harassment\u2014is justified. The poster's intent was to prevent further harm to both the ex and the friend.\n\nPossible arguments against the poster: They might have approached it in a more supportive, less harsh way. Calling someone \"pathetic\" could be seen as harsh, even if the message is right. But considering the friend's actions, the poster's words were meant to be direct to stop dangerous behavior. The friends agree with the message, so the main issue is the delivery, not the content. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the poster isn't in the wrong for conveying the necessary message. They were trying to help a friend in crisis. The main issue is that they could have been more empathetic in their approach, but the intent was good. So the answer is B.\n"
