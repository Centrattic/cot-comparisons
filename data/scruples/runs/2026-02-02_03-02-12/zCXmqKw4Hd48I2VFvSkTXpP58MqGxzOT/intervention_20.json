He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, moving too fast, and then got dumped because he wasn't handling his anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, wanting to go to her place. The author, after trying to help, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop.\n\nThe main question is if the author is at fault. The author's friends agree with them, but maybe they could have been nicer. But the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's threatening self-harm, which is a serious issue. The author called 911, so they were involved in getting help. Then, after hospitalization, the friend is still obsessive, and the author is trying to help him accept the breakup.\n\nThe author's message was direct, but it seems necessary. The ex has clearly said no, so the friend's actions are harassment. The author is trying to prevent further harm to both the friend and the ex. Even though the delivery might have been harsh, the content is valid. The friend kicked the author out, but that's his reaction. The author's intention was to stop harmful behavior, which is justified. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
