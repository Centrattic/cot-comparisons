He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, moving too fast, leading to the breakup. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and planning to confront her. The author steps in, tells him to stop, and gets kicked out but others agree with the author.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Threatening self-harm and stalking behavior are serious red flags. The author is trying to help their friend by calling out harmful actions, which might be harsh but necessary. The friends also agree, suggesting that the author's approach, while maybe not the most diplomatic, was justified.\n\nThe question is about right or wrong. The author is pointing out their friend's problematic behavior, which is actually supporting the ex's boundaries. Even if the delivery could have been softer, the intent is to prevent further harm. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
