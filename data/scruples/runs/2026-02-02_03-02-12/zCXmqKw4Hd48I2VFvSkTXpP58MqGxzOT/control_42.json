He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, and wanting to confront her. The author stepped in and told him to stop, calling him creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but thought it could have been said nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is trying to help their friend by pointing out harmful behavior. The friend is in a vulnerable state, but the author's message is valid\u2014stalking, threatening self-harm, and persistent harassment are serious issues. The question is whether the author overstepped by using harsh language (\"creepy and pathetic\") even if the message was correct.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention was to prevent further harm. The friend's actions are definitely concerning and need to be addressed. However, the author's approach was blunt. While the message was necessary, the delivery could have been more compassionate. But does that make the author in the wrong? The user is asking if the author is at fault for the content of the message, not the delivery. \n\nThe friend's behavior crosses into stalking and potential harassment, which is not okay. The author is right to point out the need to stop this behavior. Even if the words were harsh, the core message was correct. So the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up. However, maybe they could have been kinder. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for addressing the harmful behavior, even if their tone was harsh. The friend needed to hear that their actions were unacceptable. The author's actions were justified in preventing further issues.\n"
