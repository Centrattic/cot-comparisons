He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's being really obsessive and threatening after a breakup, and the author confronts him, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling 911, threatening self-harm, constant calls, and wanting to confront the ex. The author, after trying to help, finally tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, which causes the friend to kick them out. The author's friends agree with them but think a nicer approach might have been better.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author at fault for confronting their friend about his behavior?\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if confronting someone about harmful behavior is wrong. The friend's actions are clearly unhealthy\u2014stalking, threatening self-harm, harassment. The author's friends back them up, so maybe they're not being mean without cause. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) might be due to his own emotional state.\n\nBut maybe the author could have been more diplomatic. However, the behavior being addressed is objectively problematic. The author isn't just being harsh; they're pointing out genuine issues. The friend's actions are dangerous and need to be addressed. So, the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up, even if the delivery was harsh. The alternative is staying silent and not helping their friend. The author's intention was to help, so B (not in the wrong) seems correct.\n"
