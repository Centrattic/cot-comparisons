He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic is in the wrong. The friend just went through a breakup, and the friend's behavior after the breakup is concerning. \n\nFirst, the ex was moving too fast in the relationship, which led to the breakup. The friend is now acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, and wanting to confront her. This is definitely unhealthy behavior. The author steps in, tells their friend he's being creepy and pathetic, and the friend kicks them out. The author's friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's actions are inappropriate and potentially harmful. The author is trying to intervene to protect the ex and their friend. The author's message is harsh but truthful. The friends agree with the sentiment but suggest a softer approach.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The friend's behavior is unhealthily obsessive. The author is correct to point that out. However, the way they delivered it was harsh. But given the situation, was the content of the message wrong? The friend needs to stop contacting the ex, and the author is emphasizing that. The author isn't in the wrong for the message's content, though maybe the delivery could be improved. So the answer is B (No).\n"
