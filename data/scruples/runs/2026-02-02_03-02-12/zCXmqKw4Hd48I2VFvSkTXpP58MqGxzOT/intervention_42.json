He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who's acting out after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months and was moving too fast, which led to the breakup. The friend then starts threatening self-harm, calls the ex repeatedly, and even mentions going to her place. The author steps in, tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, and the friend gets angry and kicks them out.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's showing signs of stalking, threatening self-harm, and not respecting the ex's decision. The author is trying to intervene to stop this harmful behavior. Friends agree with the author's sentiment but think the approach could have been nicer. \n\nBut considering the urgency of the situation\u2014threats of self-harm and harassment\u2014it's possible the author was right to speak up, even if the method wasn't the kindest. The friend's actions are concerning, and the author might be trying to prevent further harm. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
