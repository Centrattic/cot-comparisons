He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend \"creepy and pathetic\" after a breakup. The friend was acting out, making threatening calls, and trying to get back together. The author intervened, which led to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The friend's behavior sounds really concerning. Threatening self-harm, stalking, and not respecting the ex's decision are all red flags. The author's friends agree with them, so there's some social validation there. But the author's approach was direct and maybe harsh, using strong language.\n\nIn situations like this, the priority is usually to prevent harm to the friend. The ex is clearly done, and the friend's actions could escalate into something dangerous. The author stepping in to stop this behavior, even if the delivery was rough, seems justified. However, the method could have been more constructive. Instead of calling the friend \"pathetic,\" maybe offering support while setting boundaries.\n\nBut considering the context\u2014the friend was at the hospital, and the author was part of the support group\u2014their frustration is understandable. The friends agree with the sentiment, just not the delivery. So the author's intentions were good, but the execution could have been smoother. Still, the main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's reaction. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help, even if the wording was harsh. So, the answer is B.\n"
