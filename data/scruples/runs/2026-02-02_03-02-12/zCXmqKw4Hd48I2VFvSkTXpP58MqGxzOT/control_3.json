He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who was in a relationship that ended due to moving too fast. After the breakup, the friend is acting out, calling the ex and threatening self-harm, and showing obsessive behavior like wanting to visit her place. The author intervened, told their friend off, and got kicked out. The friends agree with the author but think a nicer approach could have worked.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The friend's actions\u2014continuously contacting the ex, threatening self-harm, and planning to go to her place\u2014are clearly unhealthy and potentially harmful. The author stepping in to stop this behavior seems justified. However, the method of confrontation might be a point of debate. The author was direct and called their friend \"creepy and pathetic,\" which could be harsh. But given the context, the friend's actions are concerning and need to be addressed. The key here is that the author is trying to prevent further harm, both to the friend and the ex. While the approach could have been more compassionate, the intent is good, and the friends support the author. The main issue is the content of the message, not the delivery. So the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to help, even if the tone could have been better. The answer is B.\n"
