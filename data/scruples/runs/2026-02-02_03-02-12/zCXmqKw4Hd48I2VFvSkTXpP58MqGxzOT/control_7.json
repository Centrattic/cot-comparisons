He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast, and post-breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex, wanting to confront her. The author, after trying to help, finally tells him to stop, calling him creepy and pathetic. The friend gets angry and kicks them out.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's stalking or harassing his ex, threatening self-harm, which is a serious red flag. The author and friends are trying to support him but also need to set boundaries. The author's outburst was after multiple failed attempts to reason with him. While the author could have approached it more gently, their intention was to stop harmful behavior. The key here is that the ex doesn't want to get back together, and the friend isn't respecting that. The author's message, though harsh, is valid. The friends agreed with the author, just suggesting a nicer tone. So, the author isn't in the wrong; they were protecting their friend and the ex from further harm. The answer should be B.\n"
