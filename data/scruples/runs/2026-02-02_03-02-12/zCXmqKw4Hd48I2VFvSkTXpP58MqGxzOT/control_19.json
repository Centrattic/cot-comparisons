He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out by threatening suicide and stalking the ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast. After the breakup, he's not handling it well\u2014calling the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, considering showing up uninvited. The writer steps in and tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend gets angry and kicks them out.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Threatening self-harm is a serious issue, and the writer is concerned enough to call 911. Then, the writer confronts the friend about his actions. The question is whether the writer was wrong to do so.\n\nI should consider if the writer's actions were appropriate. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014harassment, potential stalking, and not respecting the ex's boundaries. The writer is trying to help by setting a boundary and telling him to stop. Even though the friend might have felt the message could have been delivered more gently, the content of the message (calling him out on creepy behavior) is valid. \n\nHowever, the tone might be an issue. The user's friends mentioned that a nicer approach could have been better, but they still agree with the message. The main concern is the content, not the delivery. Since the friend's actions are harmful and the writer is trying to prevent further issues, the writer's intentions are good. \n\nIs there any wrong in the writer's action? Well, if the writer wasn't the one responsible for the friend's well-being, maybe, but since they had to call 911 and were involved in supporting him, it's part of their role. Also, the writer is within their rights to set boundaries, especially when someone is acting in a way that's harmful. \n\nBut maybe the writer overstepped by using harsh language like \"creepy and pathetic.\" However, given the context, it's a justified reaction to prevent further harm. The friend's behavior is not okay, and the writer is trying to stop it. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
