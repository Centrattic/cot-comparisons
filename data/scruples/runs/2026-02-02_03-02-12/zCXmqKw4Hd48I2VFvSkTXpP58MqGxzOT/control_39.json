He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, moving too fast, leading to the breakup. Afterward, the friend is acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, wanting to confront her. The writer, along with friends, tried to help, but when the friend kept talking about getting her back, the writer snapped and called him creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked them out, and others agree the message was right but maybe could have been delivered better.\n\nSo, the key points here: the friend's behavior is definitely problematic, even abusive. The writer tried to intervene, which is a good thing. The friend was in a vulnerable state, but the writer's words were harsh. However, the friend's actions were dangerous (self-harm, stalking behavior). The friends agreed with the message, just the delivery could be softer.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the message was valid and necessary despite the harsh delivery. Since the friend was in a mental health crisis, the writer's intervention was important to prevent further harm. The friends agreed, so it's more about the delivery method than the content. The writer isn't wrong for speaking up, even if they could have been nicer. So the answer is B (No).\n"
