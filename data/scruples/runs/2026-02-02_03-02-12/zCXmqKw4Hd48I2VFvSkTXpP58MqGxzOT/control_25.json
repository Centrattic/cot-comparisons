He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who was in a relationship, got dumped, and is now acting out in unhealthy ways.\n\nFirst, the friend was with a girl for 8 months and was overly committed from the start. The breakup happened because he was moving too fast. Then, after the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling her constantly, and talking about confronting her. The author steps in, tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop, and gets kicked out. Friends agree but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nSo the core issue is whether the author's actions were justified. The friend is clearly in a bad state, possibly emotionally unstable. The author is trying to help by calling out harmful behavior. The friend's actions, like threatening self-harm and stalking, are dangerous. The author's response might have been harsh, but the intent was to protect both the ex and the friend.\n\nThe key points: the friend's behavior is problematic and potentially harmful. The author intervened to stop it. While the delivery might have been harsh, the message is necessary. The friends agree, so there's some validation. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help, even if the method could be improved. The friend's actions are the main problem here. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
