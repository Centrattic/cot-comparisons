He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, and even considering showing up at her place. The author confronted him, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic. Harassment, threats, and not respecting the ex's wishes are all red flags. The author intervened by telling him he was being creepy and to stop. The friend got angry and kicked them out.\n\nThe friends think the author could have been nicer but agree with the message. The key here is whether the author was wrong to speak up. The author's actions were meant to help, but the delivery might have been harsh. However, the content of the message is valid. The friend needs to stop his behavior, which is unhealthy and potentially dangerous.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. While the approach could have been more compassionate, the intent was to help. The friend's actions are concerning, and the author has a right to express that. The author isn't responsible for the friend's reaction; the friend's response (getting angry and kicking them out) is on him. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
