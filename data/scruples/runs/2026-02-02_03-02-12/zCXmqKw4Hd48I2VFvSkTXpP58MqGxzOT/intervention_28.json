He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out after the breakup, making threats, and trying to get back with the girl. The author stepped in and confronted him, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was in a bad state, even needing hospitalization after threatening self-harm. But he's still contacting the ex and wanting to confront her, which is definitely problematic. The author's friends agree with them, though they think it could have been handled nicer. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's being obsessive, threatening, and not respecting her decision. The author is trying to help him realize that his actions are wrong. Even if the author could have been more gentle, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might have been harsh. Using words like \"creepy\" and \"pathetic\" could have been hurtful, especially when the friend is already vulnerable. But given the circumstances, the message was necessary. The author's criticism was valid because the friend needed to stop his stalking-like behavior. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author's friends support them suggests that their actions were justified. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's words. So while the method could have been smoother, the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up. The answer should be B.\n"
