He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out by threatening self-harm, contacting the ex, and wanting to confront her. The author confronted him, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm requires immediate attention, and stalking or harassing the ex is wrong. The author's friends agree with their actions, even if they think the approach could have been nicer. \n\nThe author's intent was to stop their friend from doing something harmful. They were trying to help, not be cruel. Even if the delivery was harsh, the message was necessary. The friend was in crisis, but the author had a responsibility to intervene when the behavior was self-destructive and potentially dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more gentle. But the situation was urgent. The friend was in a mental health crisis, and the author might not have the tools to handle it. The alternative is letting the friend continue harmful actions, which isn't good either.\n\nSo, the author was right to speak up. They weren't being cruel without reason; they were trying to prevent further harm. The friend's actions were the real issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
