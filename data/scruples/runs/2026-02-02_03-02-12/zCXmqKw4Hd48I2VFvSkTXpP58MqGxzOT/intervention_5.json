He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm, and trying to get back together with his ex. The author intervened by telling him to stop, which caused a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was in a bad state, had mental health issues (anxiety), and was threatening self-harm. The author and friends were involved in trying to help, even calling 911. The author's actions were in response to the friend's continued inappropriate behavior post-breakup, like following the ex and trying to win her back against her wishes. \n\nThe key points here are the severity of the friend's actions\u2014threatening self-harm, harassment, and stalking behavior. The author's intervention was to stop this behavior. The question is whether the author's approach was wrong. The friends agreed with the author but thought a nicer approach might have worked. However, given the urgency and the potential danger, a direct approach might have been necessary. \n\nThe author's words, \"creepy and pathetic,\" might seem harsh, but the intent was to prevent further harm. The alternative could be to let the friend continue harmful actions, which could lead to more serious consequences. So the author was trying to help, even if the method was a bit harsh. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's actions are problematic, and the author was trying to address them. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up to the friend's behavior to protect both the friend and the ex. The answer should be B (No).\n"
