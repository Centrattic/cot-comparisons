He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The writer told their friend to stop, and the friend got angry and kicked them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was in a relationship where he was pushing too fast, leading to the breakup. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The writer intervened, telling him he's being creepy and that she doesn't want to get back together. The friend reacted badly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The answer should be based on the situation described. \n\nThe writer's actions were to stop their friend from stalking or harassing the ex. The friends agree with the writer's sentiment but thought the approach could have been nicer. However, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic and potentially harmful. The writer's intent was to help, even if the delivery was harsh. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the main consideration is whether the action was justified given the circumstances. The writer was trying to protect the friend from himself and the ex. Even though they might have handled it in a more compassionate way, the core message was correct. The friend's behavior needed to stop. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were addressing a serious issue that others agree with, even if the method could have been improved.\n"
