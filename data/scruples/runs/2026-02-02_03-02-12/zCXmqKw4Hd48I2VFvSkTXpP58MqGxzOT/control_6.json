He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, the context: The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was moving too fast, which led to the breakup. The friend then started threatening self-harm, calling the ex, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, after multiple instances of this behavior, told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the friend is acting in a way that's borderline stalker-like post-breakup. The author is trying to help him stop. The friend's actions are concerning and potentially harmful, both to himself and the ex. The author's friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's behavior is definitely problematic. The author intervened, even if the method was harsh. The friends concur that the friend needs to stop, so the intent was good. But the friend took offense and kicked them out. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is pointing out real issues. The friend might not want to hear it, but the behavior is inappropriate. The author's approach could have been more empathetic, but the core message is valid. So the answer is likely B, not in the wrong. The problem is the friend's actions, not the author's attempt to address them.\n"
