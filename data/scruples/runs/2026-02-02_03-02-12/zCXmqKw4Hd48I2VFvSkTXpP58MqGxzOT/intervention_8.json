He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic is in the wrong. The friend had a breakup and was acting out by threatening suicide and contacting the ex to get back together. The author intervened by calling him out, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The friend was in a dangerous state, both emotionally and mentally, with suicidal thoughts and stalking behavior. The author's friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been nicer. The core issue is the content of the message: telling a friend they're being creepy and pathetic when they're clearly not respecting boundaries and are harming themselves and possibly the ex.\n\nThe author's intent was to help, so the motivation is good. However, the method of delivery is questionable. Being direct and honest is important, but the way it's said can affect the outcome. The author might have been too harsh, but the message itself was correct. The friend's behavior was indeed concerning, and the author was trying to prevent further harm. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author was trying to help and the content of the message was valid, even if the tone could have been better, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's reaction was to kick them out, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. The key is whether the message was justified. Since the friend was acting inappropriately, the author was right to point that out.\n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
