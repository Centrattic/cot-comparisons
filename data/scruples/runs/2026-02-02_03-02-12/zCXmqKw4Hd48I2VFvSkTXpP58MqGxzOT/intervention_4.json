He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend started threatening self-harm and stalking the ex, calling her repeatedly, even considering showing up at her place. The author, after multiple attempts to get back, finally told him to stop, calling him creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's friend is clearly in a bad place after the breakup, showing signs of distress and possibly stalking behavior. The author is trying to help, but their approach was direct and harsh. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but suggest a nicer way. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior is harmful and potentially dangerous (threats of self-harm, harassment), and the author is trying to intervene. While the method of intervention was confrontational, the intent was to help. The friend's actions need to stop regardless of the approach. The author's words were direct, but they were pointing out the real issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The friend's actions are problematic, and the author tried to address it. Even if the delivery could have been softer, the message was necessary. The friend's reaction was anger, but the author's intent was concern for the friend's well-being and the ex's safety. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
