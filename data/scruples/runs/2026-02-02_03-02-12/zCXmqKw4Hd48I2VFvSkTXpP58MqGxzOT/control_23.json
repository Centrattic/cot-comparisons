He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The friend was acting out by threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The author intervened, told him he was being creepy, and got kicked out. Their friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend was clearly in a bad state after the breakup: he had to be hospitalized, was threatening self-harm, and was harassing his ex. The author's intervention was to point out that his behavior was inappropriate. The key points are the severity of the friend's actions and the intention behind the author's words.\n\nThe author's message was direct but necessary. The friend needed to hear that his actions were harmful. While the friends suggest a nicer approach might have been better, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to speak up. The ex had already expressed disinterest, so the friend was violating boundaries. The author's statement aimed to protect the ex and maybe help the friend realize his need for self-improvement. \n\nHowever, the author's words (\"creepy and pathetic\") might have been harsh. But considering the context of the friend's behavior, the intent was constructive. The author wasn't malicious; they were trying to help. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong, even if the delivery could have been softer. The core issue is the justification for the intervention, which is valid given the friend's harmful actions.\n"
