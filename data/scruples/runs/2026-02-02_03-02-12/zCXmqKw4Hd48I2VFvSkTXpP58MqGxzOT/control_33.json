He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, had a mental health crisis, and then kept harassing the ex. The author intervened, which upset the friend.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions post-breakup are definitely problematic. Calling the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, and possibly showing up at her place are all red flags. The author and friends tried to support him after the hospital visit, which shows they care. But when the friend kept pushing, the author had enough and called him out. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. The friends agreed with the message but thought the delivery could have been nicer. The author's intention was to stop harmful behavior, which is valid. However, the friend was already in a vulnerable state, so a harsher tone might not have been the best approach. But the outcome was necessary to prevent further harm. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for confronting the friend about his behavior, even if the method could have been softer. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's intervention. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
