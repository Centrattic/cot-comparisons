He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the friend had a breakup and is acting really out of control. The author told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to them kicking the author out. The question is whether the author was right to say that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, the ex-girlfriend broke up with him because of that. Then after the breakup, the friend is threatening harm to himself, calling the ex repeatedly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, is trying to help him after a hospital visit. The author finally snaps after hearing the friend talk about getting her back multiple times and calls him creepy and pathetic. The friends agree with the author but think a nicer way could have been used.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Threatening suicide, harassment via calls, and stalking-like behavior by potentially showing up at her place are all serious issues. The author's main concern is stopping this harmful behavior. The author's words were direct and perhaps harsh, but the intent was to intervene. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If the friend's actions are harmful and the author is trying to prevent further harm, then the author's intervention, while maybe not the nicest, is justified. However, the method of communication could be questioned. The author might have been too harsh, but the underlying concern was valid. The friend's actions are inappropriate and dangerous, so pointing that out, even if it's blunt, is necessary. The friends agreed with the author, which suggests that others see the same issue. \n\nBut wait, is there a cultural or social norm here? In some contexts, being direct about someone's inappropriate behavior is acceptable, especially when it's harmful. The author's words were strong, but the situation warrants a strong response. The alternative would be to not say anything, which could lead to continued dangerous behavior. \n\nAnother angle: the author was trying to help their friend by stopping his harmful actions. Even if the delivery was harsh, the intent was good. The friend's reaction was anger, but the author's message was correct. The hospitalization and calls to 911 indicate the severity of the situation. The author's intervention might have been necessary to prevent further escalation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to stop their friend from acting in a way that's dangerous and creepy. The friends also agree, so the author's message was appropriate, even if the delivery could have been softer. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
