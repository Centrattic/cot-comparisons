He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting really badly after a breakup. The friend, who's 22, had a relationship where he was pushing for marriage, then got dumped because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling the ex, and considering showing up at her place. The author confronts him, calls him creepy and pathetic, tells him to stop, and gets kicked out. Friends think the author was right but could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The key points are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's making threats, having suicidal thoughts, and stalking behavior. The author stepped in to stop this, which seems necessary. But the method\u2014calling him creepy and pathetic\u2014might have been harsh, even if the message was correct.\n\nIs there a duty to intervene when someone is in emotional distress? Possibly. The author and friends were already involved, taking turns to support him. The author's outburst was after repeated attempts to get the friend to stop. While the words might not have been the kindest, the intent was to help. The friend's actions are clearly problematic and could lead to legal issues if he follows through on confronting the ex. The author is trying to prevent harm to the friend and the ex. \n\nBut was the author wrong to say those things? The friend was in a fragile state. AITA questions often consider both the rightness of the action and the approach. Even if the message is valid, the delivery can matter. However, given the urgency of preventing dangerous behavior, the author's approach, though harsh, was necessary. The friends agreeing with the author suggests that the core message was right. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The author's actions were justified despite the harshness because the friend was in a crisis and needed to hear it.\n"
