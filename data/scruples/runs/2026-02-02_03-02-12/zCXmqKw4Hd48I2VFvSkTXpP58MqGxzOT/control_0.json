He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after his breakup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage, maybe moving too fast. The girl broke up with him because he needed to work on himself and anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling her non-stop, threatening self-harm, even considering showing up at her place. The author, who's trying to help, tells their friend he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight where the friend kicks them out.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Let's consider angles. The friend's actions are clearly stalking and harassing, which is unhealthy and potentially dangerous. The author is trying to intervene to protect both their friend and the ex. The friend was already in crisis, requiring a hospital visit. The author's approach might have been harsh, but they're right in pointing out the unacceptable behavior. The friends agree the behavior should stop, even if the delivery could be softer. However, the author's words might have been a necessary intervention. The key is whether the author overstepped. Since the friend's actions are harmful, the author's message, while direct, is valid. The answer likely leans to B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing dangerous behavior, even if the method could be improved.\n"
