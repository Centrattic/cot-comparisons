He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out by threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The author's friends agree with them but think it could have been handled more nicely.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening suicide, relentless calls, and harassment. The author's friends supported the action but suggested a nicer approach. The author's response was direct and maybe harsh, but the actions of the friend were inappropriate. \n\nIs the author's way of confronting the friend the right approach? The friend was in a crisis, post-hospital, so maybe the author's tone could have been adjusted. However, the friend needed to hear that his actions were wrong. The key is whether the author's method was reasonable given the circumstances. The friends agreed, so maybe it's justified. The author's words were harsh but truthful. The friend's behavior was creepy and needed to stop. The author's intention was to help, even if the delivery was rough. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The behavior of the friend was unacceptable, and the author was trying to stop it, even if the approach could have been softer. The friends agreed, so it's not a case of the author being in the wrong.\n"
