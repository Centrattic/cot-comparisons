He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend about being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm, and trying to get back with the ex. The author told them off, leading to being kicked out. Friends think the message was right but maybe the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend was clearly in a bad state after the breakup, showing signs of mental health issues with self-harm threats. The author's friend was acting in a way that's not healthy\u2014harassment and stalking behavior by constantly calling and wanting to confront the ex. The author intervened when the friend was in a crisis but had already been hospitalized. \n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions post-breakup. Threatening self-harm is a serious issue, but the friend's behavior towards the ex is problematic. The author's message was that the friend was being creepy and pathetic, which might come off as harsh, especially if the friend is already emotionally fragile. However, the friends agree that the message was correct, just the delivery could have been kinder.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the content of the message\u2014telling the friend to stop being creepy and to respect the ex's wishes\u2014is valid. The friend's actions were inappropriate, and the author was trying to help, even if the approach was blunt. The friend's response was to kick them out, which shows defensiveness but not necessarily that the author was wrong. \n\nThe author's friends agree with the message, so there's support. However, the way it was delivered might have been unkind. But given the circumstances\u2014friend in crisis, repeated harmful behavior\u2014the content is justified. The author wasn't attacking the friend's character but pointing out specific harmful actions. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
