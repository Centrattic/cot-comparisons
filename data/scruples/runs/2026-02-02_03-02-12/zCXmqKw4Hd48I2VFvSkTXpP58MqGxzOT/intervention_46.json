He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's being really clingy and threatening after a breakup. The author told the friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was with a girl for eight months, talked about marriage, but she broke up because he was moving too fast. After the breakup, he's exhibiting extreme behavior\u2014threatening self-harm, calling her non-stop, even considering showing up at her place. The author, after trying to help, snaps and tells him to stop, calling him creepy and pathetic. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. Friends agree with the author but think they could have phrased it better.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified.\n\nThe friend's behavior is clearly problematic. Threatening self-harm and harassment are serious issues. The author was trying to help but reached a breaking point. Calling someone creepy and pathetic is harsh, but in this context, is it justified? The author's intent was to stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions are abusive towards the ex and potentially self-harmful. The author's words, while direct, might be necessary to intervene. The friends agree, suggesting that the message was valid even if the delivery could have been softer.\n\nHowever, could there have been a better way to communicate this? Maybe, but the situation was escalating. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to prevent further harm. The key here is that the author is trying to protect the ex and the friend from himself. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
