He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, made grand promises, then the girl broke up because he was moving too fast. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling her non-stop, and even threatening to go to her place. The author, along with friends, tried to help him, but when the friend kept talking about getting her back, the author snapped and called him creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked them out. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's not just sad; he's engaging in stalking-like behavior, threatening self-harm, and not respecting her decision. The author is concerned about his friend's well-being but also the safety of the ex. \n\nThe author's actions: they intervened directly when the friend was behaving in a way that's clearly harmful. The friends agreed with the message but thought the delivery could have been softer. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nIn such cases, it's important to consider both the friend's mental health and the ex's safety. However, the friend's actions are definitely problematic. The author tried to help, but when the friend continued to spiral, pointing out the reality of the situation might be necessary. Even if the delivery was harsh, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. \n\nThe ex's safety is also a concern. The friend's actions could be considered harassment. The author is trying to prevent that. While there's merit in handling sensitive situations with care, the situation here seems extreme enough that the author's intervention was justified. They were trying to help a friend who needed to hear the hard truth, even if it came out harshly. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They were trying to stop their friend from acting in a dangerous and inappropriate manner after a breakup. The friends' agreement with the message despite the harsh delivery supports that. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's intervention.\n"
