He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing the relationship too fast, leading the girl to break up. After the breakup, the friend is acting irrationally\u2014threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and considering showing up at her place. The author, after a hospitalization, confronts their friend and tells them to stop, calling them creepy and pathetic. The friend gets angry and kicks the author out. The author's friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014he's stalking, threatening self-harm, and not respecting the breakup. The author is trying to intervene to protect their friend and the ex. The author's message is direct but accurate. While the delivery could have been kinder, the content is valid. The friends who agree with the author support the message, even if they think the tone could be improved. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to help a friend in a harmful situation. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) might indicate he's in denial or not ready to hear the truth, but that doesn't make the author wrong. They're standing up for what's right, even if it's harsh. So, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
