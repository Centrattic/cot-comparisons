He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who spoke up to their friend is at fault. The friend was in a relationship that ended, and he's been acting out\u2014threatening suicide, calling the ex constantly, considering showing up uninvited. The author told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions are clearly problematic. Stalking behavior, suicidal threats, and not respecting the ex's wishes are all red flags. The author was trying to help their friend by calling out the harmful behavior. Even though the delivery might have been harsh, the intent was to intervene.\n\nBut wait, the author's friends said they agree with the sentiment but maybe the approach could have been nicer. So, the core issue is whether the author's intervention was justified. The key points are the friend's dangerous behavior and the author's effort to stop it. \n\nThe ex has made it clear she doesn't want to get back together, so the friend's persistence is not just unwise but potentially abusive. The author's words, while harsh, were aimed at preventing further harm. In such situations, it's important to address the behavior even if the method isn't perfect. The friend's actions could lead to legal or emotional harm, so the author's role in stopping that isn't wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help their friend, even if the approach could have been better. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's intervention.\n"
