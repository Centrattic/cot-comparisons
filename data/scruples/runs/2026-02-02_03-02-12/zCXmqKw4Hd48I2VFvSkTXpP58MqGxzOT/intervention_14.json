He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting really obsessively, threatening self-harm, and trying to get back with the ex. The author stepped in and told him to stop, which made the friend angry and kicked them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was in a toxic post-breakup state, showing signs of stalking or harassment. The author's friends agreed with them, even if they thought the delivery could be softer. The key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the situation.\n\nThe author intervened to protect the ex and their friend. Even though the friend was upset, the author's message was accurate\u2014the friend was acting inappropriately. The author didn't just criticize for fun; they were trying to help their friend get back on track and prevent further harm. The friends' support suggests that the author's approach, while maybe harsh, was justified.\n\nI should also think about the intent. The author wanted to stop harmful behavior, not just hurt their friend's feelings. While the method could have been more compassionate, the core message was right. The friend was in a vulnerable state, but the author's actions were aimed at helping, not harming.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author acted in a way to prevent further issues, even if the delivery was rough. The main point is stopping unhealthy behavior, which the author did.\n"
