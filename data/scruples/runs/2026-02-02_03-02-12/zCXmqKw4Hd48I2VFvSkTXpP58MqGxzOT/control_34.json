He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe friend, who's 22, was in an 8-month relationship where he was very eager, talking about marriage. The breakup happened because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, wanting to confront her in person. The author, along with friends, took turns supporting him, but when it was the author's turn, they snapped after hearing about getting her back multiple times. The author told the friend he was being creepy and pathetic, which led to a fight and being kicked out. The friends think the author could have been nicer but agree with the message.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was wrong. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's engaging in stalking or harassing behavior, which is problematic. The author is trying to intervene to stop this. The friend's actions are concerning and potentially harmful. The author's approach was direct and harsh, but the friends agree with the content, just the delivery could be better. However, the author's intent was to help, not harm. The friend's response was to kick them out, which is his choice, but the author isn't in the wrong for trying to help. The line between being supportive and confrontational is thin here. The author's message is valid, even if delivered poorly. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
