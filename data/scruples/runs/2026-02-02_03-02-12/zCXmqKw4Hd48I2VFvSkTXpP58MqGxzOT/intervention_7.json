He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months, and he was really pushing for a future with her, like marriage. Then she broke up with him because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend had a mental breakdown, leading to a 911 call and hospitalization. He's been threatening suicide, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place to \"ask in person.\"\n\nThe author, along with friends, took turns supporting him. On their turn, the author snapped and told him he was being creepy and pathetic, emphasizing that the ex doesn't want to get back together. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The author's friends agree with the sentiment but think a nicer approach might have been better.\n\nSo, the question is: Was the author right to confront their friend like that?\n\nFrom what I understand, the key points are the friend's stalking behavior, threats of self-harm, and harassment towards the ex. The author's message was to stop that behavior because it's harmful and clear the ex isn't interested. The friend's actions are definitely not okay\u2014stalking, harassment, and potential self-harm are serious issues. The author was trying to help by pointing out the inappropriate behavior, even if the delivery was harsh.\n\nHowever, the friend was already in a fragile mental state. The author might have considered a more compassionate approach, but the core message\u2014stopping the harmful actions\u2014was valid. The friend's response (getting angry and kicking out) shows resistance, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. The friends also agreed with the message, suggesting that the content was right even if the tone could have been improved.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for the main message. The issue is the method, but the intent was to help. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
