He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend was being obsessive and threatening after a breakup, and the author told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he was contacting the ex excessively, even to the point of threatening self-harm and possibly showing up at her place. The author, concerned about his friend's behavior, confronted him directly and told him he was being creepy and pathetic, which caused the friend to kick him out.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong for speaking up. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider the context: the friend's actions could be considered harassment or stalking, especially if he was following up on the ex or making threats. The author was trying to intervene before things escalated further. \n\nHowever, confrontation style matters. The author's friends agreed with the message but thought a nicer approach could have worked. The question is whether the message itself was wrong. If the friend's behavior was harmful or dangerous, then pointing it out is justified. The author might have been trying to protect the friend's mental health and prevent further harm, even if the delivery was harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. But the core issue is whether the content of the message (calling him creepy and pathetic) was inappropriate. The friend's actions were problematic, so the author's feedback was valid. The friend's reaction was to kick them out, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author was addressing harmful behavior, which is reasonable, even if the delivery could be improved. The main issue is the content of the message, which was appropriate given the situation.\n"
