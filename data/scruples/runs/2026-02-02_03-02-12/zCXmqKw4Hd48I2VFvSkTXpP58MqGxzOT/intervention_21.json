He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting out after a breakup, and the author confronts him about his behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, made grandiose claims, and the breakup was due to him moving too fast and needing to work on himself. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, stalking the ex, and being persistent in trying to get her back. The author, along with friends, tried to support him after a hospital visit but finally snapped when he kept talking about getting her back. The author told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Stalking, threatening self-harm, and not respecting the ex's wishes are serious issues. The author is concerned for their friend's well-being but also the ex's safety. Confronting someone about harmful behavior is a sensitive topic. The friends mentioned that they agree with the author's sentiment but thought the delivery could be improved.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they directly addressed the friend's harmful behavior, which others agreed with. While the delivery might have been harsh, the intent was to stop dangerous actions. The friend's reaction was anger, but the author's message was valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for speaking up.\n\nIn such cases, it's important to balance honesty with compassion. The author's message was necessary, even if the approach could have been softer. The friend's actions are problematic, and the author's intervention was to prevent further harm. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
