He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm and stalking the ex. The author told him he was being creepy and pathetic, which led to a fallout.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's violating the ex's wishes, which is harassment. The author's friends also agree with the action, though they suggest it could have been done nicer. The key point is whether the author crossed a line in how they delivered the message.\n\nThe author's main goal was to stop the harmful behavior. Even if the tone was harsh, the intent was to help. The friend was already in crisis, so maybe a softer approach was needed, but the message itself was necessary. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to protect the ex and their friend from his own actions. So the answer should be B.\n"
