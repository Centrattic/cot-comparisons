He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out by threatening suicide and stalking the ex.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is definitely concerning. He was moving too fast in the relationship, then after the breakup, he started threatening harm and calling the ex constantly. The author and friends had to call 911 because he was a danger to himself. Then, the author confronts him about being creepy. \n\nThe author's friends agree with them, even though they think the approach could have been nicer. The key point here is whether the author's message was justified. The ex has made it clear she doesn't want to reconcile, so the friend's actions are violating her boundaries. The author is trying to help him stop, which seems supportive, even if the delivery was harsh.\n\nBut the friend might feel attacked, leading to the argument that the author could have been more empathetic. However, given the severity of the friend's behavior, the author's intervention might be necessary to prevent further harm. So the question is whether the content of the message (calling him creepy and pathetic) was wrong, regardless of tone.\n\nIn terms of ethics, stopping someone from harassing an ex is generally seen as right. Using strong language might be a judgment call, but the intent was to protect the ex and help the friend. So probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
