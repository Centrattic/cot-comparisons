He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy and pathetic after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The friend was with a girl for eight months and made big commitments like marriage. She broke up with him because he moved too fast and has anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling her non-stop, and considering harassing her. The author steps in after multiple calls to the friend's self-harm, telling him he's being creepy and that the girl doesn't want him back. The friend gets angry and kicks them out.\n\nNow, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Threatening self-harm if she doesn't come back, constant calls, and wanting to confront her. That's definitely concerning and possibly dangerous. The author's friends agree with them, even if they think the delivery could've been nicer.\n\nThe author's actions were to confront the friend about his behavior, which is necessary for his well-being and the ex's safety. Telling someone they're being creepy when they're acting that way isn't wrong. Even if the approach could have been softer, the intent was to help. The friend's actions (like threatening self-harm if she doesn't return) are red flags. The author is trying to prevent further harm, both to the friend and the ex.\n\nBut wait, was there a better way? The friends say they agree but maybe a nicer way. But the author was fed up after multiple times. So the main question is: does the friend's behavior justify the author's response? Since the author is trying to intervene in a problematic situation, their actions are in good faith. They're not in the wrong because the friend was acting in a way that's clearly inappropriate and potentially dangerous. The author's intervention is necessary even if it came off harshly. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
