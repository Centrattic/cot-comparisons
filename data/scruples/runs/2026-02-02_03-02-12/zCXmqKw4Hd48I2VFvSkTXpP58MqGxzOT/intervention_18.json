He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the friend was in an 8-month relationship, made a lot of big promises early on. Then the girl broke up because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself. The friend had a mental breakdown, leading to a hospital visit. He's been threatening self-harm, constantly contacting her, and talking about confronting her in person. The author, after trying to help, finally snapped and told him to stop acting creepy and pathetic because the girl doesn't want to get back together. The friend got angry and kicked them out. Their friends agree but think a nicer approach might have been possible.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they're not. I need to consider the facts. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014harassment, threats of self-harm, stalking behavior. The author is trying to intervene, which could be seen as necessary. However, the way they did it was direct and maybe harsh, but their friends agree that the behavior needed to stop. The key points are intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to protect their friend from further harm and to prevent harassment. The message they conveyed was accurate: the girl doesn't want to get back together. The method might not have been the most compassionate, but the content was justified. The friend's reaction was anger, but that's more about his mental state than the author's rightness. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
