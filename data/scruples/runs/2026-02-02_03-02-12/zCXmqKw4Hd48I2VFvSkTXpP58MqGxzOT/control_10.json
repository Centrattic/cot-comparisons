He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend was in a relationship for eight months, got dumped because he moved too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014calling 911, threatening self-harm, constantly contacting the ex, and even considering showing up at her place. The author steps in, tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here. The friend is clearly in a bad state, maybe even a mental health crisis. The author is trying to intervene to stop his unhealthy behavior. The problem is how they communicated it. The author lost it and called him creepy and pathetic. While the message might be valid, the delivery could have been harsh. The friends agree with the message but suggest a nicer way. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. From an ethical standpoint, the author's intent was to help, but the method might have been too aggressive. However, the behavior the author is addressing is problematic and could be emotionally harmful or even stalking. The author is right to point out that the friend is acting inappropriately, even if the delivery was rough. \n\nBut, the author could have approached it more compassionately, maybe expressing concern and offering support rather than shaming. However, given the urgency of stopping harmful behavior, the author might not be in the wrong for being direct. So the answer would be B (No), because the author is justified in confronting the friend's harmful actions, even if the approach could have been more tactful.\n"
