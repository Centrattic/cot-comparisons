He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault. The scenario involves a friend who's acting inappropriately after a breakup. The friend was moved too fast in the relationship, leading to the breakup. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling the ex, and even considering showing up at her place. The author intervened by telling him he's being creepy and pathetic, which led to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. The friend was clearly in a bad state, with suicidal thoughts and stalking behaviors. The author tried to stop him from continuing harmful actions. The friends agree with the message but think it could have been delivered more gently. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author's message was justified. The friend's actions are troubling and need to be addressed to protect the ex and possibly the friend himself. The author's intervention was to stop harmful behavior, which is a valid concern. Even though the delivery might have been harsh, the intent was to help. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for pointing out the problematic behavior. The friend needs to hear that his actions are unacceptable. While a kinder approach might have been better, the content of the message was correct. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
