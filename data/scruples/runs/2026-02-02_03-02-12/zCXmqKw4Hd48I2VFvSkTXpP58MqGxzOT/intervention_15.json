He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting out after a breakup, and the author confronted him about being creepy and pathetic.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend was with a girl for eight months, but she broke up with him because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself. After the breakup, the friend had a mental health crisis, leading to a 911 call and hospitalization. Now, he's constantly contacting the ex, threatening self-harm, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, frustrated, told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout where the friend kicked them out.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation. The question is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nKey points to consider: The author's intent was to stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions are clearly stalking-like and potentially dangerous, especially after a mental health crisis. The author's friends agree with the sentiment but suggest a nicer approach. The author might be right in pointing out the unacceptable behavior, even if the delivery was harsh.\n\nBut wait, was the author's approach appropriate? The friend was already in a vulnerable state, and the author's wording (\"creepy and pathetic\") might have been harsh. However, the content of the message\u2014that the friend needs to stop contacting the ex\u2014is crucial. The author was trying to protect the ex and their friend from further harm. Even if the delivery could have been kinder, the substance of the message is valid.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the person in the wrong here is the friend for stalking and threatening self-harm. The author is taking a stand against that behavior. So the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
