He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where the friend was moving too fast, got dumped, and then became obsessive, even threatening self-harm. The author intervened and told the friend to stop being creepy and that he's pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's behavior post-breakup is clearly concerning. He's threatening self-harm, calling the ex repeatedly, and even considering showing up uninvited. The author's friends agree with them but thought a nicer approach might have worked. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to help their friend by pointing out his unacceptable behavior. The friend's actions are indeed creepy and dangerous. The author's message was that the ex doesn't want to get back together and he needs to stop. Even though the delivery might have been harsh, the content is valid. The friend's actions cross boundaries and could lead to real harm, not just to himself but potentially to the ex. \n\nThe author didn't just criticize the friend; they addressed the harmful behavior. The friend's anger and response were likely due to the emotional pain he's experiencing, but that doesn't make the author wrong for pointing out the truth. Also, the friends agree with the sentiment, so the author isn't being malicious. \n\nHowever, the method of communication might have been an issue. Maybe a more compassionate approach could have been better received, but the author's message was necessary. The friend's actions require intervention, especially since there's a risk of self-harm. The author's words were a form of support, not just criticism. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
