We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months. He was moving too fast, making big promises like marriage, and the girl broke up because he needs to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is threatening self-harm, calling her constantly, and planning to show up at her place. The author and friends took turns helping him, but when it was the author's turn, they exploded and told him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked them out, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation. So, I need to evaluate if the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Threatening self-harm and harassing the ex are definitely problematic. The author's friends agree with the author's message, though they might have suggested a kinder approach. \n\nThe author's main action was confronting the friend about his behavior. While it's possible that the delivery could have been softer, the content of the message\u2014that the friend is being creepy and needs to stop\u2014is valid. The friend's actions are inappropriate and potentially dangerous, so the author's intervention was necessary to stop the behavior and maybe protect the ex. \n\nHowever, the author might have been too harsh, but harshness isn't necessarily wrong if it's to prevent harm. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) is a red flag, but it doesn't mean the author is wrong. The core issue is the friend's actions, not the author's response. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
