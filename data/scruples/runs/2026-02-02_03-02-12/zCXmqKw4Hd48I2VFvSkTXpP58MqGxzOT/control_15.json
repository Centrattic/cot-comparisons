He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who broke up with his girlfriend, and after the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and wanting to confront her. The author, a friend, told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The friend is exhibiting behaviors that are concerning\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking (calling multiple times, wanting to go to her place), and not respecting the breakup. The author intervened by confronting him, which the friend took badly, getting angry and kicking them out. The friends agree with the author's message but thought the delivery could have been kinder.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions are harmful and potentially dangerous. The author is trying to stop their friend from engaging in behavior that could escalate. Even if the delivery was harsh, the intent was to help. The key here is whether the author overstepped by calling them creepy and pathetic. While those words might be harsh, the underlying message is valid. The author isn't attacking their feelings but pointing out harmful actions. Friends often need honest feedback, especially when someone is in a crisis. The alternative would be not saying anything, which could let the behavior continue. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
