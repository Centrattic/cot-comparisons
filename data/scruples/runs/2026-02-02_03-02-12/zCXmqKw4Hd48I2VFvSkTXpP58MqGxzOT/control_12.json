He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who had a breakup and is acting in a way that's concerning. The author told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic, which led to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The friend was in a relationship that ended, and he's now acting out, threatening self-harm, contacting the ex, and possibly stalking her. The author intervened when they felt the behavior was inappropriate. \n\nThe key points here are: the ex expressed that she doesn't want to get back together, the friend is not respecting that, and the friend's actions could be considered harassment or stalking. The author's intervention was direct and honest, but maybe not the most tactful. \n\nLegally, following someone after a breakup and making threats could be problematic. The author's friend might be crossing lines, and the author is trying to help a friend who's in a bad state. The author's friends agree with the sentiment but think the delivery was harsh. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? They were trying to help a friend who's acting inappropriately. Even if the delivery could have been better, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions are the main issue here, not the author's words. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
