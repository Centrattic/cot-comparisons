He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic is in the wrong. The friend was in a relationship that ended, and he's acting out by threatening self-harm and trying to get back with her. The friend's actions are clearly problematic and could be considered stalker-like or obsessive.\n\nThe author, after multiple incidents, confronts their friend about his behavior, which the friends later agree with but suggest a nicer approach. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The key points here are the severity of the friend's actions\u2014threatening harm, constant harassment, and stalking behavior. The author is trying to stop their friend from doing something dangerous. \n\nWhile the way the author might have delivered the message could be smoother, the content of the message (that the friend is being creepy and needs to stop) is justified. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's response. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
