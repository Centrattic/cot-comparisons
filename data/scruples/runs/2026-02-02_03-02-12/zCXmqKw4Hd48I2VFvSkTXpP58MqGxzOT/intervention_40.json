He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong after confronting their friend about his behavior after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an eight-month relationship, where he pushed for commitment, saying \"the one\" stuff. The girl broke up because he was moving too fast and he has anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend was having a mental breakdown, threatening self-harm, and calling the ex to get back together. He even considered going to her place. The author, along with friends, took turns helping him post-hospital. The author snapped when the friend kept talking about getting her back and told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, the key points here: the friend's actions are clearly problematic. He's violating boundaries by harassing the ex, threatening self-harm, and showing no sign of stopping. The author is trying to help their friend by pointing out his unacceptable behavior. The friends agree with the author, though they think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nThe author's intent was to help the friend, not to be cruel. The friend's actions are harmful to himself and the ex. The author's words were direct but necessary. The friend's reaction was to kick them out, but that's his choice. The author didn't cross any lines that weren't already there. The main issue is whether confronting a friend about harmful behavior is wrong. Since the friend's actions are dangerous, the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up. They might have handled it differently, but the message was valid. So the answer is B.\n"
