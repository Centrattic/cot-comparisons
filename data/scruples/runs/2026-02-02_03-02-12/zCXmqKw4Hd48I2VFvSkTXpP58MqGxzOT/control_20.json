He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting really badly after a breakup, and the author told him he was being creepy and pathetic. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship where he was moving too fast, which led to the breakup. Then he's threatening self-harm and harassment, like calling his ex constantly and wanting to confront her in person. The author, after trying to help him, confronts him about his behavior. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's behavior is definitely problematic, even dangerous. The author tried to intervene in a time when the friend was emotionally unstable. The author's message was direct and harsh, but was it wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author is concerned about their friend's well-being and the ex's safety. Stopping the harassment is important. On the other hand, the friend was already in a fragile state, and the author's approach might have been too harsh, possibly triggering him. However, the author's friends agree with the message, just the delivery could have been softer. \n\nBut considering the friend's actions\u2014threatening self-harm and harassment\u2014it's a serious issue. The author was trying to prevent further harm. Even if the delivery was harsh, the intent was good. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the author's response. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
