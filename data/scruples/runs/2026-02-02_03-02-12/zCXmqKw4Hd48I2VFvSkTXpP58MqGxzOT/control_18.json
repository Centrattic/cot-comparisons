He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and she wanted him to work on himself. After the breakup, he started threatening self-harm, calling 911, and was taken to the hospital. He's been calling the ex nonstop and even considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, tried to support him but got fed up. The author confronted him, calling him creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out. Friends agree with the author but said it could have been handled nicer.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was right to confront the friend in that way. The friend's behavior is clearly concerning\u2014threats of self-harm, stalking behavior, not respecting the ex's decision. The author's friends support the author's stance, even if the approach was harsh. The author's intent was to stop the friend from acting out, which is a valid concern. However, the method\u2014calling him creepy and pathetic\u2014might have been harsh, but given the friend's actions, the author's message was necessary. The friend needed to hear that his actions were wrong, even if the delivery could have been improved. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help, even if the friend took it as an insult. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
