He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, contacting the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author steps in and calls him out directly, which leads to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Harassment, threatening self-harm, and stalking-like behavior are all red flags. The author intervened to stop this, even if the method was harsh. The friends agree with the author's sentiment, though they might think a softer approach could have worked. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong. The friend's actions are clearly problematic and potentially dangerous. The author was trying to prevent further harm to both the ex and the friend himself. While the delivery might have been rough, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
