He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style post) is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage, which the girl didn't reciprocate at that pace. The breakup was because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend's behavior escalated: threatening self-harm, constant calls to the ex, and even considering showing up at her place to confront her. The author, after trying to support the friend post-hospitalization, finally snapped and told him he was creepy and pathetic, leading to the friend kicking them out.\n\nThe core issue here is whether the author's confrontation was justified. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014stalking, harassment, and potential self-harm are serious issues. The author was trying to help by pointing out the unacceptable behavior. The friends agree with the author, even if they think a nicer approach might have worked.\n\nBut, the author did call the friend \"creepy and pathetic,\" which might be harsh. However, given the context of the friend's actions, the intent was to correct harmful behavior. The alternative could be not addressing it at all, which might let the behavior continue. So, while the delivery could have been softer, the message was necessary. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help a friend who's acting out in a dangerous way.\n"
