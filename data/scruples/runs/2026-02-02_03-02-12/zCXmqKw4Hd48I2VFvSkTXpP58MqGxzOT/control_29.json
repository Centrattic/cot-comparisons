He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who's acting out after a breakup, and the writer confronted him for being creepy and pathetic.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had issues with anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and considering showing up at her place. The writer steps in, tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop, which leads to being kicked out. The friends think the writer's right but maybe could've been nicer.\n\nSo, the main points here are the ex's behavior post-breakup, which seems obsessive and potentially abusive. The writer is trying to intervene to help both the ex and their friend. The question is whether the writer overstepped by calling him creepy and pathetic.\n\nOn one hand, the writer is concerned about their friend's well-being and the ex's safety. They're addressing harmful behavior that's not just affecting the ex but also their friend's mental health. On the other hand, the friend is in a vulnerable state, and the writer's approach might have been harsh, even if well-intentioned.\n\nThe key here is whether the writer's actions were justified in stopping harmful behavior. Confronting someone in emotional distress can be tricky, but the behavior described (threats, stalking, self-harm) is serious. The writer didn't just ignore it; they tried to intervene directly. Friends agree with the message, though the delivery could have been softer.\n\nI think the writer isn't in the wrong because they're trying to prevent further harm. The problem is the friend's actions, not the writer's intervention. So the answer should be B.\n"
