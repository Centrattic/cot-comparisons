He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was with a girl for eight months, and she broke up because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend started threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and even talking about going to her place to ask for a reunion. The author and friends took turns helping him post-hospital, and the author finally snapped after multiple requests to get back together. They told him he's being creepy and pathetic, and the friend kicked them out. The friends say the author could have been nicer but agree with their stance.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were justified. The friend's behavior\u2014threatening self-harm, persistent contact, and potential stalking\u2014is definitely concerning. The author's message was to stop the friend from being creepy and to accept the breakup. Even though the friend got angry and kicked them out, the content of the message seems valid. The author is supporting the friend's well-being but also trying to prevent harmful behavior. The friends' opinion is that while the delivery could have been kinder, the message was correct. So, the author's intent was to help, even if the approach was harsh. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are the validity of the message versus the method. The author isn't in the wrong for the message itself because they're addressing inappropriate behavior. However, the manner in which they delivered it might have been unhelpful, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the effectiveness of the communication. Since the friend's actions were problematic, the author's intervention was necessary. Therefore, the answer is No.\n"
