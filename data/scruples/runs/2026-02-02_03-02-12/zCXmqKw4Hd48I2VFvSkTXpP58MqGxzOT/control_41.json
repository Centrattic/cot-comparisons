He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, and then started threatening self-harm and trying to get back together. The author intervened, told them to stop, and the friend got angry and kicked them out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior is definitely problematic. Calling someone after a breakup, threatening self-harm, and trying to track them down is not okay. The author's friends agree that the friend's actions are wrong, but they also think the author could have handled it more nicely. The author's question is whether their reaction makes them \"in the wrong.\"\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the friend's actions are harmful and need to stop, 2) the author's intention was to help, even if the delivery was harsh, 3) the friend was already in a crisis, so their reaction is understandable but doesn't excuse their behavior.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to prevent further harm to the ex-girlfriend and to their friend. They were concerned enough to call 911 before, so their actions are protective. Even if they could have said it more gently, the content of the message was correct. The friend's anger is a reaction to being confronted, but the author isn't wrong for pointing out the problem. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
