He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and threatening to confront her. The poster intervened, told him he was being creepy and pathetic, and told him to stop. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The poster's friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014calling the ex repeatedly, making threats, potential stalking behavior. The poster is trying to stop their friend from doing something dangerous or illegal. The friend's actions might even be considered harassment. The poster's message was direct, but they were trying to prevent harm. \n\nThe question is whether the poster was wrong for being direct. While it's true that the approach could have been softer, the intent was to help. The main issue is the friend's behavior, not the poster's words. The poster isn't in the wrong for pointing out the problem. So, the answer should be B (No). The poster is trying to help a friend who's acting in a harmful way, even if the delivery was harsh.\n"
