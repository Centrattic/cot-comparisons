He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting really obsessively after a breakup. The friend was with his girlfriend for eight months, made grandiose marriage promises, then she broke up with him because he was moving too fast and needed to work on his anxiety. After the breakup, he started threatening self-harm, making constant calls to her, and even considering showing up uninvited. The author, along with friends, tried to help him, but when the author finally snapped and told him he was being creepy and pathetic, he got kicked out. The friends agreed with the author's sentiment but thought it could have been said nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's not just sad\u2014he's showing signs of obsessive behavior, potential stalking, and suicidal threats. The author intervened when the friend kept pushing boundaries, which might be necessary to protect the ex and prevent harm.\n\nThe author's approach was direct and harsh, calling him creepy and pathetic. While that's not the kindest way, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. The alternative would be doing nothing, which could lead to more issues. The friends agree with the author's stance, even if they think the delivery could have been softer. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The friend's actions are clearly problematic. The author tried to help over time, but when the friend wasn't heeding advice, a firmer approach was taken. While the words used were harsh, the intention was to help, not to be cruel. So, the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up. The answer should be B (No).\n"
