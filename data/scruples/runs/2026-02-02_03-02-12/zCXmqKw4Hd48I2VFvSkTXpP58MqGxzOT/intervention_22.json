He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy and pathetic after a breakup, and the writer told him off. So I need to figure out if the writer did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months and made grandiose claims about the girl being \"the one\" and marriage. Then he got dumped because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the girl repeatedly, and possibly planning to confront her in person. The writer, after trying to help him, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The writer's friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nHmm. So the writer is concerned about their friend's well-being but also about the friend's stalking or harassing behavior. The key points here are: the friend's actions post-breakup are clearly problematic. Threatening self-harm is a serious issue, and the writer and friends called 911, which shows they took it seriously. However, the friend isn't respecting the ex's decision and is engaging in behavior that's considered creepy. \n\nThe writer's intervention was direct but necessary. Even though the writer's friends suggested a nicer approach, the situation required stopping the unhealthy behavior. The fact that the friends agree with the message, just the delivery, suggests that the content was right. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the writer isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's harmful actions. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The writer was trying to help by setting a boundary, even if it came out harsh. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
