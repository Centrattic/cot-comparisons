He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm, and stalking the ex. The author called him out, leading to a fight and being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend was in a bad state after the breakup, showing erratic behavior. The author intervened to stop the friend from continuing to harass the ex. The key points are: the friend was moving too fast in the relationship, leading to the breakup. After the breakup, the friend was threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and considering showing up uninvited. The author and friends tried to support him but eventually, the author had to set a boundary.\n\nThe author's action was direct but perhaps harsh. They called the friend creepy and pathetic. But given the friend's behavior, the author was trying to prevent further harm. Friends often need to step in when someone's actions are harmful. However, the way the author communicated it might have been abrasive. The friends agreed with the author but thought it could have been done nicer. \n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong. The friend was clearly in a problematic state, and the author's intention was to help. Even if the delivery was rough, the intent was good. The alternative would be to let the friend continue harmful behavior, which isn't helping. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
