He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even thinking about going to her place. The author, after trying to support their friend, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend gets angry and kicks them out.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. I need to answer A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic and potentially dangerous. He's threatening self-harm, stalking the ex, and not respecting her wishes to end the relationship. The author's friends agree that the behavior needs to stop, so they're not alone in thinking that. \n\nThe author tried to support their friend after the hospital visit, but after multiple instances of hearing the friend talk about getting his ex back, they finally confront him. The author's message was direct but truthful. The friend's reaction was to kick them out, but maybe that's a result of his emotional state rather than the author's approach. \n\nEven though the author could have phrased it more gently, the content of the message was valid. The ex has made it clear she doesn't want to get back together, so the friend's actions are indeed creepy and not healthy. The author was trying to help their friend realize this, which is a responsible action. \n\nHowever, the method of confrontation might be a point of discussion. The user's friends mentioned that a nicer approach could have worked, but the key is whether the author was wrong in the message itself. The author's intention was to stop harmful behavior, which is a valid reason. \n\nIn situations where someone is acting in a way that could harm themselves or others, friends often need to step in. The author's actions, while maybe harsh in delivery, were aimed at helping their friend. So the author is not in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to stop harmful behavior, even if the delivery could have been kinder. The essence of the message was correct.\n"
