He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The friend was in an 8-month relationship, moved too fast, got dumped, then is threatening suicide and contacting the ex to get her back. The author told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout. The friend kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but said they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking the ex. The author was trying to intervene. Even though they might have been harsh, the intent was good. The friend's actions are unhealthy, and the author is concerned. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, intent matters. The author's goal was to help a friend who was in distress but acting out. While the delivery might have been rude, the content of the message (stopping creepy behavior) is justified. The friend was already in a crisis, so maybe the author should have been more empathetic, but the core issue is the friend's unacceptable actions. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author is trying to help, even if their approach could have been better. The friend's actions are the main problem here. The author isn't the one being creepy; they're calling out their friend. The friends agree, so there's support for the author's stance.\n"
