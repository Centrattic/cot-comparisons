He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was with a girl for eight months, claimed she was \"the one,\" but she broke up with him because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling her non-stop, and even threatening to go to her place. The author and friends intervened, and when it was the author's turn to help, they snapped and told the friend he was being creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked them out, and friends agree the author was right but maybe could have phrased it nicer.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me think about the ethical aspects here. The friend is in emotional distress, which is a red flag. The author's friend is acting out in a way that's not just emotional but potentially dangerous\u2014threatening suicide, stalking behavior (calling repeatedly, wanting to confront the ex in person). The author's response was to confront him directly, which might have been harsh but was necessary to stop the harmful behavior. \n\nThe key here is the balance between empathy and the need to address destructive behavior. The author's friends agree that the behavior needed to be addressed, but maybe the delivery could have been softer. However, the content of the message was accurate\u2014his actions were indeed creepy and persistent despite clear rejection. The author's intent was to help, not harm, by making the friend understand the need to stop. \n\nAlso, considering the friend's mental health here is important. The author might have caused some hurt feelings, but was it the right action? The alternative is to stay silent and let the friend continue in a harmful cycle, which could lead to more serious consequences, like actual harm to himself or her. \n\nIn situations where someone is in a harmful state, friends often have to step in, even if the approach isn't perfect. The author's actions were aimed at stopping the friend from escalating his behavior. The fact that other friends agree supports the idea that the content was correct, even if the delivery could have been better. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to help a friend in a problematic emotional state, even if the confrontation was direct. The answer should be B (No).\n"
