He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic following a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship where he pushed for marriage, but the girl broke up because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling her non-stop, and even considering showing up at her place. The author steps in to tell him to stop, which leads to the friend kicking them out. Friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's actions post-breakup. Harassment, threats of self-harm, and persistent unwanted contact are clear red flags. The author's intervention is to stop this behavior, which is reasonable. While the approach might not have been the most empathetic, the message is valid. The friend's actions are indeed problematic, and the author is trying to prevent further harm, both to the ex and potentially to the friend himself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're addressing harmful behavior, even if the delivery could be smoother. The situation justifies the intervention. Answer B.\n"
