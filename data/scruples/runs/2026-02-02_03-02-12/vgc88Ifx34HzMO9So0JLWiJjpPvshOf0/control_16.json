Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccinating their future children, and the author is giving an ultimatum based on that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and discussed an alternative schedule. They agreed on some sort of vaccination plan. However, now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine, which the author's healthcare background makes them cautious about. The author sets a limit of a one-month delay before starting vaccinations, and the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author is standing by their commitment to vaccinate the kids, which is a personal health decision they've made. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is changing her stance, despite previous agreements. The author has tried presenting data and evidence, but she's not budging. The ultimatum is about the author setting a boundary on a core value for them. \n\nIn relationships, when one partner's non-negotiables are met with resistance, it's a tough spot. The author isn't forcing vaccines but is setting a limit on when they can start. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because the author is firm, but she changed her position after agreeing earlier. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the author is protecting their core value, which is vaccination. The fianc\u00e9e's current stance is against that, even after prior agreement. The author's approach is to find a middle ground but has a limit. The fianc\u00e9e labeling the ultimatum as manipulative might be a tactic to avoid the discussion. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's shift in position and refusal to compromise could be the issue here. Given that the author tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule) and the fianc\u00e9e is now opposing it without valid medical reasons, the responsibility lies with her. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary.\n"
