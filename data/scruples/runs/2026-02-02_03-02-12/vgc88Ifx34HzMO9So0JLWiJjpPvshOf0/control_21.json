Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, and he was okay with that as long as the kids get vaccinated eventually. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed to vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. He proposed a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. She's reacting strongly, calling him manipulative and abusive. He's a healthcare worker, so he's concerned about risks from others. He's shown her data from WHO and CDC, but she's not convinced.\n\nThe key points here are consent and compromise. The author set boundaries based on his values and profession. He tried to meet her halfway with a delayed schedule. She, however, is now resistant and even more anti-vax, despite previous agreements. The ultimatum is about his non-negotiable stance. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's core values. The author's stance on vaccination is a significant health issue, especially since he's in healthcare. His offer to delay for a month is a compromise, but she's not willing to accept it now. The question is whether forcing a compromise on this issue is wrong. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have rights to medical decisions for their children, but both parents should agree. If she's unwilling to vaccinate at all, that's a major conflict. The author is setting boundaries to protect his future children's health, which is a valid concern. However, using an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. \n\nBut considering he's already offered a middle ground (alternative schedule with a delay) and she's refusing, maybe his stance isn't unreasonable. The issue is whether his ultimatum is manipulative or a necessary boundary. Since she agreed initially but has since changed her mind, he's acting on his commitment to vaccination. \n\nIn terms of fairness, he's trying to protect his child's health based on his profession and beliefs. Her refusal to budge might be the real issue here. So, the answer would depend on whether the ultimatum is a reasonable boundary or an overreach. Given the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing by his health convictions and making a compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to accept the proposed solution is the main problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
