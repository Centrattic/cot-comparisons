Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the engagement, and they discussed alternative schedules. The author agreed to an alternative schedule but set a limit: the baby can't start vaccinations until one month of age. The fianc\u00e9e is now against all vaccines, even the Hep B vaccine given at birth, which the author acknowledges is unlikely but still important. She's upset that the author is giving an ultimatum, calling it manipulative and abusive. \n\nThe author is a healthcare worker, so they likely have strong reasons for wanting to follow a vaccination schedule. They\u2019ve tried to present data and evidence, but the fianc\u00e9e remains unconvinced, even with WHO and CDC information. The author is willing to walk away from the engagement if she doesn't agree to the one-month delay.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on their knowledge and profession. However, the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are deeply held, even if they're based on misinformation. The author is setting a boundary, which is their right, but is it wrong to give an ultimatum in this situation?\n\nIn terms of relationships, when values are incompatible, sometimes people have to make tough decisions. The author is prioritizing their stance on vaccines, which is a significant medical decision. But the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and manipulated, which can be a red flag. The question is whether the ultimatum crosses into being controlling or abusive. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing firm on a non-negotiable issue. On the other, they might be using the ultimatum as a way to force compliance, which can be seen as disrespectful to the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy. However, since they've already discussed this and set boundaries, maybe the author isn't in the wrong if they truly believe vaccines are essential and the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to compromise.\n\nBut then again, is it wrong to end a relationship over this? The author wants to protect their child's health, which is a valid concern. However, the fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are her own, even if they're misguided. The author might be right in their stance, but the way they're enforcing it could be problematic if it's seen as coercive.\n\nI think the key here is whether the ultimatum is reasonable. The author gave some flexibility (one-month delay) but the fianc\u00e9e still refuses. The author is in a profession where they understand the importance of vaccines. However, the fianc\u00e9e's emotional response and the accusation of manipulation suggest that the ultimatum might be causing significant stress in the relationship. \n\nIn the end, it's a matter of personal ethics and relationship dynamics. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their child, but the method of using an ultimatum could be seen as heavy-handed. However, given that they tried to find a middle ground and the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging, the author might not be at fault. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because they're setting a boundary for their child's health, even if the approach is firm.\n"
