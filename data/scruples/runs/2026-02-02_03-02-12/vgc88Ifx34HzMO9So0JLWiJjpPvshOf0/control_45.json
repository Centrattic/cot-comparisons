Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Redit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author gives an ultimatum regarding their children's vaccination schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that he knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now she's against it again, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker, so he's concerned about the baby's safety and the risk of spreading diseases. He offers a compromise: wait a month before starting an alternative schedule. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive, and he's considering ending the relationship if she doesn't agree.\n\nThe author is asking if he's at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed but is now backtracking. The author has valid concerns as a healthcare worker. He's provided a compromise, but she's not budging. He's trying to protect the child's health, citing data and statistics. She's holding onto conspiracy theories about big pharma and vaccine ineffectiveness, despite evidence. The ultimatum is about his non-negotiable stance on vaccination, which he's clear about from the start.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important, but there are lines people won't cross. If both sides have valid but conflicting values, it's a hard situation. However, the author is standing his ground on something he considers important for the child's well-being, which is a parent's right. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But given her refusal to engage with factual data, maybe the author isn't wrong in setting a firm boundary.\n\nThe Hep B example is interesting. She argues the baby wouldn't contract it without her being positive, but the author is okay with the standard schedule. His compromise is a month delay. She's still against it. He's a healthcare worker, so his perspective is informed. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation, which he's tried to counter but she's not listening. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's about whether the author's actions are reasonable. Since he's given her options and she's not willing to budge, maybe he's not in the wrong. The question is whether an ultimatum is justified. If both sides can't meet in the middle, then the author has to decide his non-negotiables. Since the child's health is at stake, he's prioritizing that, which is a parent's responsibility. So B (not in the wrong) makes sense.\n"
