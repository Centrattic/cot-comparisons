Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. The author is a healthcare worker who's firm on vaccinating their future children, while the fianc\u00e9e is anti-vaccine, thinking they're a hoax and don't work. He proposed an alternative schedule, allowing a one-month delay before starting vaccines, but she's upset and called him manipulative. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly communicated his stance from the beginning of the relationship, which is important. He mentioned they had discussed alternative schedules before, so there was some prior agreement. Now, after she changed her position, he's setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is against vaccines, even after presented with data. She's not budging despite evidence from WHO and CDC. \n\nLegally, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children unless it's in the child's best interest, which can be a gray area. Ethically, vaccines are widely supported by the medical community as safe and effective. The author is prioritizing the child's health based on his professional knowledge. However, ultimatums in relationships can be stressful and might lead to conflict. \n\nBut the key here is that the author gave her an option to agree or walk away. He tried to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule, which is more than some might offer. The fianc\u00e9e wasn't committed to the original agreement. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise, but if one partner can't meet the other's non-negotiable terms, it's not necessarily wrong to set that boundary. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that giving an ultimatum is harsh, especially in a relationship. But considering the author's profession and the potential health risks involved, his stance is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept evidence could put the child at risk, which the author is trying to prevent. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the author is not in the wrong. He's protecting the child's health based on his expertise and has tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to compromise after knowing his position from the start complicates things. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
