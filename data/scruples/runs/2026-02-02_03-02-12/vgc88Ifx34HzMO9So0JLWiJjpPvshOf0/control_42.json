Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about vaccines and a fianc\u00e9e. The author mentions that they knew she was unvaccinated before proposing, and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. But now, after being engaged a month, she's more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risks and sets an ultimatum: the baby can't go more than a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a clear stance on vaccines and made his position known upfront. He's willing to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule but has a limit. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is now more adamant against vaccines, citing conspiracy theories and not accepting evidence presented to her. The author is trying to balance his values with her beliefs, but he's firm on the vaccine issue for the children.\n\nNow, the key points: Did the author cross a line by giving an ultimatum? Well, in a relationship, both partners should have mutual respect and be willing to compromise. However, when it comes to children's health, there's a personal belief vs. medical science debate. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds weight to his perspective. But ultimatums can be a sensitive area. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e agreed initially to work towards vaccination but now is refusing. The author's stance is based on his professional background and understanding of medical data. However, setting an ultimatum can be seen as a form of coercion if it's not flexible. The question is whether this ultimatum is acceptable in the context of their relationship and the importance of the issue.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author is standing up for his beliefs, which is his right, especially regarding his children's health. On the flip side, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and autonomy are also important. If the author's ultimatum is causing the relationship to break down, it might be seen as too rigid. But if the issue is about the children's well-being, some might side with the author.\n\nAnother angle: The author did give some flexibility by allowing a delayed schedule. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is not budging and is now accusing him of being manipulative. The author's main point is that he communicated his stance early and tried to meet in the middle. The fianc\u00e9e changing her mind after the engagement might indicate she wasn't truly committed to the compromise.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as reasonable given the importance of the topic. However, the way he presented the ultimatum could be the issue. But since they had prior discussions and he's given some ground, it's possible he's not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept evidence and her accusations might also play a role here.\n"
