Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 giving an ultimatum regarding vaccines. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker, which probably informs their strict stance on vaccines. They knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author's stance is that they can't accept an alternative schedule beyond one month. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and is upset about the ultimatum.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. They want to know if I agree. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is standing by their values and medical knowledge. On the other, the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured, which could be a red flag in a relationship. \n\nUltimatums in relationships can be tricky. While the author has a valid reason based on their profession and beliefs, forcing a decision might strain the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might indicate deeper issues, like fear or misinformation. The author tried to find a middle ground, but when that didn't work, they set a firm boundary. \n\nIs it right to walk away over this? If the author is willing to compromise but the fianc\u00e9e isn't, maybe the issue is more about differing values. The author is prioritizing the child's health, while the fianc\u00e9e's views might pose a risk. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as controlling. But considering the author's efforts to find a compromise, maybe it's justified.\n\nAnother angle: respecting each other's autonomy. The author isn't forcing vaccination but setting a limit. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination could be a dealbreaker. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for upholding their values. But if the ultimatum feels too harsh, maybe AITA applies. \n\nI think the key points are the author's profession, prior discussion, and the fianc\u00e9e's stance not changing despite evidence. The author's compromise was reasonable. So, likely the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
