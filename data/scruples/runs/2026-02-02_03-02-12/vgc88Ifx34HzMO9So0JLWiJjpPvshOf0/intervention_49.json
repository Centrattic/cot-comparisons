Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions they knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative vaccination schedules and agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. However, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is now more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth, and the author is setting a firm boundary: the baby can't go more than a month without starting some schedule. He's a healthcare worker, concerned about disease risks. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum, even though he had previously told her his stance on vaccination.\n\nSo the core issues here are about differing values and non-negotiables in a relationship. The author has a strong stance on vaccines, which he communicated early on. The fianc\u00e9e's position has shifted or perhaps she's becoming more adamant, but the author is now giving a clear ultimatum. \n\nThe key points to consider: Did he have a reasonable expectation based on prior discussions? Was the ultimatum a fair way to handle a non-negotiable issue? Is giving an ultimatum inherently wrong, or is it about the subject matter?\n\nThe author had already discussed his position before the engagement. He's a healthcare worker, so his concern is probably based on professional experience. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is opposing vaccines based on conspiracy theories and misinformation. The author is trying to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule but with a delay limit. \n\nIn relationships, when there's a fundamental disagreement on important issues like child health, it's common for one or both to set boundaries. The question is whether the ultimatum is justified. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate but is setting a limit on delaying. Since the fianc\u00e9e's stance has become more rigid, perhaps the author is protecting his values.\n\nBut some might argue that giving an ultimatum is harsh, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured. However, since they had prior discussions and this is a non-negotiable for the author, it's a matter of conflicting priorities. The author's actions are about protecting his children's health as per his beliefs, while the fianc\u00e9e's refusal is based on her own beliefs, which he finds unfounded.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he made his stance clear, tried to find a middle ground, and is now setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to be about the ultimatum itself rather than the content. The author is standing by his decision, which is reasonable given the potential health risks of not vaccinating. Therefore, answer B (Not in the wrong).\n"
