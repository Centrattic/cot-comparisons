Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's unvaccinated and the author is giving an ultimatum regarding their children's vaccination. \n\nFirst, the background: The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe following a different country's plan. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e brings up her strong opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants a modified schedule but not delaying beyond a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and the author is considering walking away.\n\nThe key points here are consent and ultimatums. The author set boundaries around vaccination for their children, which is a significant decision. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed but now is against it. The author is using an ultimatum to enforce their decision. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, ultimatums can be problematic because they can create pressure and conflict. But when it comes to medical decisions for children, parents often have to make tough choices. The author is prioritizing their beliefs about vaccination, which they see as necessary for their children's health. The fianc\u00e9e, however, has strong anti-vax beliefs, which the author has tried to address with data but to no avail.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the ethical standpoint. If you believe that both partners should compromise and the author is not allowing any flexibility, they might be at fault. But if you see the author as standing firm on a critical health issue for their future children, they might not be in the wrong. The author is also a healthcare worker, implying a professional understanding of the importance of vaccines.\n\nHowever, the ultimatum approach could be seen as extreme. The initial agreement was to follow a schedule, and now the fianc\u00e9e is against any vaccines, which is a shift. The author's response is to walk away if they can't reach an agreement. This could be justified if the author feels the children's health is at risk, but the fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured or manipulated.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. Both have valid perspectives based on their beliefs. The author is acting in what they believe is the best interest of their children, while the fianc\u00e9e's anti-vax stance is based on her own beliefs despite evidence. The author's use of an ultimatum might be necessary to protect their non-negotiable value, but it's also a relationship-ending decision. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their values and the children's health. But I can see arguments for both sides. However, given the scenario, B (the author is not in the wrong) seems more appropriate.\n"
