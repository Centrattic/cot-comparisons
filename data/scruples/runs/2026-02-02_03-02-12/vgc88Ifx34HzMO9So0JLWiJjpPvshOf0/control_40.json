Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The author mentions they discussed vaccines before getting engaged and agreed on a plan. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm and set an ultimatum of a one-month delay before starting vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the ultimatum is justified. The author has clear boundaries based on their profession and values. They tried to compromise with an alternative schedule but now the fianc\u00e9e is not on board anymore. The author is standing by their decision to protect the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance includes conspiracy theories and not accepting evidence. \n\nIs it wrong to set such a boundary? In relationships, differing values can lead to conflict. The author isn't forcing vaccination immediately but allows a delay. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination could put the child at risk. The author's stance is about health and safety, which is a common reason for ultimatums. The key here is whether the ultimatum crosses into being controlling or abusive. The author claims they discussed it before and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's backtracking. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction of calling it manipulative and abusive might be a misunderstanding of setting boundaries. However, the ultimatum could be seen as a deal-breaker. The author wants to protect the child, which is a parent's right. But some might argue that giving an ultimatum in a relationship over such a personal choice is extreme. However, given the health risks involved, the author's position might be justified. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary to protect their child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's willingness to change might be lacking, but the author has the right to prioritize their values. So the answer is B.\n"
