Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged to someone who is unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative vaccine schedules before the engagement, and both agreed the kids would get vaccinated but maybe follow a different schedule. Now, a month after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines than before. She's specifically against the Hep B vaccine at birth because she doesn't see how a baby could contract it, given their circumstances. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to start vaccinations within a month. He gives her an ultimatum: accept this compromise or it's over. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author made a compromise initially by suggesting an alternative schedule. Then, after the fianc\u00e9e becomes more resistant, he offers a slightly delayed schedule as the maximum he can accept. He's trying to meet her halfway but has a non-negotiable line. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is now refusing even that compromise, despite prior agreement. She's also bringing in conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and denying vaccine efficacy, despite evidence presented.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationship dynamics. In a relationship, both parties should respect each other's core values and non-negotiables. The author made it clear from the start that he wanted his children vaccinated. The fianc\u00e9e, at the start of the relationship, agreed to work towards that. Now, she's changing her stance, which might indicate she didn't fully commit to the initial agreement. The author is setting a boundary to protect his values and the child's health. \n\nBut ultimatums can be problematic. However, if both parties have discussed this and the author has made his compromise, it's about mutual respect. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction (calling him abusive) might be an overreaction. The author is not forcing her to vaccinate but is stating his limit. Given that vaccines are a medical necessity and the author is a healthcare worker, his stance is informed. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance seems to be based on misinformation, which the author has tried to address. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's standing by his values after a discussion and compromise, and the fianc\u00e9e is not willing to meet his minimum requirement, then he's not wrong. The key is whether he crossed a line in the ultimatum. Since he allowed for a delayed schedule, it's a reasonable compromise. She's the one not backing down. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
