Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged to someone who is against vaccines. They had discussed alternative schedules before, maybe following a different country's schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, gives an ultimatum that they can't vaccinate later than one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author feels they're standing their ground on something important, even though the fianc\u00e9e hasn't changed her stance despite evidence presented.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author made it clear from the start that they wanted their children vaccinated. The fianc\u00e9e agreed initially but is now backtracking. The author is offering a compromise with a delayed schedule but not completely against vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e is holding to anti-vax beliefs despite evidence.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for setting this ultimatum. On one hand, vaccines are a significant health decision, and the author is prioritizing their child's health. On the other hand, ultimatums can be seen as coercive. But the author had discussed this before proposing, so maybe they had a mutual understanding. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be the issue here. Also, the author is a healthcare worker, which might influence their perspective on medical decisions.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset about the ultimatum, calling it manipulative. But if the author had set boundaries from the beginning and the fianc\u00e9e agreed, then maybe the author isn't wrong for following through. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be a sensitive topic. But considering the health of the child is at stake, the author's stance could be justified.\n\nI should also think about consent in relationships. Both partners should agree on major decisions. If the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to compromise and the author can't accept her stance, the ultimatum might be necessary. The author isn't refusing vaccines entirely but is allowing a delayed schedule, which is a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept even that might be the problem.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complicated. The author is standing by their values and health beliefs, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e isn't meeting halfway, which could be her fault. The author isn't being entirely rigid; they're allowing an alternative schedule. The key is that they had prior discussions and agreed on some form of vaccination. The fianc\u00e9e's current stance might be a betrayal of that agreement.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary here. They had discussed it before, and the fianc\u00e9e is now changing her position without valid reasons, especially after evidence was presented. The author's ultimatum is a way to protect their child's health based on their profession and beliefs. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
