Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 giving an ultimatum regarding vaccines. The author proposed an alternative schedule but set a limit, and now the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew about the fianc\u00e9e's stance before proposing and they agreed on some compromise. Now the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, refusing even the Hep B vaccine at birth, which isn't necessary unless the mother is positive. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants the kids vaccinated. They set a one-month limit for a delayed schedule but not full refusal. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, accusing the author of being manipulative. The author is considering walking away.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong. Let me break it down. The author tried to find middle ground initially, adjusted their position to allow some delay but not refusal, and is standing by their decision. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has hardened, despite evidence presented. The author is prioritizing their values regarding children's health, which is a significant issue. Setting boundaries in a relationship, especially on such a critical matter, isn't uncommon. However, ultimatums can be seen as extreme. But given that they discussed this before marriage and the author has been clear, maybe it's justified. The question is whether giving an ultimatum over personal health beliefs is wrong. The author's reasoning is based on their own professional experience and the data they've reviewed, and they\u2019re unwilling to compromise further. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge is also a factor. The author isn't forcing vaccination but setting a limit. In relationships, major differences can lead to tough decisions. It's a complex situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
