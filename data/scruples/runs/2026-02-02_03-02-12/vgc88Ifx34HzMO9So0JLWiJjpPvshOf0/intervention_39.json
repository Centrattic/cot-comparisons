Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about vaccines and a fianc\u00e9e. The author is a healthcare worker and has been clear from the start that they want their kids vaccinated. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated and initially agreed to an alternative schedule. Now she's against vaccines more than ever, even bringing up the Hep B vaccine and questioning its necessity. The author gives an ultimatum: either they follow a modified schedule starting after a month, or the relationship ends. She's upset and calls him manipulative and abusive.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's standing by his principles, which he's been clear about from the beginning. Vaccines are a huge deal for him, and he's in a healthcare field, so he's probably very informed. He's also given her time to think and present counterarguments, but she's not budging. He's trying to find a middle ground by allowing a delayed start, which is a compromise. So maybe he's not being unreasonable.\n\nThen there's the fianc\u00e9e's side. She initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now is against them entirely. She's bringing up conspiracy theories about Big Pharma and saying vaccines don't work, despite evidence. That's a red flag. The author has tried to reason with her using data but she's not listening. If someone is set in their anti-vax beliefs despite overwhelming evidence, that's a serious issue, especially when it comes to children's health.\n\nNow, the ultimatum question. Is giving an ultimatum wrong? Relationships require compromise, but there are deal-breakers. If one person's values are non-negotiable, like healthcare decisions for kids, is it wrong to set a boundary? The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate right away but has given a time limit. Maybe he's justified in not wanting to compromise further because the health risks are significant. On the other hand, some might say that giving an ultimatum is harsh, but if the issue is that important, perhaps it's necessary.\n\nAlso, considering her reaction\u2014calling him manipulative and abusive\u2014maybe she's overreacting. If he's been clear from the start and she agreed, then the ultimatum is a consequence of her changing her stance. The key points are whether he's being reasonable in his stance and if the ultimatum is a fair response to her not honoring their prior agreement.\n\nIn terms of societal views, vaccines are widely supported by medical communities. Her stance is against scientific consensus, and the author is prioritizing evidence-based decisions. That might make the author's position more defensible. So, the answer could be B\u2014he's not in the wrong.\n"
