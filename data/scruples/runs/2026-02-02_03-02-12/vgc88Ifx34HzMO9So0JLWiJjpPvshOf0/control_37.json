Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9e being unvaccinated and now being against vaccinating their future children, even the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm on vaccines and has set a limit of a one-month delay before starting a schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main ethical and relational aspects here. The author knew about the fianc\u00e9e's stance before proposing and had agreed to an alternative schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's changed her stance entirely, despite prior agreement. The author is standing his ground, which leads to the ultimatum.\n\nThe key points are consent and compromise. The author had discussed and agreed on a plan with her, but now she's rejecting even the modified schedule. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to his stance on vaccine safety. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons (Big Pharma conspiracy, vaccines don't work) are based on misinformation, and the author has tried to counter with data without success.\n\nIn relationships, both parties should be able to compromise. However, if one party's non-negotiable beliefs conflict with the other's, it can lead to a breakup. Here, the author is setting a boundary based on his values, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be more about the ultimatum than the vaccine issue itself. But if she's unwilling to meet the minimum requirement the author set, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing his values regarding his children's health.\n\nAnother angle is whether giving an ultimatum is inherently wrong. In some contexts, yes, but when it's about non-negotiable issues (like the author's stance on vaccines), it's a matter of personal boundaries. The author isn't forcing vaccination but is stating his maximum flexibility. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after initial agreement complicates things. She might not have been serious about the compromise from the start.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a firm boundary. He's made a reasonable compromise, and she hasn't honored the prior agreement. So the answer would be B.\n"
