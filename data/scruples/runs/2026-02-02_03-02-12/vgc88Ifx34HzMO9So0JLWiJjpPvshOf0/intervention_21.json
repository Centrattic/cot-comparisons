Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 giving an ultimatum over vaccines. The author is a healthcare worker who proposed to his fianc\u00e9e after discussing alternative vaccine schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth, and he gives her an ultimatum: either the baby starts some alternative schedule within a month or they break up. She's upset and calls it manipulative or abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made the decision based on his professional background and the importance he places on vaccinations. He mentions that they had prior discussions and she agreed to some compromise. Now she's changed her stance, and he's unwilling to compromise further. He's a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to his stance, but he's using his position to enforce his views on the child's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially since he's a healthcare worker, which could make her feel uninformed or coerced. Vaccination decisions can be personal and emotional. The ultimatum might be seen as controlling, even if the author believes he's acting in the child's best interest. The key points are whether the ultimatum is manipulative and if it's acceptable to end a relationship over such a disagreement.\n\nThe author argues that they discussed it before, and she agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's not buying the data he provides. He's firm because of his career and the risks involved. But is it wrong to walk away? Maybe not, but is the ultimatum manipulative? The fianc\u00e9e's feelings are hurt because she's being given an ultimatum, even if the author is standing by his principles.\n\nAlso, the Hep B vaccine at birth is recommended for all newborns, which she's against without medical justification. The author's stance is based on CDC and WHO data, but she has her own beliefs. The author isn't forcing her to get vaccinated himself but is insisting on the child's vaccination, which is a parent's right. However, using the relationship as leverage might be seen as wrong, but if the author is standing by his convictions, it's a matter of differing values.\n\nIn summary, the author is in a tough spot. He's acting based on his profession and beliefs, but the ultimatum could be seen as controlling. However, since the decision affects the child's health, some might side with him. The answer depends on whether enforcing vaccination in a relationship is considered manipulative. Given that it's their child, both have a stake, but the author's approach might be seen as wrong if it's too forceful. But maybe it's not, since he's protecting the child's health. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because he's making a firm decision for the child's well-being, but it's a close call.\n"
