Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who set a firm boundary regarding vaccinating their future children, leading to a conflict with his fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, she's become more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to follow a schedule, with a maximum of waiting a month before starting an alternative schedule. He's given her an ultimatum, and she's accusing him of being manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nKey points to consider: Both parties had a prior agreement. The author has personal and professional reasons (healthcare job) to be cautious. He's not forcing her to vaccinate herself but is setting boundaries for their children. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has shifted, and she's not budging despite presented evidence. The author is willing to walk away if she doesn't accept his terms.\n\nPossible angles: Is setting a firm boundary acceptable in a relationship? Can differing values lead to breaking up? Is the author overstepping by making this a deal-breaker? Or is he standing by his principles?\n\nIn relationships, major differences in parenting choices can be deal-breakers. The author made his position clear upfront. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, which might be a problem. However, the ultimatum could be seen as harsh. But considering the author's profession and the health risks, maybe it's justified. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise despite evidence might make the author correct in his stance.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He communicated his stance, tried to find a middle ground, and when that's rejected, he's sticking to his principles. Her accusations of manipulation might be a defense mechanism. So the answer is B.\n"
