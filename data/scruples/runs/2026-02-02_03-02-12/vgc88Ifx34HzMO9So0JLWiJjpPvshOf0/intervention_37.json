Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e giving an ultimatum over vaccines. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from different countries. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated, but now she's against Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker, concerned about risk. He gives her an ultimatum: either agree to an alternative schedule (but only starting after one month) or he's leaving. She's upset, calling him manipulative.\n\nThe author argues that they had an agreement before marriage. She initially supported working towards vaccination but now refuses. He's tried to present data from WHO and CDC, but she doesn't believe it, claiming vaccines are a hoax. He's given his maximum flexibility (one month delay), and she's upset about the ultimatum.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's think about both sides. On one hand, the author is clear about his non-negotiable stance on vaccinating their children. He's tried to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule. On the other hand, he's giving an ultimatum, which can be seen as extreme. However, vaccines are a matter of public health and child welfare. The fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on misinformation, which the author has tried to counter with evidence but she's not changing her mind.\n\nIn relationships, major disagreements can lead to breaking up if unresolved. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate himself but is setting a boundary for their children. The fianc\u00e9e might argue that the ultimatum is controlling, but the author is protecting what he sees as the child's health. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children unless it's proven harmful. Vaccines are widely accepted as safe and effective. The author's approach, though firm, is within his rights. The fianc\u00e9e's rejection of vaccines based on conspiracy theories could be problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem justified, especially since he's made compromises and she's not budging despite evidence. He's trying to ensure the child's well-being, which is a valid concern. The ultimatum is a last resort after failed discussions. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
