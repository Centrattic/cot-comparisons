Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So, I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, possibly from another country, to ease her concerns about \"overloading the baby.\" They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated eventually. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a one-month delay as the maximum they can accept. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and is upset, leading the author to question if they're at fault.\n\nSo, key points: Both had prior discussions and an agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has become more rigid, even denying the effectiveness of vaccines and citing conspiracy theories. The author sets a firm line, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering moral responsibility. The author is advocating for vaccination, which is widely supported by medical institutions. They made compromises by allowing an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is not budging and is rejecting factual data. The author's ultimatum is based on their non-negotiable stance. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, giving an ultimatum can be seen as making a firm decision, but if both parties had prior agreement and the fianc\u00e9e is now violating that, the author's action is self-protective. However, ultimatums can be stressful. But in this case, the author is standing by their initial agreement and health concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any schedule might be the root issue. The author's actions are within their right if they set clear boundaries. \n\nBut maybe the author should have tried more dialogue? However, the scenario mentions they've discussed data and she's not receptive. The author is a healthcare worker, so their stance is informed. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition includes conspiracy theories, which are hard to reason with. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if both agreed on vaccines eventually, and the fianc\u00e9e is now reneging, the author is upholding the agreement. The ultimatum is a consequence of her not meeting the agreed terms. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're enforcing their non-negotiable line. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
