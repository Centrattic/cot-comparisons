Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe following a different country's approach. The fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, especially the Hep B one at birth, and the author is a healthcare worker concerned about risks. The author set a limit of waiting a month before starting an alternative schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e is now upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me consider both sides. Vaccination is a personal choice, but when it comes to children, parents often have to agree. The author tried to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule with a delay. However, the fianc\u00e9e's stance has hardened, and she's not budging despite evidence. The author is standing their ground, which could be seen as protecting the child's health, but giving an ultimatum might be seen as extreme.\n\nBut the author had previously agreed to some compromise. Now, they're setting a firm boundary because the fianc\u00e9e isn't cooperating. The fianc\u00e9e seems to have changed her position over time. The author is a healthcare worker, so their concerns about safety might be valid. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider the evidence and insistence on her beliefs might make the author's ultimatum necessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author is taking a firm stand on an important health issue, which they've been clear about from the start. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart complicates things. The author isn't forcing vaccination but setting a limit on delays. Since both parents need to agree on child-rearing decisions, the author's choice to walk away if they can't agree might be justified to protect the child's well-being. \n\nHowever, ultimatums can be seen as controlling. But given the context of prior discussions and the fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to compromise despite evidence, the author's stance might be reasonable. So, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
