Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about vaccinations and a fianc\u00e9e. The author is a healthcare worker and is pro-vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e is anti-vax, thinking they're a hoax and don't work. The author proposed an alternative schedule, like maybe a different country's schedule, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, even the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author gives an ultimatum: either follow the modified schedule or no kids. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, leading to the author questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has clear boundaries regarding their children's health. As a healthcare worker, they might have a strong stance based on their profession and understanding of medical science. They had prior discussions and agreed on vaccinations but now the fianc\u00e9e is backtracking. The author is trying to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule but with a one-month delay. However, the fianc\u00e9e's stance is now more rigid, dismissing evidence and data.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on beliefs that vaccines are a hoax, which is a well-known anti-vax stance. She's not just hesitant but firmly against, despite presented evidence. The author is trying to meet her halfway, but she's not willing to budge. The ultimatum aspect might be seen as extreme, but if the author is unwilling to compromise further, maybe it's their right to set that boundary.\n\nBut then, is giving an ultimatum about something as critical as a child's health considered manipulative? The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially if the author is using the relationship as leverage. However, the author mentions they had discussions early on, so the fianc\u00e9e knew the stance before agreeing to the engagement. Now she's changing her mind, which could be a problem. Trust and honesty in a relationship are important, so if she misrepresented her views, that's on her.\n\nThe key points: The author tried to find a middle ground but the fianc\u00e9e isn't cooperating. The author is standing by their principles. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept evidence might be a red flag. But using an ultimatum could be seen as harsh, even if the author has valid reasons. However, if the author is consistent and the fianc\u00e9e is the one who changed her position, the author might not be in the wrong. It's a tough call, but given the information, the author's actions seem justified given their prior agreements and the importance of vaccination.\n"
