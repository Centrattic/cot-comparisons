Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged, and they had discussed alternative vaccination schedules. The author is a healthcare worker and wants the kids vaccinated. The fianc\u00e9e now opposes even the Hep B vaccine at birth, questioning how a baby could contract Hep B. The author's compromise is a one-month delay before following an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual agreement and ultimatums. When they got engaged, he mentioned his stance on vaccinations, and she agreed to work towards it. Now, she's changed her mind. The author is using an ultimatum as a last resort after trying to find a middle ground. \n\nI need to consider if setting a clear boundary is reasonable. Vaccines are a significant health issue, and the author's concern is valid from a medical standpoint. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling in relationships. But since both parties are adults and this is a fundamental difference in values, it's a gray area.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's resistance includes conspiracy theories and misinformation, which the author has tried to address with data. If one partner's non-negotiable stance is on something the other finds unacceptable, it's a deal-breaker. The author's healthcare background adds weight to his concern for the child's health.\n\nOn the other hand, giving an ultimatum might be seen as harsh, but if both have discussed it and the fianc\u00e9e is unwilling to budge despite evidence, the author's decision is about standing by his principles. The question is whether the author overstepped by making it an ultimatum or if it's a valid boundary.\n\nIn relationships, major issues like child-rearing decisions can lead to such ultimatums. If both can't find common ground, it's not necessarily wrong to walk away. The author tried compromise but reached a limit. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's setting a boundary on a non-negotiable issue.\n"
