Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The question is whether to answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the proposal, and they discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would get vaccinated. Now, after being engaged a month, she's against it again, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and wants the baby to start vaccines within a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author feels they've given enough compromise, and since she's not budging, they had to set a limit.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's correct. Key factors here are mutual agreement, the author's stance on vaccines, the fianc\u00e9e changing her position, and the ultimatum.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's core values. The author made it clear from the start they want their kids vaccinated. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed but now is against it. The author is setting a boundary because they can't compromise further. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal might be based on misinformation, which the author has tried to address with data, but she's not buying it.\n\nThe ultimatum is a way to enforce the boundary. While ultimatums can be harsh, in this case, it's about a non-negotiable issue for the author. The author is prioritizing the child's health based on their profession and research. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is causing conflict, and the author is willing to walk away rather than let the child go unvaccinated.\n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on perspective. Some might say that giving an ultimatum is extreme, especially in a relationship. Others might argue that the author is standing up for their beliefs and the child's well-being, especially since the fianc\u00e9e's stance is based on unfounded beliefs. The author tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule) and that wasn't enough. The fianc\u00e9e's position is causing the breakdown.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their non-negotiables and trying to protect the child. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after agreeing initially, which complicates things. So the answer should be B.\n"
