Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about vaccines and an ultimatum. The author, who's a healthcare worker, is engaged to someone who is unvaccinated and strongly against vaccines. They had previously discussed alternative schedules, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author gives an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule starting after one month or face the end of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had the fianc\u00e9e's consent before proposing about following some schedule. Now she's changed her stance. The author is firm because of his healthcare background and the risks he's aware of. The fianc\u00e9e is anti-vax, citing conspiracy theories and not accepting evidence. The author feels he's compromised by allowing a deferred schedule but still wants his kids vaccinated. She feels pressured and it's causing conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. In relationships, major life decisions often require compromise. However, when there's a fundamental difference in values, like child-rearing, it's a big deal. The author tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule) but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. He's stating his non-negotiables because of his profession and beliefs. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But is it wrong? If the author is standing by his values and she's not willing to meet halfway, maybe he's not wrong. Alternatively, maybe he should have found a different way to handle it without an ultimatum.\n\nAnother angle: the fianc\u00e9e changed her position after agreeing before. The author had set boundaries early on, and she initially agreed. Now she's going back on that, which complicates things. The author's ultimatum is based on his non-negotiable stance, which he communicated from the start. So, if she knew his position and agreed, then she's the one who's changed, which might make the author's response justified.\n\nBut is it manipulative or abusive to give an ultimatum? It depends on context. If someone is making a deal-breaker issue and the other person is unwilling to compromise, it's not necessarily wrong. However, the way it's presented as an ultimatum without further discussion might be seen as harsh. But given the importance of child health and the author's profession, maybe it's understandable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because he's standing by his convictions and the fianc\u00e9e is the one who went back on prior agreements. However, the ultimatum approach could be questioned. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author isn't forcing her to vaccinate, just setting a boundary, it's not clear he's wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's resistance is based on misinformation, but that doesn't make the author wrong for wanting to protect his children.\n"
