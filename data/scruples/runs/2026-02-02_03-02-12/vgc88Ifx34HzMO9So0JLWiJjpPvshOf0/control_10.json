Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and the author setting an ultimatum regarding vaccinating their future children. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but on some schedule. Now, after being engaged a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risks and sets a maximum limit: no vaccines for the first month, then an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and the author is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether setting an ultimatum on such a significant issue is justified. The author has clear values about vaccinations, which they communicated early in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination but has since hardened her stance, despite evidence and data presented. The author is trying to balance their non-negotiable on vaccines with some flexibility (allowing a deferred start). \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Ultimatums in relationships are tricky. They can be seen as controlling, but when it comes to issues that involve health and safety of children, people might have non-negotiables. The author isn't refusing all vaccines but setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's position seems to be moving away from the initial agreement, and the author is standing their ground. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured and the author is being accused of being manipulative. The question is whether the ultimatum is reasonable. Since the author had previously discussed this and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it, the author might feel justified in setting a boundary. On the other hand, some might argue that giving an ultimatum is extreme, especially in a new engagement. \n\nBut given the importance of child health and the author's role in healthcare, their stance might be seen as reasonable. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's position isn't just about a preference but a firm rejection of vaccines despite evidence. The author's decision to set a firm limit could be seen as protecting their future child's health, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are standing by their values on a critical health issue after prior agreement, and the fianc\u00e9e's position is causing a conflict that the author is trying to resolve with a boundary.\n"
