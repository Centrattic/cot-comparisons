Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e's stance on vaccines before getting engaged and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more against it, specifically the Hep B vaccine at birth, which the author finds hard to understand given her lack of exposure to medical facilities. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a maximum of a one-month delay before starting the schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, claiming it's manipulative and abusive, even though the author had previously laid out their stance.\n\nI should consider the context. The author has tried discussing with data from WHO and CDC, but she's not budging. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate but is setting a boundary to protect the child. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is strong, including conspiracy theories about Big Pharma. The author is in a position where they can't compromise further without violating their own values. \n\nIs the ultimatum justified? The author isn't forcing her but is stating their own limits. They made it clear from the start about their stance on vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e agreed to work towards it but now isn't. The author is a healthcare worker, so their concern about disease risks is informed. The Hep B example is tricky because the vaccine is given at birth for a reason, even if the risk is low. The author isn't asking for the current schedule but a slight delay, which the fianc\u00e9e might agree to. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author is being too rigid. But considering the fianc\u00e9e's stance, perhaps the author is within their rights to set a boundary. Also, the author is prioritizing the child's health based on their profession. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have to make compromises in a relationship. The author has tried to meet halfway with an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might mean she's unwilling to negotiate, leading the author to set an ultimatum. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they've made their position clear and tried to compromise, but the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to agree on a modified plan leaves the author to set a firm boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
