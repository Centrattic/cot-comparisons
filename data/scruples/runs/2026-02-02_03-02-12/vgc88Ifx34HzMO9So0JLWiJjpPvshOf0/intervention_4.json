Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 giving an ultimatum regarding vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e was already on board with vaccinations before they got engaged, but now she's changed her mind and is against them. The author proposed a modified schedule, but she's not buying it, and now she's upset he's willing to end the relationship over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a healthcare worker who prioritizes vaccines, which is understandable. They had agreed on a compromise before, but she's now pulling back. The author's stance is that they can't go further than a one-month delay. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive for giving ultimatums. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, they were clear about their stance from the start. They mentioned their position about vaccination when they started the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e agreed then, but now she's changed. The author is trying to maintain their boundary, which is reasonable if they're firm on this issue. \n\nBut ultimatums can be a heavy approach. Even though they were clear before, giving a one-month window as a final decision might be seen as harsh. However, considering the importance of health decisions for their future children, especially in the role of a healthcare worker, their concern is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might be due to misinformation or a shift in her beliefs. The author has tried to provide data, but she's not swayed. The ultimatum is about maintaining their own values and protecting their child's health, which is a parent's right. \n\nIn relationships, ultimatums are often frowned upon because they can be controlling, but if both parties had discussed this before and the author is standing by their non-negotiable, it's more about personal boundaries. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate; they're allowing a modified schedule but not beyond a month. \n\nI think the author is justified in setting this boundary, especially given their profession and the earlier agreement. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
