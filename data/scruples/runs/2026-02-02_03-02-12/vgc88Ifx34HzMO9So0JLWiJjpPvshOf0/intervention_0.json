Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is about vaccines and an ultimatum given by the fianc\u00e9. The user wrote a Reddit-style question where they're asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for setting a hard line on vaccines with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9 was unvaccinated before the proposal. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated but on some schedule. Now, after a month, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth because she doesn't think the baby would contract it. The author is a healthcare worker concerned about risks and set an ultimatum: the baby can't start an alternative schedule after one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author wants to stick with vaccines, shows her data, but she's still against them, thinking it's a conspiracy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants to know the opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author made it clear from the start that they wanted their kids vaccinated. They compromised by allowing an alternative schedule but set a limit. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is being anti-vax, citing conspiracy theories despite evidence. The author is a healthcare worker, so their stance is informed. The ultimatum is a final decision point. \n\nIs the author justified in setting a firm line? If both had agreed on some form of vaccination, but the fianc\u00e9e is backing out now, the author might be within their rights to set a boundary. However, ultimatums can be seen as manipulative, especially if they're used to control. But in this case, the author is standing by their prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her position after agreeing to work towards it, which could be a problem. \n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's arguments are based on misinformation. The author tried to provide data but she's not budging. The author is concerned about public health and safety, given their job. The ultimatum is to protect the baby's health, which is a parent's role. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author didn't leave enough room for discussion, but they already tried to compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept evidence might be a deal-breaker. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's stance seems reasonable. They tried to meet halfway but now the fianc\u00e9e isn't following through. The author is protecting their child's health, which is a valid concern. The ultimatum is a firm but necessary line in this context. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
