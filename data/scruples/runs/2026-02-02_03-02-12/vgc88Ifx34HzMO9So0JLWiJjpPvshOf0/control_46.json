Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before they got engaged, and they had discussed alternative schedules. Now she's more against vaccines than before. The author is a healthcare worker and sets a limit of delaying the first month, which the fianc\u00e9e is upset about, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author proposed an alternative schedule (like some countries' schedules) to accommodate her concerns. Now she's against vaccines entirely, even rejecting the Hep B vaccine at birth despite the low likelihood of contracting it. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their stance on vaccines. They tried to compromise but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. The author is giving an ultimatum because they can't compromise further, and the fianc\u00e9e is upset.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, but in some places, there might be laws requiring certain vaccines. The author might be within their rights to set that boundary. However, emotionally, ultimatums can be seen as manipulative or controlling, even if the person is trying to protect the child. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being overridden. But the author is standing by their principles, especially since they're a healthcare worker who understands the risks. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider evidence and data could indicate she's not in the right place to compromise.\n\nThe main ethical question is about respecting each other's values. The author tried to find a middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to meet halfway. The author is prioritizing their child's health based on their profession and knowledge. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be contentious. But if they've already discussed this before getting engaged and she agreed to work towards the vaccination plan, her sudden change might give the author the right to set boundaries. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author tried to compromise and the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging despite evidence, maybe the author isn't wrong. But relationships require mutual respect. If the author is using an ultimatum to force a decision without considering other options, that could be seen as wrong. However, in this case, the author is a healthcare worker, so their stance is informed. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong (B) because they tried to compromise, have a valid reason based on their profession, and the fianc\u00e9e is not engaging constructively. However, the approach of an ultimatum might be harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable boundary for the author to set.\n"
