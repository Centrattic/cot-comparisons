Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author is giving her an ultimatum. The author mentions they discussed alternative schedules before getting engaged, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against it. The author is a healthcare worker and wants the kids vaccinated, giving a one-month window before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They had prior discussions about the vaccine schedule, so they knew her stance. They proposed a compromise, allowing an alternative schedule but with a one-month delay. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is now more resistant, even after presented with data from WHO and CDC. The author is setting a boundary because they can't accept the risk of not vaccinating, which makes sense given their healthcare background.\n\nBut is the ultimatum wrong? It's a big decision. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on their profession and evidence. However, ultimatums in relationships can be tricky. They might come across as controlling, especially if one partner is pressuring the other on a personal belief. Yet, the author has set their limit, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9e might feel her autonomy is being challenged, but the author is standing firm on their principles.\n\nI need to check if the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9e's views while standing by their own. They tried negotiating before, but she's not budging. The author's stance is based on health data and their professional experience, which are valid points. The problem is whether giving an ultimatum is fair. In relationships, major decisions like child-rearing can require compromise, but if one partner is unwilling to compromise, the other's boundary is justified.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've made an effort to find a middle ground, but when the other side refuses to budge despite evidence, setting a firm boundary is reasonable. The key here is that they tried to meet halfway, but the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to consider the evidence makes the ultimatum a necessary step for the author. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
