Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after giving an ultimatum about vaccinating their child. \n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before engagement. They discussed alternative schedules, eventually agreeing the kids would be vaccinated. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e becomes more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, sets a deadline of one month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e now calls it manipulative and abusive.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent, communication, and ultimatums. The author had discussed their stance on vaccines from the start of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses. The author is trying to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule but is firm on not accepting no vaccines.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is standing by their non-negotiable, which is vaccination for their children. They provided a compromise (delayed schedule), but the fianc\u00e9e isn't budging. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their concern about risks. However, giving an ultimatum can strain a relationship. The question is whether the ultimatum is justified.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's about personal values and boundaries. If the author has made their position clear and the fianc\u00e9e is now backtracking, the author might not be at fault. However, the ultimatum could be seen as too harsh if the fianc\u00e9e's resistance is based on deeply held beliefs, even if unfounded. But the author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a valid concern.\n\nI think the key here is that the author had prior discussions and tried to find a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might be the main issue. The author isn't forcing vaccines but is setting a boundary. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
