Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccinating their future children, and the author gave an ultimatum regarding a delayed vaccination schedule. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions they discussed alternative schedules before getting engaged, and the fianc\u00e9e wanted to avoid \"overloading the baby.\" They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B from being in a medical facility, even though the fianc\u00e9e has never been in one.\n\nThe author gives an ultimatum: either follow a modified schedule starting after a month or not have kids. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author feels they're not wrong because they set boundaries based on their beliefs and the fianc\u00e9e hasn't changed her stance despite evidence.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether setting a non-negotiable boundary on such a significant decision (child's health) is acceptable. The author acknowledges they discussed it before, so there was prior agreement. However, the fianc\u00e9e's stance has hardened, and the author's ultimatum is a firm line. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting personal autonomy is important. However, when it comes to children, parents do have a responsibility to make decisions in the child's best interest. The author is prioritizing their belief in vaccines as necessary for the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal is based on misinformation, which the author has tried to address with data.\n\nBut the ultimatum aspect could be problematic. Ending a relationship over a fundamental disagreement is a big decision. However, the author mentions not wanting to end the relationship but can't compromise further. It's a matter of whether the author is justified in setting such a strict boundary. \n\nIn some perspectives, if both parties were aware of each other's positions before commitment, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for sticking to their principles. However, others might argue that the ultimatum is extreme and that more dialogue or counseling could be attempted first. \n\nGiven that the fianc\u00e9e's views have shifted post-engagement and the author has tried to meet her halfway with a delayed schedule, the author's stance might be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, based on the information provided, the author's actions are within their right to set boundaries for their child's health, especially when the other party isn't budging despite evidence. So, the answer is B.\n"
