Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me try to break it down.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker who proposed to his fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They had previously discussed alternative vaccine schedules, maybe from another country. Now, after a month of engagement, she's bringing up her strong opposition again, especially the Hep B vaccine. He's set a boundary: the baby can't wait more than a month before starting a modified schedule. She's reacting strongly, calling him manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum. He's confused because he thought she was on board before, and he's using data from WHO and CDC to argue, but she's not budging, still believing vaccines are a conspiracy and don't work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made it clear from the start that he's pro-vaccine and expects his children to be vaccinated. He's in a healthcare field, so he's probably aware of the risks of not vaccinating, especially in a baby. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, maybe because she's more committed now or didn't realize the seriousness. But the author had a prior agreement, even if it was flexible. Now he's setting a firm boundary, which she's opposing.\n\nIs it wrong to set a boundary on such an important health issue? The Hep B vaccine at birth is standard because it can prevent transmission from mother to child. If the mother is negative, the risk is lower, but there are still possible exposures. The author's concern is valid, especially as a healthcare worker. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to even consider the modified schedule is a deal-breaker for him. He's not asking for the exact same schedule he follows, but a compromise with a one-month delay. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is now saying he's manipulative, which is a heavy accusation. However, if he's been clear about his stance and she agreed before, but is reverting now, maybe that's her being inconsistent. The author's reasoning is about protecting the child's health, which is a responsible approach. The fact that she's using conspiracy theories and isn't swayed by evidence might make the author feel that any compromise would put the child at risk. \n\nThe question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If he gave a reasonable ultimatum based on prior discussions and his professional knowledge, and she's not respecting that, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. On the other hand, ultimatums can sometimes be seen as extreme, but given the topic, it's a critical health decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to protect his future child's health, which is a primary parental responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to compromise on a matter that's been discussed might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
