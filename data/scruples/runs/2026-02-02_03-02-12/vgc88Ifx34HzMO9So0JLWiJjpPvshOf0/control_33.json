Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the engagement. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to align with her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of transmitting diseases. He gave her an ultimatum: either the baby starts vaccinations by one month or not at all. She's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. The author is confused because she was on board before and now isn't, even after he provided data from WHO and CDC.\n\nSo the key points here are the ultimatum and the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance. The author is firm on vaccinations but allowed a slightly delayed schedule. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is now against vaccines entirely, despite prior agreement. The author's reasoning is based on his healthcare background and the data he's presented. The fianc\u00e9e's concerns seem to be rooted in distrust of big pharma and the belief that vaccines don't work.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to walk away over this. On one hand, the author is standing by his convictions, which are important for child-rearing. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as extreme, especially if it's about a partner's deeply held beliefs. Even if the author has valid reasons, the ultimatum might be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of the fianc\u00e9e's views, especially if she hasn't changed her mind despite his efforts to reason with her.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e did agree before to work towards vaccination, so the author might feel justified in holding his ground. However, the shift from an alternative schedule to an ultimatum with a one-month window could be seen as a breaking point. The author's actions depend on the balance between respecting the partner's beliefs and protecting the child's health. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because he set clear boundaries based on his professional and personal values. Yet, the ultimatum approach might be too harsh, especially in a relationship where both should ideally compromise. But since the fianc\u00e9e's stance is now extreme and not just a scheduling difference, the author's decision to set a firm line could be seen as necessary for the child's well-being. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
