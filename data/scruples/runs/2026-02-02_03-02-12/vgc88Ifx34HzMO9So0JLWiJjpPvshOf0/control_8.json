Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker who proposed to their fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They had previously discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to accommodate her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, she's becoming more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author's stance is that they can't go beyond a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. They're worried about the risk of diseases and believe vaccines are safe and effective. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive, and her views are more anti-vaccine, citing Big Pharma conspiracies and denial of vaccine efficacy despite data presented.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for giving an ultimatum over vaccines? Answer A or B.\n\nFirst, consider the author's position. They made their stance clear from the beginning of the relationship. They're a healthcare worker, which might inform their trust in vaccines. They offered a compromise (alternative schedule with a one-month delay) as their maximum concession. They're standing by their decision, which is important for their own values and what they believe is best for the children's health. \n\nNow the fianc\u00e9e's position: She was initially on board with working towards vaccination but now is adamantly against it, even when presented with evidence. She's accused the author of being manipulative. Her views are rooted in distrust of pharmaceutical companies and claims that vaccines don't work, despite evidence to the contrary. This is a significant shift in her stance, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect in a relationship and the right to make medical decisions. The author is trying to protect the child's health based on their professional experience and data. The fianc\u00e9e, however, has changed her position, which the author finds problematic. \n\nIn terms of ultimatums, it's common in relationships to have non-negotiables, especially regarding children's health. The author isn't forcing vaccination but setting a boundary: either follow the alternative schedule within a month or the relationship can't continue. This is a serious decision, but if both can't agree on a fundamental aspect like child care, it's a valid reason to consider the relationship's future.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is using a medical decision as a deal-breaker, which could be seen as extreme. But given the importance of vaccines and the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence, the author is protecting their values and the child's well-being. The fianc\u00e9e's shift from being open to working on it to being completely against it might also indicate a lack of commitment to the agreement they had.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They made their position clear, offered a compromise, and are standing by their decision when the other party isn't willing to meet them halfway. The fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation and abuse might be a reaction to the ultimatum, but the author's stance is based on their own values and professional judgment.\n"
