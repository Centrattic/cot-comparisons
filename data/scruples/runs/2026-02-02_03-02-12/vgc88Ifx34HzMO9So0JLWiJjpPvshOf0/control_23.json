Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the engagement, and they had discussed alternative schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. The author, who works in healthcare, is concerned about the risk and has set a limit of delaying vaccines by a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calls him manipulative, and they're at odds.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: they had prior discussions and agreed on some vaccination plan. The fianc\u00e9e's stance has changed, and the author is standing firm, leading to a potential breakup. The author cites data and sources, but she's not budging. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting this ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned they discussed alternative schedules beforehand, so there was some agreement. Now the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed. The author is a healthcare worker, so their concerns about health risks are valid. The ultimatum is a compromise, allowing a delay of one month. But the fianc\u00e9e sees this as manipulation. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to set boundaries regarding their children's health? In many cases, parents have the right to make medical decisions for their children, and if there's a significant disagreement, it's a major issue. However, the ultimatum could be seen as extreme if it leads to breaking the engagement. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's views have changed, and she's not engaging with evidence, which complicates things. \n\nThe author isn't forcing vaccinations but is setting a limit. The fianc\u00e9e's accusations of manipulation might be a red flag, but the author's stance is based on prior agreements. It's a tough call. Some might say the author is justified in standing by their values, especially regarding health. Others might think the ultimatum is too harsh. However, given the prior discussions and the importance of the issue, it's a matter of differing values leading to a difficult decision. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they made an attempt to compromise, provided evidence, and the fianc\u00e9e's position has shifted. The author is making a hard decision based on their convictions and the prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is now more rigid, and the author is protecting their stance. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
