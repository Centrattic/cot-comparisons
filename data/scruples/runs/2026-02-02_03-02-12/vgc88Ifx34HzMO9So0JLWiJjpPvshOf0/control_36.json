Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe a different country's schedule, so she wouldn't feel like the baby is \"overloaded.\" They agreed the kids would get vaccinated. Now, a month into engagement, she's more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. He's a healthcare worker, concerned about risks of not vaccinating, and wants the baby to start on an alternative schedule but not delay more than a month. She thinks he's being manipulative and abusive. She was previously okay with working towards vaccinations but now isn't. He cites data from WHO and CDC, she still refuses, claims vaccines are a hoax. He gives an ultimatum, and she's upset. The question is AITA (Am I the Asshole)?\n\nSo the main issue is whether giving an ultimatum is the wrong approach. Let's break it down. Both are entering into a partnership where they need to agree on major issues like child-rearing. Vaccination is a significant medical decision. The author made his stance clear from the start, tried to compromise, but she's now backtracking. He's a healthcare worker, so he's in a position where he has more knowledge or trust in medical science. She has strong anti-vax beliefs, perhaps based on misinformation. He's now setting a boundary, which is understandable. But is it wrong to give an ultimatum?\n\nOn one hand, ultimatums can be seen as extreme, especially in a relationship. But in this context, if they can't agree on a fundamental issue that affects the child's health, maybe it's necessary. The author tried to find a middle ground. He's not saying no vaccines, just a delay. The fianc\u00e9e's position is that vaccines don't work and are a hoax, which is a serious stance. If she's unwilling to budge despite evidence, maybe the author is justified in setting a limit. However, some might argue that forcing someone into an ultimatum is controlling, especially if she's under pressure. But given that they're planning to have children, their views on vaccination are crucial. The author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a parent's duty. If she's not willing to meet his minimum requirement, breaking up might be the only option. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's standing by his principles and health beliefs. The answer is B.\n"
