Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9e and vaccines. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but maybe not the exact schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is bringing up Hep B vaccine again, being very against it. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and set an ultimatum: the baby can't go unvaccinated for more than a month before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset and calls it manipulative and abusive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about consent and compromise. The author had already discussed this before the engagement and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed. Now, she's changing her stance. The author is standing firm because they can't accept the risk, especially given their profession. But is setting an ultimatum wrong? Well, in relationships, major decisions like vaccination often require mutual agreement. The author tried to find a middle ground by allowing a deferred schedule, which is a common alternative for some parents. But the fianc\u00e9e is now unwilling to budge, even after presented with data. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. They made their position clear and tried to meet halfway. But if the fianc\u00e9e is not compromising and the author is uncomfortable with the risk, giving an ultimatum might be a way to enforce their boundaries. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, even if the topic is serious. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially after the engagement. But the author's stance is based on their professional understanding and health concerns. \n\nI need to consider whether the author is being reasonable. Allowing a one-month delay isn't too extreme, especially since some alternative schedules start later. The Hep B vaccine at birth is standard, but maybe the author's reasoning is that if the baby isn't exposed to medical facilities, maybe the Hep B can be delayed. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to even consider that, given the data, might indicate she's not open to negotiation. \n\nSo, the author tried to compromise, made their boundaries clear, and when the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to meet them halfway, they set an ultimatum to protect their future child's health. While ultimatums can be harsh, if the issue is non-negotiable for the author, it's a way to maintain their values. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction of calling it manipulative and abusive might be an overreaction, but the author's position could be defensible. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They had prior discussions, tried to find a middle ground, and are standing by their decision to protect their child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's unwillingness to compromise after the engagement might leave the author in a morally right place to set that ultimatum.\n"
