Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nFrom the story, the fianc\u00e9 knew his partner was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to make her more comfortable. They agreed the kids would get vaccinated. Now, after a month, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants to start vaccines within a month. He sets an ultimatum: either they follow a modified schedule starting after a month or they part ways. She's upset, calling him manipulative, and claims he's being abusive with ultimatums. She also previously agreed to work towards vaccination but now is against it.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and the nature of the ultimatum. The author proposed a compromise (alternative schedule) which she now refuses. He's giving a final deadline, which she finds too harsh. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, vaccines are a personal choice, and forcing someone to accept a specific schedule might infringe on their autonomy. However, the author is a healthcare worker, which might inform his stance. He's setting boundaries based on his values, which is understandable. However, giving an ultimatum about a major life decision like parenting could be seen as extreme, especially if it leads to breaking off the relationship. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e had agreed before, changed her mind, and isn't budging despite evidence. The author feels he's compromising by allowing a delayed schedule. Is it fair to walk away over a deal that was agreed upon but now refused? It's possible that both sides have valid reasons, but the ultimatum aspect might be where the author crosses a line, even if he's standing by his principles. Relationships require mutual respect, and pressuring someone on a non-negotiable issue could be problematic. But if the issue is fundamental (like child's health), it's also a matter of personal values.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because he's protecting his values and health concerns, but some might argue A (in the wrong) for the ultimatum. However, given the context that they had prior agreement and she's backtracking, the author's stance could be seen as justified. The key is whether the ultimatum is reasonable. Since he's given a modified schedule and she's still against it, maybe he's in the right.\n"
