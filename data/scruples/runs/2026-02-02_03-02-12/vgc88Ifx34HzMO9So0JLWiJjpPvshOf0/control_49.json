Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's against vaccines, and the author is giving her an ultimatum. \n\nFirst, the background: They discussed alternative schedules before proposing, and she was okay with eventually vaccinating the kids. Now, after getting engaged, she's more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and has a limit of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. She's upset and called him manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the ultimatum makes the author at fault. Let's break it down. \n\nThe author had prior discussions about vaccines, and both agreed on some form of vaccination. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is becoming more anti-vax, even with data presented. The author is setting a boundary based on his values and profession. But is that ultimatum unreasonable?\n\nOn one hand, ultimatums in relationships can be problematic because they force a decision and risk ending the relationship. But in this case, the author is standing by a previously agreed-upon compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's position has shifted, and the author is adjusting his limit because he can't budge further. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's stance includes conspiracy theories (Big Pharma) and dismissing scientific evidence. The author tried to reason with data but she's not budging. The ultimatum here is about the author's non-negotiable line regarding his children's health. \n\nIs it wrong to have this boundary? If the author's stance is based on protecting the child's health and his own professional understanding, and he's already made concessions (like the one-month delay), then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, using an ultimatum can be seen as harsh, especially in a relationship. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e was initially on board and is now backtracking. The author is trying to enforce a prior agreement. The key is whether the ultimatum is a breach of trust or a necessary stand. The author felt they had an agreement, so enforcing it might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author used manipulation or coercion in the ultimatum, that could be problematic. But the story says he presented his maximum limit and left the choice to her. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is more about the ultimatum itself rather than the content. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is trying to uphold a previously made agreement, even as the partner's position has changed. Since the author's compromise was already significant (alternative schedule with a delay), his boundary seems reasonable. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
