Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker who's engaged to someone who is unvaccinated. They had discussed alternative vaccination schedules before getting engaged, and the fianc\u00e9e was okay with the kids getting vaccinated. Now, after a month of being engaged, she's becoming more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author sets an ultimatum that the baby can't go more than a month without starting a schedule, and the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is a healthcare worker and has provided evidence from WHO and CDC, but she's not budging, still thinking vaccines are a hoax. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent and communication. The author mentioned that they had discussed this before proposing, and the fianc\u00e9e agreed to follow some sort of schedule. Now, she's changing her stance. Did she actually agree to the specific terms the author is now setting? The author says they agreed on the kids being vaccinated, but maybe the fianc\u00e9e thought there would be more flexibility. The author is now giving an ultimatum, which can be seen as a form of coercion, even if based on his beliefs.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's position is that vaccines are a hoax and don't work. The author is trying to compromise by allowing a delayed start but not total refusal. However, the fianc\u00e9e is not budging. The author is using his profession to back his stance, and the fianc\u00e9e is using conspiracy theories. The author is trying to protect the child's health, but is it right to force the fianc\u00e9e to comply?\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. The author might believe he's doing the right thing for their child, but giving an ultimatum can be seen as controlling, especially in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being disregarded. Even if the author had prior discussions, changing her stance now could be due to new information or deeper convictions she didn't realize she had. But the author is pushing back, which could strain the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The author's actions are based on his professional and personal beliefs, which are valid. However, giving an ultimatum in a relationship can be seen as manipulative unless both parties are on the same page. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, especially if she's not comfortable with the compromise. The author's approach is firm, and while his intentions are to protect the child, the method might be the problem.\n\nIt's also important to consider the impact on the relationship. If the author is willing to walk away, that's a significant decision. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her views are being dismissed. Even if the author's stance is informed, relationships require compromise. The author's ultimatum might not account for the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to protect the child's health, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept scientific evidence complicates things. But in a relationship, both partners need to find a middle ground. The author's compromise (one month delay) is a middle ground, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't accepting it. The author's actions might be justified in his view, but the method of presenting an ultimatum could be the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's motives are to protect the child, the way he's handling the situation by giving an ultimatum could be seen as wrong because it's pressuring the fianc\u00e9e and not allowing for further discussion. The key is whether the ultimatum is respectful and based on mutual agreement, which might not be the case here. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I need to check again.\n\nWait, but the author had prior discussions and set boundaries. If the fianc\u00e9e agreed before and is now backing out, the author is trying to uphold that agreement. However, if the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind, the author's ultimatum is a response to that. It's a tough call. The author is in a position of power due to his profession, and using that to pressure might not be right. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings of being manipulated are valid. So maybe the answer is A. But some might argue B because he's protecting the child's health. Hmm.\n"
