Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. They want an answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and had agreed to vaccinate the kids, maybe on an alternative schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets an ultimatum: the baby can't be unvaccinated beyond one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. So, I need to consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had prior agreement, are in a healthcare field, and are prioritizing health based on scientific consensus. They tried to compromise with an alternative schedule but have a limit. They're not forcing immediate vaccination but allowing a one-month delay. Their stance is about protecting the child's health and adhering to medical advice.\n\nOn the fianc\u00e9e's side, she might feel pressured, especially since the author is in a medical profession and could be seen as using that authority. Her views on vaccines being a \"big ploy\" and questioning their efficacy might stem from personal beliefs or misinformation she's encountered. The ultimatum could feel like a sudden shift, even if they had discussed it before. The term \"abusive\" is strong, which might be part of the conflict.\n\nNow, considering ethical and relationship dynamics, is it wrong to have a non-negotiable issue in a relationship? If both parties had initial agreement but one changes stance, the author is setting boundaries based on their values. However, the ultimatum approach might be seen as lacking flexibility, especially if the fianc\u00e9e's views are deeply held. The key here is whether the author overstepped by making it an all-or-nothing deal. \n\nIn many cases, major life decisions like vaccines for children require mutual agreement. If the author had discussed this beforehand and the fianc\u00e9e agreed, then the author isn't entirely wrong. But relationships require compromise. However, if the fianc\u00e9e is now unwilling to budge despite prior agreement, the author might be justified in standing their ground. \n\nThe author's actions are based on protecting their child's health, using evidence and their professional background. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be due to feeling cornered, which is a common issue in ultimatums. But the author isn't forcing immediate vaccination; they\u2019re allowing a one-month delay. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They had prior discussions and set a boundary, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart complicates things. The author isn't being coercive beyond stating their limit, which could be seen as necessary for their own peace of mind. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made a compromise and set a limit, and the fianc\u00e9e's reaction is extreme, but the author's stance is based on informed decisions and prior agreements.\n"
