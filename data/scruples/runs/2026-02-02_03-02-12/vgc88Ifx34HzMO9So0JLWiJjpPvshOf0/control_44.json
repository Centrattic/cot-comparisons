Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's unvaccinated and against vaccinating their future children. The author, who's a healthcare worker, set a boundary by giving an ultimatum: either the kids follow some vaccination schedule or they end the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they had prior discussions about alternative vaccination schedules, and they came to an agreement. However, after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e became more opposed, specifically against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have a professional stake in vaccines, and they're concerned about the risk of the baby contracting diseases. They've tried to present data and information to counter the fianc\u00e9e's anti-vax views but she remains unconvinced. The author set a clear boundary, giving her a month to start an alternative schedule, and now she's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author has a strong stance on vaccines based on their profession and research. They tried to compromise before, allowing an alternative schedule. Now they're setting a firm boundary because they can't compromise further. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's opposition to vaccines is based on anti-vax sentiments, which are not supported by scientific evidence. The author is standing by their principles, which might be seen as right because they're acting in the best interest of the child's health. However, ultimatums in relationships can be seen as extreme, especially if they lead to a breakup. But given the context that they discussed this before engagement and she agreed to work towards vaccination, maybe the author isn't wrong for following through.\n\nAnother angle is consent and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author did mention their stance from the beginning, and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed. Now she's changed her mind. The author is trying to honor their initial agreement but also their own values. If the fianc\u00e9e is not willing to meet the author's minimum requirement, the author isn't wrong to take a firm stance. However, the method of presenting it as an ultimatum might be harsh, but given the circumstances, it's a personal decision.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept evidence-based information and her conspiracy theories about vaccines could be a red flag for the author. The author is protecting the child's health based on their professional knowledge. So, while ultimatums can be seen as extreme, in this case, the author is trying to uphold their values and the child's well-being, which might justify their stance.\n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had prior discussions, tried to compromise, and are acting based on their professional and health knowledge. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to accept evidence-based reasoning is the main issue, not the author's firm stance. The author is trying to protect the child from preventable diseases, which is a valid concern.\n"
