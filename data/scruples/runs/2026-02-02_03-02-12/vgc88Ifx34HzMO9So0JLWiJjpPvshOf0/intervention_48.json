Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e regarding vaccines. The background is that they discussed alternative schedules before proposing, and the fianc\u00e9e is now against vaccines altogether, leading the author to set a limit of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their agreement. They had a prior understanding that the children would be vaccinated, possibly following a different schedule. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance, which the author sees as a betrayal of their initial agreement. The author is in a healthcare profession, which adds weight to their stance on vaccines, emphasizing safety and risk minimization.\n\nThe author's ultimatum is to either accept the one-month delay or face the end of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and abusive. The key points here are whether setting such a firm boundary is reasonable and if it constitutes manipulation or abuse. The author argues that they've tried to accommodate by allowing an alternative schedule with a delay, but the fianc\u00e9e has become more entrenched in her opposition. The author's healthcare background likely influences their perception of the importance of timely vaccinations, especially Hep B at birth, which they see as a necessary precaution.\n\nNow, considering the principles of relationships, both parties should have mutual respect and compromise. The author was clear about their stance from the start, which the fianc\u00e9e agreed to. However, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after engagement complicates things. The author's decision to set a firm boundary might be seen as necessary to protect their values, but the method of an ultimatum could be perceived as controlling or harsh. However, the user believes the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to assess that.\n\nThe main issue is whether the ultimatum is a valid way to enforce a pre-arranged agreement. If both parties agreed to vaccinate but now one is backing out, the author is trying to uphold the original agreement. The author's stance is based on public health data and their professional knowledge, which contrasts with the fianc\u00e9e's anti-vaccine beliefs. The author's healthcare job gives them a perspective that prioritizes safety, which might be difficult to reconcile with the fianc\u00e9e's views.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule) but the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to even accept the Hep B vaccine at birth, despite the low risk of transmission, is a deal-breaker. The author's decision to walk away could be seen as protecting their values and the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e feels the ultimatum is manipulative, but the author is standing by their initial agreement. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong because they tried to compromise and are upholding their initial agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's shift in stance after engagement is the complicating factor. The ultimatum is a way to respect their own boundaries and values, which is reasonable in a committed relationship.\n"
