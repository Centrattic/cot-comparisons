Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author is giving her an ultimatum to either agree to a delayed vaccination schedule or face the possibility of the relationship ending. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that they had discussed alternative schedules before proposing, and both agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, even bringing up the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants the baby to start the schedule within a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe author provided a compromise by allowing a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. But the fianc\u00e9e is still not on board and is now upset. The author feels they've given enough ground and that the fianc\u00e9e is being unreasonable despite evidence from WHO and CDC. The fianc\u00e9e's arguments include believing vaccines are a hoax and a big pharma ploy, which the author has countered with data but to no avail.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Ultimatums in relationships can be touchy. On one hand, the author is standing by their non-negotiable stance on vaccinating the kids, which is important for their health and the baby's. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, especially if the compromise was already made. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, even if the author is trying to find a middle ground.\n\nBut the author did mention that they had prior agreement and that the fianc\u00e9e initially understood their stance. The compromise here (one-month delay) seems like a reasonable middle ground. However, the fianc\u00e9e's position has become more rigid post-engagement, which could be a red flag. The author's concerns about health and safety are valid, especially given their profession. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's ultimatum is justified. Since they had prior discussions and the fianc\u00e9e is now backtracking despite evidence, the author feels they can't compromise further. The ultimatum is about making a decision on the baby's health, which is a significant issue. However, ending a relationship over a compromise might be seen as extreme, but if both parties can't meet in the middle, it's a tough spot.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't forcing the issue; they're setting boundaries based on their values and the baby's well-being. The fianc\u00e9e is the one who is unwilling to budge. The author's actions could be seen as standing up for their beliefs and the child's health, which is a valid reason. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
