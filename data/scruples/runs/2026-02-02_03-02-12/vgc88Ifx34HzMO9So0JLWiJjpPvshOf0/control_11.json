Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a healthcare worker who is engaged to someone who is unvaccinated. They had agreed before getting engaged that their kids would be vaccinated, maybe on an alternative schedule. Now, after a month of being engaged, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed to vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author sets an ultimatum: the baby can have a delayed schedule but must start within a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author is a healthcare worker, so they have a professional background in health, which might inform their stance. They also mention discussing data from WHO and CDC, but the fianc\u00e9e isn't convinced, citing conspiracy theories about Big Pharma.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for giving an ultimatum. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The author had prior discussions about vaccines before the engagement, and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards a vaccinated schedule. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance, which complicates things. The author is offering a compromise (delayed but eventual vaccination) but is firm on not accepting no vaccines at all.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is trying to protect the child's health based on their professional experience. Vaccines are widely supported by medical science for preventing diseases. The fianc\u00e9e's beliefs are against scientific consensus, possibly influenced by misinformation. The author is setting a boundary, which is important in a relationship, especially regarding a child's health. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme, but if both parties can't meet in the middle on something critical, it's a necessary step.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The fianc\u00e9e is upset and claims manipulation. However, the author had discussed their stance from the start and is now firming up the boundary. The author isn't forcing vaccines but is willing to accept a modified schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on unfounded beliefs, which the author has tried to address with facts without success. The author's position seems reasonable given their commitment to the child's health and their professional background. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
