Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9e who is anti-vax, and the author setting an ultimatum about vaccinating their future children.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew she was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. Now, after a month of engagement, she's becoming more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of her not being vaccinated bringing diseases to the baby. He offered a one-month deferment before starting an alternative schedule, but she's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive for giving an ultimatum.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's standing by his decision to vaccinate his children, which is a personal and important health choice. On the other hand, he's giving an ultimatum, which can be seen as extreme. But he did set this condition before the engagement, and she had agreed to work towards it. Now she's changed her stance, and he's trying to set boundaries based on his profession and values.\n\nI should consider if the ultimatum is reasonable. The author is giving some flexibility with a one-month deferment and alternative schedules, which might be a compromise. However, ultimatums in relationships can be contentious, especially when it comes to medical decisions. But vaccines are a matter of public health and personal ethics, so the author has a valid concern. Has he been respectful in his approach? He mentioned discussing it and offering a compromise, which seems reasonable. She's now being resistant without changing her core beliefs, which he's tried to address with evidence.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and understanding play a role. If she agreed before, then changed her mind, the author might be within his rights to hold firm. The fact that she's calling him abusive for an ultimatum is a strong accusation. But if he's presented this as a non-negotiable part of the relationship, perhaps it's his way of maintaining his values.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication he crossed a line. The one-month deferment is a compromise, not a complete refusal. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition is based on misinformation, so the author has a right to prioritize his stance. However, the ultimatum approach might be seen as too harsh. But given the context of prior agreement and her backtracking, maybe it's justified.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting a boundary based on his beliefs and profession, having already made compromises. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart and refusal to budge despite evidence could make the author's stance reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
