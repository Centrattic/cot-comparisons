Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's against vaccines and the author is giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed on some sort of schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to Hep B at birth. The author is a healthcare worker concerned about safety and is willing to wait a month before starting vaccinations. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, and claims the author is being controlling. The author doesn't want to end the relationship but is firm on vaccination.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct.\n\nI should consider autonomy and shared decision-making in relationships. While it's important to respect each other's views, the author is making a decision based on their beliefs and profession. Vaccinations are a personal choice, but the author is setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge might be a deal-breaker for the author. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. The author's reasoning is based on health data and professional experience, but imposing their will without flexibility could be problematic. They did try to compromise by allowing a delayed schedule. The fianc\u00e9e's changing stance and denial of vaccine effectiveness might be a red flag for the author. In relationships, both parties should be able to respect each other's core values. If vaccination is a non-negotiable for the author, giving an ultimatum isn't inherently wrong, but it's a big decision. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction of calling it manipulative could be valid if the author didn't consider her reasons. However, the author did mention they had prior discussions and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed to work towards it. Now, her stance is rigid, which might justify the author's decision to set a boundary. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're asserting their values and health priorities, but there's nuance. I need to weigh the balance between respecting personal choice and the author's right to make medical decisions for their child. Ultimately, the decision to walk away is tough, but if vaccination is a core value, the author isn't wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
