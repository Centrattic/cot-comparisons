Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the Rant is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the engagement. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease her concerns about \"overloading the baby's body.\" They agreed the kids would be vaccinated on some schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author is a healthcare worker and insists on starting vaccines within a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. The author is conflicted but stands by their decision, citing data and public health information.\n\nThe key points here are the ultimatum, communication, and mutual respect in the relationship. The author gave an ultimatum that if the fianc\u00e9e couldn't agree to the delayed schedule, they would walk away. The fianc\u00e9e feels this is manipulative, even though she was previously on board with working towards vaccination.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author has strong personal and professional reasons for wanting vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e has changed her stance, despite previous agreement. The ultimatum is a significant decision, especially in a relationship. But is the author in the wrong? \n\nIt depends on how the ultimatum was presented and whether there was mutual respect. If the author had explored all options, communicated clearly, and the fianc\u00e9e refused to budge despite evidence, then the author might not be at fault. However, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, even if the topic is important. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be a problem, but the author's response (walk away) is a major consequence. \n\nIn relationships, major decisions often require compromise. The author's stance is firm, but vaccines are a medical decision with public health implications. The fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement vs. current opposition could be a red flag for the author. But the ultimatum's harshness might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing health, but the way they handled it (ultimatum) might be problematic. However, given the fianc\u00e9e's inflexibility and misinformation, perhaps the author had to draw a line. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is standing by their non-negotiable stance on a critical health issue. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage with evidence complicates things. But the ultimatum could be seen as extreme. Hmm.\n"
