Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e about vaccines. The situation is about whether to vaccinate their future children. The author is a healthcare worker, which probably gives them a strong stance on vaccines. They had previously discussed alternative schedules, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines than before, even calling them a hoax.\n\nThe author set a limit: the baby can't go more than a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author argues they've tried presenting data but she's not budging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Vaccines are a personal choice, but parents have a responsibility to protect their children. The author is prioritizing the child's health based on medical evidence. They didn't force immediate full vaccination but allowed a deferred alternative. The fianc\u00e9e's opposition includes conspiracy theories, which are not supported by science. \n\nThe ultimatum might be seen as extreme, but if someone refuses all vaccines, then setting a boundary is reasonable. The author is trying to balance their values with the relationship. They're not forcing immediate vaccination but giving a window. \n\nHowever, ultimatums can be stressful in relationships. The fianc\u00e9e might feel pressured, but the author is standing by their principles. The key is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. Given the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any vaccination, the author's decision to walk away if she doesn't agree seems justified. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a decision based on their values and the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's position is against medical consensus. The answer should be B.\n"
