Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9e who is unvaccinated and now opposing vaccines, leading to an ultimatum from the author.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they had prior discussions about an alternative vaccine schedule before proposing. They agree that the kids should be vaccinated but on a modified schedule. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, sets a limit: the child can't go more than a month without starting vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e reacts strongly, calling it manipulative and abusive, and the author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement in a relationship. They had an initial agreement, but now there's a shift in the fianc\u00e9e's stance. The author's position is based on their professional background and concern for the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is now firm against vaccines, citing conspiracy theories and distrust in their effectiveness despite being presented with evidence.\n\nIn relationships, both parties should respect each other's values and boundaries. The author is standing by their non-negotiable boundary regarding vaccines, which is a significant issue in terms of child health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge, despite prior agreement and data, might indicate a lack of commitment to the compromise they initially made. The ultimatum is presented as a final attempt to resolve the conflict, and the author is willing to walk away if the fianc\u00e9e doesn't accept it. This is seen as a last resort, not an act of manipulation but a defense of their core values.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't being unreasonable. They've made compromises and provided alternatives. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction seems to stem from a fundamental disagreement that wasn't recognized before the engagement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
