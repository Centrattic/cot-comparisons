Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is anti-vaccine and the author is giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. They agreed to vaccinate the kids but with some flexibility. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a one-month delay as the maximum. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive. The author is conflicted but stands by their decision, citing their own health background and data.\n\nSo, the core issue is about conflicting values. The author has a firm stance on vaccines, which is backed by medical consensus. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has strong anti-vax beliefs despite evidence. The author gives an ultimatum because they can't compromise further. \n\nNow, considering right or wrong. The author isn't forcing the vaccines immediately; they offered a one-month delay. They also tried to find middle ground before, like alternative schedules. The fianc\u00e9e's position seems to have hardened. The author is standing by their principles regarding their child's health. \n\nIs it wrong to set a boundary? The author is in a position where they can't accept any compromise beyond a month. If the fianc\u00e9e can't agree, then the author is walking away. This is a personal decision and doesn't involve coercion beyond stating their limits. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction\u2014calling it manipulative\u2014is subjective. The author isn't forcing the vaccines, just setting a limit. The author has tried presenting data, which the fianc\u00e9e dismissed. In such cases, respecting each other's boundaries is key. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a firm boundary based on their values and profession. They made compromises initially. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to meet even that adjusted boundary is her choice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
