Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author mentions that before proposing, they discussed alternative vaccine schedules, and both agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. But now, after a month of being engaged, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth, which the author is okay with because the risk is low but they don't want any risk. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about possible exposure from others. They set an ultimatum that the baby can't go unvaccinated for more than a month, and the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive. The author is conflicted about ending the relationship but stands by their position.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is trying to protect their future children's health, which is a parent's responsibility. They had prior discussions and set boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, has changed her stance or hasn't truly committed to the agreement. The author is firm on their stance, which is about health, while the fianc\u00e9e is against vaccines entirely. \n\nIn relationships, major life decisions like healthcare for children are significant. If both parties can't agree on such a critical issue, it's reasonable for the author to set a boundary. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as harsh. But given that the author has tried to compromise by allowing a slightly delayed schedule, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's arguments are based on misinformation, and the author has tried to provide evidence but she's not swayed. In such cases, when one partner's beliefs directly impact the health of the children, it's a valid concern. The author isn't forcing her to take the vaccines but is setting a limit on how much they can compromise. \n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that the author is being rigid and not allowing any flexibility. However, the author is already offering an alternative schedule, which is a middle ground. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge, despite prior agreement, might indicate a lack of commitment. \n\nSo, considering that the author is trying to protect the child's health, has discussed the matter, and is setting a firm boundary that's as flexible as possible, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are making a decision based on their values and professional experience. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be overblown, but the author's stance is about the child's well-being. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
