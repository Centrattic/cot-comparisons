Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author proposed to his fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to make her feel better about not \"overloading\" the baby. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated but with some schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risk, even if the baby's exposure is unlikely. He sets an ultimatum: the baby can't go more than a month without starting some schedule. She's now upset, calling him manipulative and abusive, and the author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key here is whether setting a clear boundary on vaccine schedules for their future child is unreasonable. The author has tried to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule but sets a limit. The fianc\u00e9e, however, seems firmly anti-vax, even after presented with data. The author is a healthcare worker, which might influence his stance. He's not forcing her to vaccinate the child immediately but drawing a line at the first month. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e claims the vaccines are a hoax and that they don't work, despite evidence to the contrary. The author has tried to reason with her using data from WHO and CDC, but she remains unconvinced. The ultimatum is a way for the author to protect his stance on vaccination, which he's clear about from the start. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if both partners have the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their children's health, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as extreme. But considering the context\u2014prior discussions, her changing stance, and the author's professional background\u2014it might be a reasonable decision. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might stem from feeling pressured, but the author's position is about his non-negotiable belief in vaccination. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (no), because the author is standing by his decision based on prior agreements and his professional concerns. However, some might argue that the ultimatum is too harsh. But given the information, the author tried to find a middle ground and now is setting a boundary.\n"
