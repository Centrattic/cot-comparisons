Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong after giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. The author wants their children to be vaccinated but is open to an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e initially agreed but later became more anti-vax, leading the author to set a strict limit. Now the fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated and the author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a healthcare worker and is clear about their stance from the start. They offered a compromise with a delayed schedule but the fianc\u00e9e is resistant, even after evidence. The author's ultimatum is about their non-negotiable line. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured, calling it manipulative.\n\nLegally, there's no law here, but in terms of ethics and relationships. Giving an ultimatum is a personal choice. If both parties can't agree on something as critical as child healthcare, maybe it's reasonable to walk away. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as coercive, especially if the other party feels they have no choice. The author mentions they discussed it before, so maybe the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind. But the author is standing firm on their principles.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's resistance is based on misinformation (like Big Pharma conspiracy, vaccines not working). The author tried to educate her, but she's not swayed. In such cases, differing core values can lead to relationship strain. The author's ultimatum is about protecting their children's health, which is a valid concern. But forcing a decision on a partner might be seen as controlling. However, when it comes to a child's well-being, people have different thresholds for compromise.\n\nIn relationships, it's important both partners agree on major issues. If one can't budge, it's a sign of incompatibility. The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9e to vaccinate; they're setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels the ultimatum removes her choice. But the author is prioritizing health over the relationship, which is their right. However, the approach might be seen as extreme. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their values, but the method (ultimatum) could be harsh. However, given the importance of vaccination in healthcare, especially with the author's profession, their stance is understandable. So the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
