Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (who is the fianc\u00e9 in the situation) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum regarding vaccines. \n\nSo, the background: They're engaged, and the fianc\u00e9e is unvaccinated. Before proposing, they discussed alternative schedules. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month, she's bringing up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine for newborns. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of the baby getting Hep B, even though the fianc\u00e9e has no medical history that would put the baby at risk. The author's compromise is to delay the first month of vaccines, but she's upset, calling him manipulative and abusive. He's stood by his stance despite her anti-vax views, citing data and evidence, but she's not changing her mind.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects. The author is setting a boundary based on his values and health concerns. He's a healthcare worker, so he has professional training and understanding. He's given her prior notice about his stance on vaccines, and they had an agreement. Now she's changed her position, which he finds inconsistent. Giving an ultimatum is a tough call, but it's his choice to prioritize his beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, she's feeling manipulated and abused. The term \"ultimatum\" can be seen as controlling, but it's about a core issue for him. The key here is mutual respect and whether the ultimatum was the right approach. However, in relationships, making such a big decision without considering the partner's feelings might be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut from the author's perspective, he's tried to find a middle ground (alternative schedule, one-month delay), and when she won't budge, he's protecting his values. The fianc\u00e9e's views are based on misinformation (anti-vax beliefs, conspiracy theories), which he's tried to counter with data. Yet she's not listening. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a complex issue. Legally, parents have rights to make medical decisions for their children, but in a relationship, both partners have to agree on major issues. The author is asserting his stance, but the ultimatum might be seen as harsh. However, if one partner is unwilling to compromise on something as critical as a child's health, the other's decision to set a firm boundary isn't without justification. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing by his convictions after prior discussions and tried to find a compromise. However, the method of an ultimatum might have been a point of contention. But given the situation, his actions are defensible. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage with evidence is also a factor. So, the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
