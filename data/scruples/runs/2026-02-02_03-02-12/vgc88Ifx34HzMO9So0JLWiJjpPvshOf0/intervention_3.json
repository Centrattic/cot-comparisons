Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the background: The author knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe from another country, to ease the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed on following some schedule. Then, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e brings up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, sets a boundary: the baby can't go a month without starting some schedule. The fianc\u00e9e now calls this manipulative and abusive, even though they had discussed this before entering the relationship.\n\nThe author's stance is about protecting the child's health, citing medical data and their own profession. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is anti-vax, citing conspiracy theories and refusing to accept evidence. The author gives an ultimatum, which the fianc\u00e9e is upset about, leading to the question of whether the author is at fault.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (author in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The key points here are consent in a relationship and respecting boundaries. The author tried to compromise by allowing an alternative schedule but has limits. The fianc\u00e9e's position is against medical consensus and has not changed despite evidence. The author's ultimatum is based on their non-negotiable stance on vaccination, which they've communicated from the start.\n\nThe author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9e to vaccinate herself but is setting a boundary for their children's health. In relationships, both parties have the right to their beliefs, but when those beliefs threaten the health of others, especially children, some boundaries become necessary. The author's actions seem to be about protecting the child, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might stem from feeling pressured, but the author has the right to prioritize the child's well-being. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. So the answer would be B.\n"
