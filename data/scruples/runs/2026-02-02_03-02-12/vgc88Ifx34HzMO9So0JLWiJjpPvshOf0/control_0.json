Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author proposed to their fianc\u00e9e knowing she was unvaccinated. They had discussed an alternative schedule from another country as a compromise. Now, after a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, even the Hep B vaccine at birth, which the author thinks is necessary. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of disease and has set a limit of deferring vaccines for a month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive for the ultimatum. She had agreed before but is now backing out. The author wants to stay married but can't compromise further.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let me think about both sides. On one hand, the author is standing by their decision to vaccinate, which is a personal health choice. They had a prior agreement but now the fianc\u00e9e's stance has hardened. The author is trying to find a middle ground by allowing a one-month delay. On the other hand, giving an ultimatum might be seen as extreme, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured. The author mentions that the fianc\u00e9e previously agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses, which complicates things.\n\nBut vaccines are a major health issue. The author is concerned about disease risks, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence might be seen as unreasonable. However, forcing a partner to follow a specific medical decision can be a point of contention. The question is about whether the ultimatum is fair. Since the author had discussed this before and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, the author is trying to set a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e might feel manipulated, but the author's stance is also about protecting their future children's health.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about mutual respect and agreement. If both parties can't agree, the author has the right to set boundaries they're comfortable with. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept any compromise might mean she's not in agreement with the author's values, which are important for their family. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They tried to find a middle ground but when that's not accepted, they have the right to decide their own limits. Therefore, answer B.\n"
