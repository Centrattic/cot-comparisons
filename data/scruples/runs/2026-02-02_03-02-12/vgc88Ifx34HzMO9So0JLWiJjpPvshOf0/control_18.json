Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 knew his fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They discussed alternative schedules, and he agreed to follow a modified plan. Now, after a month, she's more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. He's a healthcare worker, so his concern about risks is legitimate. He sets a limit: the baby can't start any alternative schedule beyond one month. She's upset, calling him manipulative, and they're at an impasse.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the ultimatum. The fianc\u00e9 had communicated his stance early on\u2014vaccinated children. She agreed then. Now, after a month, she's changed her position, and he's giving her an ultimatum to either accept his terms or leave. The question is whether this ultimatum makes him wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, this involves personal beliefs and health decisions. He's standing by his convictions, which he made clear from the start. He's given her a compromise (alternative schedule after a month), which he's willing to walk away from if she doesn't accept. She, on the other hand, feels coerced and is now against vaccines more than before, despite evidence presented.\n\nLegally, there's no law against this, but ethically, it's a matter of mutual respect. The problem here is whether one person's non-negotiable stance is justified. Vaccines are a personal choice, but when it comes to children, parents have to make decisions together. If they can't agree, an ultimatum might be the only resolution. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as manipulative, especially in a relationship.\n\nBut the fianc\u00e9 had already set his boundaries early. He's tried to compromise. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart after agreeing initially complicates things. She's now not just disagreeing but firmly against vaccines, which he can't accept. The ultimatum is his last attempt to resolve the conflict. So, is he wrong? It's a tough call. In relationships, ultimatums are often a red flag, but when it comes to health decisions that affect children, some people might say his stance is justified.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the ultimatum is seen as a necessary stand on health vs. being controlling. Since he's made his position clear from the start and tried to find a middle ground, but she's not budging, his actions are more about protecting his values. However, the way he frames it as a take-it-or-leave-it might be seen as harsh. Still, given the context, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
