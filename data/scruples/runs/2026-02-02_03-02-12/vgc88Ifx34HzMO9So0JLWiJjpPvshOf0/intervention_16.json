Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum to their fianc\u00e9e over vaccines. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author proposed after knowing their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated. They had prior discussions about alternative schedules, and both agreed that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after being engaged a month, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, specifically the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and sets a limit of a one-month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the author manipulative and abusive because of the ultimatum. The author wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nI should consider the key points. The author did discuss vaccines beforehand and the fianc\u00e9e initially agreed. Now, she's changed her stance. The author is trying to set boundaries based on his profession and beliefs, but she's not budging. The ultimatum is a last resort because he's reached his limit. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, ultimatums are often seen as harsh. But in this case, the author has tried to find a compromise (alternative schedule with a delay). However, the fianc\u00e9e's position has shifted, and she's not responsive to evidence. The author's job involves healthcare, so his concern about exposing the baby to diseases is valid. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If both sides had equal validity, maybe, but vaccines are supported by extensive scientific evidence. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal is based on misinformation (e.g., dismissing big pharma, downplaying effectiveness). The author is protecting his children's health, which is a parent's right. \n\nBut relationships require mutual respect and negotiation. The author gave a compromise but now is setting a strict line. However, the fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement and the current ultimatum could be seen as a breach of trust if she wasn't serious before. \n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for his values. On the other, the ultimatum might be the breaking point. But given the health risks and the fianc\u00e9e's refusal to budge despite evidence, the author is trying to protect the child. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, and he's trying to make a decision for the child's well-being. The ultimatum is a last resort after compromise attempts. So, answer B.\n"
