Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who's against vaccines, and the author, who's a healthcare worker, gives an ultimatum. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they discussed alternative schedules before getting engaged. The fianc\u00e9e was okay with following a different schedule, maybe from another country. They agreed that the kids would be vaccinated eventually but maybe not right away. Now, after a month of engagement, she's more opposed, especially to the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author wants to wait a month before starting any schedule, but the fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling the ultimatum manipulative and abusive. The author is a healthcare worker and emphasizes their stance on vaccinations, while the fianc\u00e9e's views haven't changed and she's skeptical of vaccines' efficacy and motives.\n\nThe key points here are consent and ultimatums in a relationship. The author set a boundary, but the fianc\u00e9e feels pressured. The author argues that they discussed this before, but maybe the fianc\u00e9e misunderstood or the author didn't clearly set the ultimatum earlier. The author is a healthcare worker, so their concern about risk might be valid. However, giving an ultimatum after the engagement might be seen as using their position of authority or knowledge to pressure. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's views are based on misinformation, but the author's approach might not be the healthiest way to handle differing values. Relationships require mutual respect, and forcing a decision on something as significant as vaccination could be seen as controlling. The author might not be wrong in wanting their children vaccinated, but the method of using an ultimatum could be problematic. It's a tough call, but the answer hinges on whether the ultimatum is seen as reasonable given prior discussions.\n"
