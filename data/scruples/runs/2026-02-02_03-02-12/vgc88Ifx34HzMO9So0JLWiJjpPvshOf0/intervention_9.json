Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author has given an ultimatum regarding the vaccination of their future children.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author knew the fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing and discussed alternative schedules with her. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated, maybe following a different country's schedule. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, being a healthcare worker, is concerned about the risk of bringing diseases home and other people around the child. So, he sets a maximum of a one-month delay before starting the vaccination schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative and abusive, claiming vaccines are a hoax and don't work, despite the author showing her data from WHO and CDC. The author is considering walking away if she doesn't agree.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. From a public health perspective, vaccines are crucial for preventing diseases. The Hep B at birth is recommended to prevent transmission from the mother, but the fianc\u00e9e doesn't have any risk factors. However, the author is concerned about other possible exposures. The fianc\u00e9e's stance seems to be rooted in anti-vaccine beliefs, which the author has tried to counter with evidence but she's not budging. \n\nThe author is setting a boundary here, which is their right when it comes to their children's health. But is it an ultimatum? Ultimatums can be seen as controlling, but in this context, it's about a non-negotiable health issue. The author is clear about their stance and the consequences if it's not met. The fianc\u00e9e had previously agreed to work towards vaccination but is now backtracking. \n\nI should consider if the author is overstepping. The author isn't forcing her to vaccinate themselves but is asserting the right to vaccinate the children as per their agreement. The ultimatum is about their own children's healthcare, not her personal choices unless she has a medical condition that would make vaccination necessary for her. But the main issue is the children. The author is a healthcare worker, which adds credibility to their position, but that doesn't mean the fianc\u00e9e is wrong in her beliefs, just that they are conflicting. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction is intense, calling it abusive. Ultimatums in relationships can be problematic, but the topic here is about a significant health decision. The author tried to find a middle ground with an alternative schedule but now has a firm line. Is it fair for the author to have this boundary? I think so, especially since they had prior discussions. The fianc\u00e9e's change of heart might be causing the conflict. The author isn't forcing her to take the vaccine but is making a decision about their child's health. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They are prioritizing their children's health based on their beliefs and profession. The fianc\u00e9e is the one who isn't following through on the agreement they made. So the answer should be B.\n"
