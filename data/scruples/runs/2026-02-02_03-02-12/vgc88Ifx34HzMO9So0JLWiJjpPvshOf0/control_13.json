Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after setting an ultimatum about vaccines with their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the background: The fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before the proposal. They had discussed alternative schedules but agreed the kids would be vaccinated. Now, a month into the engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially the Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is giving an ultimatum to start an alternative schedule after one month. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative or abusive.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they made their stance clear from the start. They tried to find a compromise but now have set a hard line because they can't accept no vaccines. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, is now resistant and not buying the data presented. The author is worried about the risk of not vaccinating, especially in a healthcare environment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, ultimatums in relationships can be tough. The author did try to find a middle ground initially, but when the fianc\u00e9e's stance hardened, they set a limit. But the key here is whether the author overstepped. Vaccines are a personal choice, but the author's concern is about the child's health and their professional environment. They are using their own values and risk assessment, which is valid. However, giving an ultimatum can strain a relationship. The question is whether the author was right to do so given the prior agreements and their own non-negotiable stance.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e changed her position, which the author might not have anticipated. The author's response is to set a firm boundary, which some might see as necessary if they can't compromise. Others might argue that relationships require flexibility. But since the author had already warned about this being non-negotiable from the start, maybe the ultimatum is justified. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is emotional, but the author is standing by their principles. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of values. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their beliefs and the child's health based on their professional background. They made an effort to compromise but found the fianc\u00e9e's position too rigid. So the answer is B.\n"
