Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentioned they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had prior discussions about alternative vaccination schedules, possibly from another country, to ease her concerns about overloading the baby. They agreed the kids would be vaccinated somehow. Then, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e brings up her opposition again, especially against the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, being a healthcare worker, wants the baby to start vaccinations within a month, not wanting the risk of disease transmission. He gives her an ultimatum, leading her to accuse him of manipulation and abuse.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement on vaccination, the fianc\u00e9e's change of heart, and the ultimatum given. The author argues that they discussed this before, and she agreed to work towards vaccination. Now she's backing out, and he's firm because of his healthcare background and the data he's presented. She, on the other hand, is adamant that vaccines are a hoax and not effective, despite evidence.\n\nThe question is whether the author's ultimatum makes him \"in the wrong.\" From a moral standpoint, the author is standing by his non-negotiable stance because of his beliefs and profession. He's given a compromise (alternative schedule with a one-month delay) which he considers his maximum. The fianc\u00e9e feels pressured, but the author maintains they had an agreement. \n\nConsidering autonomy and respect in relationships, ultimatums can be seen as controlling. However, the author is trying to protect the child's health based on his professional knowledge. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to accept vaccines despite evidence might make her the one in the wrong, but the ultimatum could still be seen as harsh. However, since the author had prior discussion and compromise, and the fianc\u00e9e is now backing out, the author's position might be more defensible. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, vaccines are a contentious issue. While the author's stance is supported by medical consensus, the fianc\u00e9e's skepticism is a personal belief. The ultimatum is a personal choice in a relationship, and if both parties can't meet in the middle, it's a tough spot. The author isn't forcing her; he's stating his boundaries, which is not inherently wrong. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's upholding his agreement and trying to make a rational decision for the child's health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal is rooted in her beliefs despite evidence, which complicates things, but the author isn't forcing her beyond his own limits.\n"
