Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for giving a vaccination ultimatum to his fianc\u00e9e. The author explains that they had previously agreed on following some vaccination schedule, but now the fianc\u00e9e is more against it, especially the Hep B vaccine at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is firm on not having unvaccinated children due to health risks, and the fianc\u00e9e feels manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was aware of her stance before proposing and they had discussed alternative schedules. Now she's backing out. The author's reasoning is based on medical evidence and public health data, which he's in a position to understand as a healthcare worker. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is anti-vax, citing conspiracy theories and rejecting vaccines despite presented evidence. The author is setting a boundary, which he feels is necessary for their future children's health.\n\nEthically, parents have the right to make healthcare decisions for their children, and vaccination is a significant public health measure. The author is standing by his values, which are supported by scientific consensus. However, relationships require compromise. The question is whether imposing a non-negotiable condition is fair, especially when the other person has changed their stance after being in a committed relationship.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the ultimatum is seen as inflexible and if he hadn't considered her changing her mind despite prior agreements. But given the health implications and the fianc\u00e9e's current refusal to budge despite evidence, the author's stance could be justified. The key point is that both parties had agreed to work towards vaccination, but now she's not. The author is enforcing his boundaries, which are health-based. However, the sudden shift in her stance might be due to her own evolving beliefs, and the author's response could be seen as too rigid, potentially causing unnecessary conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's position is ethically sound based on public health, the way he's handling the ultimatum might not account for the relationship dynamics. But given that he's provided a compromise (a slight delay in the schedule), and the fianc\u00e9e is still opposing, the author's decision to set a firm boundary isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
