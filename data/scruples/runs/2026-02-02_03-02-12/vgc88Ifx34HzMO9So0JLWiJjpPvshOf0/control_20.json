Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum about vaccines to their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions they knew their fianc\u00e9e was unvaccinated before proposing. They had discussed alternative schedules, maybe following a different country's plan. There was an agreement that the kids would be vaccinated. Now, after a month of engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is more against vaccines, especially Hep B at birth. The author, a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and doesn't want to take chances. They set an ultimatum: one month delay before starting an alternative schedule. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling it manipulative, and the author is questioning if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent in a relationship, the importance of vaccines, and the ultimatum. In relationships, both partners should have mutual respect and understanding. The author had discussed vaccines before proposing, so it's part of their future planning. However, the fianc\u00e9e is now changing her stance, which the author sees as a betrayal. \n\nVaccines are a medical issue with strong evidence supporting their safety and efficacy. The fianc\u00e9e's stance includes conspiracy theories (Big Pharma) and denying scientific data. The author is trying to compromise by allowing a slight delay, which is reasonable given their concerns. But the fianc\u00e9e isn't willing to budge despite evidence presented. \n\nSetting an ultimatum can be seen as a last resort when there's a non-negotiable issue. The author is standing by their values and safety concerns. However, ultimatums can be perceived as controlling or manipulative, depending on how they're presented. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests that the ultimatum was unexpected or not communicated well. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a matter of conflicting values. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their stance on vaccines, especially since it was discussed before marriage. The fianc\u00e9e is in a difficult position too, but if she's unwilling to compromise even slightly, the author's decision to walk away might be necessary. However, giving an ultimatum can be seen as harsh, even if justified. \n\nI need to check if there's any ethical or moral wrongdoing. The author isn't forcing vaccination; they're setting a boundary. The fianc\u00e9e's initial agreement now being reversed could be an issue. But the ultimatum's timing and delivery might be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for standing by their beliefs and setting a boundary, especially when it's a matter of health. The fianc\u00e9e's refusal to engage with evidence is a separate issue. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
