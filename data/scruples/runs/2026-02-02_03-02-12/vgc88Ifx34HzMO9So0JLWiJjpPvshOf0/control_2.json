Prior to that we discussed alternative schedules and maybe following one from a different country (both of us are US residents) so she could have solace in not, as she puts, \u201coverloading the baby\u2019s little body\u201d. We came to an agreement that the kids would get vaccinated and follow some sort of schedule. \n\nNow after being engaged for a month she brings it up again how she\u2019s so against it and hates the idea of any vaccines. She\u2019s so opposed to the Hep B vaccine at birth because she can\u2019t concede any thought of how a baby would contract it unless she\u2019s somehow positive for it. (She\u2019s never set food in a medical facility period, no lab records, no health records, etc). Admittedly I\u2019m a little stretched to see how an infant could contract it also, but I\u2019m on board with vaccine schedules, so it doesn\u2019t bother me. \n\nUltimately I came to the idea that my maximum I could ever allow is let the baby go one month before beginning some sort of alternative schedule. I\u2019m a health care worker myself, and while so unlikely that I could ever carry something home, I do not want that risk. Let alone other adults or children being around to get any child sick. \n\nShe\u2019s up in arms about this now saying how I\u2019m being manipulative and abusive because I\u2019m giving her ultimatums over this. The first night we decided to enter our relationship I told her i will never change and that my children are going to be vaccinated. She said she understood and would be willing to work towards it. Suddenly she\u2019s not. \n\nI don\u2019t want things to end. But even after looking up and discussing the articles from WHO and the CDC, finding items that show it\u2019s literally more likely to contract one of the various diseases rather than have a complication from a vaccine, she\u2019s even more adamant than ever for being against them. In the past she\u2019s said how it\u2019s all a big ploy from big pharma to get our money (I\u2019ve checked my insurance and the cost would be insanely negligible, I\u2019m pretty sure the first round are nearly free with my insurance) and that vaccines don\u2019t actually work. I show her data relating to Japan and whooping cough and data now with the recent outbreak of measles. She\u2019s not buying it.  \n\nSo I told her. I gave her the maximum of what I\u2019m comfortable with. I can\u2019t go further than that. And now she\u2019s upset that I\u2019m willing to walk away over this fight. So I beg the question to you reddit. AITA? \n\nTLDR; fianc\u00e9e thinks vaccines are a hoax and don\u2019t work. I offered a slightly deferred and alternative schedule as the maximum and she could take it or leave it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9e who is against vaccines, and the author is giving an ultimatum that if she doesn't agree to a modified vaccination schedule for their future children, he'll walk away. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentioned they discussed alternative schedules before the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e is now more opposed to Hep B, questioning its necessity. The author, as a healthcare worker, is concerned about risks and wants the kids vaccinated. He's given a compromise of a one-month delay in starting the schedule but she's up in arms, calling it manipulative and abusive.\n\nThe author says he's given her an ultimatum, which she finds controlling. She initially agreed to work towards vaccination but now refuses. He's tried showing data from WHO and CDC but she's still unconvinced, even claiming vaccines are a hoax.\n\nSo, is he wrong? Well, in relationships, big decisions like vaccines can be a deal-breaker. He's made his stance clear from the start and tried to compromise. However, giving an ultimatum on such a significant issue might be seen as coercive, especially if she feels pressured. But he's also standing by his beliefs and non-negotiables. \n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. From a neutral standpoint, if both parties can't meet in the middle, it's hard to say. But if he's given her a reasonable compromise and she's still not on board, maybe he's not wrong. However, ultimatums can be seen as manipulative regardless of the topic. But if he's being honest about his non-negotiables from the start, that's fair. \n\nBut she's changed her stance after the engagement. Maybe he should have addressed it earlier? Or maybe it's okay because he's given her time and a compromise. I think it's a tough call. However, considering that he's a healthcare worker and she's not budging despite evidence, he's probably not in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that using an ultimatum is wrong. Hmm.\n"
