Things were going great until one day they just weren't. We stopped speaking 3 months ago and i was totally fine. Yesterday I get a LONG message from him saying that he wanted to tell me that he was gay and that he didn't mean to string me on but he was just scared of coming out and he wanted to be friends. \nI was fine with this. People sometimes do get scared of coming out and I was willing to be friends with him because despite the fact he hid this from me I like him as a person.\nWe spoke for a few hours but towards the end of the conversation I was pissed. \nI have always told him I don't like liars. I can forgive a white lies, and I can forgive people who admit to their lies once called out but I won't tolerate lying and then doubling down on that lie. \nThese are the things that came out in quick succession that pissed me off \n\n\"I didn't want to hurt you, I just didn't know I was gay\"\nThen \n\"I slept with nearly 20 men before I got with you, and a few while we were together\" \n\nAnd \n\n\"I just thought I might be bisexual because I was attracted to you\"\nThen \n\"I don't believe in bisexuality, it's just an excuse\" \n\nI pointed out the inconsistensies in his story and that he knows how I feel about doubling down on a lie so if he wanted to come completely clean and tell me what actually happened, which was he used me as a cover story while he was seeing men behind my back, I could accept it. \n\nHe doubled down anyway. So I told him I can't be his friend because I can't trust him. \nNow he's telling people im homophobic because I didn't accept him straight away, but I did. I just didn't accept him lying to me. \n\nAITA \nTL;DR - ex boyfriend slept with men before, during and after our relationship and told me he was straight the whole time. Came out as gay to me and then lied about a) being attracted to me and b) not knowing he was gay. Then doubled down on the lie and I cut him off - AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after cutting off their ex-boyfriend who came out as gay. \n\nFirst, the ex was in a year-and-a-half relationship. He came out as gay after breaking up, revealing he had been sleeping with men before, during, and even after the relationship. He initially told the author he was straight. Then, he made conflicting statements about his sexuality: saying he didn't know he was gay, sleeping with men, calling himself bisexual at first, and then denying bisexuality. The author got upset because the ex lied and doubled down on the lies when confronted. They decided to cut him off, and now the ex is calling the author homophobic.\n\nThe author's main issue is the dishonesty. They mention they can forgive some lies if someone is honest about them but not if they double down. The ex's behavior shows inconsistency and deceit. The author's response was to end the friendship, which is a personal choice. The ex's accusation of homophobia is unfounded because the author didn't reject the coming out but rejected the lies. \n\nThe key points are the lies and the doubling down. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing trust. The ex's actions were dishonest, and the author's reaction is a consequence of that. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
