Things were going great until one day they just weren't. We stopped speaking 3 months ago and i was totally fine. Yesterday I get a LONG message from him saying that he wanted to tell me that he was gay and that he didn't mean to string me on but he was just scared of coming out and he wanted to be friends. \nI was fine with this. People sometimes do get scared of coming out and I was willing to be friends with him because despite the fact he hid this from me I like him as a person.\nWe spoke for a few hours but towards the end of the conversation I was pissed. \nI have always told him I don't like liars. I can forgive a white lies, and I can forgive people who admit to their lies once called out but I won't tolerate lying and then doubling down on that lie. \nThese are the things that came out in quick succession that pissed me off \n\n\"I didn't want to hurt you, I just didn't know I was gay\"\nThen \n\"I slept with nearly 20 men before I got with you, and a few while we were together\" \n\nAnd \n\n\"I just thought I might be bisexual because I was attracted to you\"\nThen \n\"I don't believe in bisexuality, it's just an excuse\" \n\nI pointed out the inconsistensies in his story and that he knows how I feel about doubling down on a lie so if he wanted to come completely clean and tell me what actually happened, which was he used me as a cover story while he was seeing men behind my back, I could accept it. \n\nHe doubled down anyway. So I told him I can't be his friend because I can't trust him. \nNow he's telling people im homophobic because I didn't accept him straight away, but I did. I just didn't accept him lying to me. \n\nAITA \nTL;DR - ex boyfriend slept with men before, during and after our relationship and told me he was straight the whole time. Came out as gay to me and then lied about a) being attracted to me and b) not knowing he was gay. Then doubled down on the lie and I cut him off - AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their ex-boyfriend who came out as gay after the relationship ended. The user provided a detailed scenario.\n\nFirst, the ex was in a relationship for 1.5 years, then stopped talking 3 months ago. The ex then sent a long message coming out as gay, explaining he was scared. The author was okay with being friends but got upset when the ex revealed inconsistencies: he didn't know he was gay, slept with many men before and during the relationship, called bisexuality an excuse, and doubled down on lies when confronted.\n\nThe key points here are trust and honesty. The ex lied about his sexual orientation, which is a significant issue. The author made it clear they don't tolerate lying, especially when the person doubles down. The ex's actions might have been due to fear of coming out, but the author felt betrayed by the deception and lack of honesty, leading to cutting off contact.\n\nThe ex is now accusing the author of being homophobic, but the author accepted the coming out and was willing to be friends. The main issue is the lying, not the sexuality itself. The author's response was based on the dishonesty, not prejudice. So, the author isn't in the wrong here because they valued honesty and couldn't trust someone who lied repeatedly. The answer should be B (No).\n"
