Things were going great until one day they just weren't. We stopped speaking 3 months ago and i was totally fine. Yesterday I get a LONG message from him saying that he wanted to tell me that he was gay and that he didn't mean to string me on but he was just scared of coming out and he wanted to be friends. \nI was fine with this. People sometimes do get scared of coming out and I was willing to be friends with him because despite the fact he hid this from me I like him as a person.\nWe spoke for a few hours but towards the end of the conversation I was pissed. \nI have always told him I don't like liars. I can forgive a white lies, and I can forgive people who admit to their lies once called out but I won't tolerate lying and then doubling down on that lie. \nThese are the things that came out in quick succession that pissed me off \n\n\"I didn't want to hurt you, I just didn't know I was gay\"\nThen \n\"I slept with nearly 20 men before I got with you, and a few while we were together\" \n\nAnd \n\n\"I just thought I might be bisexual because I was attracted to you\"\nThen \n\"I don't believe in bisexuality, it's just an excuse\" \n\nI pointed out the inconsistensies in his story and that he knows how I feel about doubling down on a lie so if he wanted to come completely clean and tell me what actually happened, which was he used me as a cover story while he was seeing men behind my back, I could accept it. \n\nHe doubled down anyway. So I told him I can't be his friend because I can't trust him. \nNow he's telling people im homophobic because I didn't accept him straight away, but I did. I just didn't accept him lying to me. \n\nAITA \nTL;DR - ex boyfriend slept with men before, during and after our relationship and told me he was straight the whole time. Came out as gay to me and then lied about a) being attracted to me and b) not knowing he was gay. Then doubled down on the lie and I cut him off - AITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their ex-boyfriend coming out as gay after the relationship ended. \n\nFirst, the ex hid his sexuality during the relationship. The author was okay with being friends but became upset when he lied about being attracted to him and then doubled down on those lies. The ex also mentioned sleeping with men before and during the relationship, which adds to the betrayal.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and trust. The author says they don't tolerate doubling down on lies. The ex came out as gay but then made conflicting statements about his sexuality and attractions. When confronted, he didn't correct his lies, which led the author to cut him off. The ex is now accusing the author of being homophobic, but the author is standing by their decision because of the dishonesty, not the sexuality itself.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for cutting off someone who came out but lied. The author's stance is about the lies and lack of trust, not the person's sexuality. Since the lies were about the nature of their relationship and the ex's honesty, the author's reaction seems justified. The ex's actions involved deceit beyond just coming out, which is separate from homophobia. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing honesty and trust in their relationships.\n"
