What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the dentist made a gendered comment about pain and childbirth, and the author lied about being sterile to make him feel bad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's behavior. He said something dismissive and probably sexist, linking pain tolerance to childbirth. That's not okay. Patients should be taken seriously, especially regarding their pain.\n\nThe author was hurt by that comment and wanted to retaliate. Lying about being sterile was a way to make the dentist uncomfortable. Now, is that justified? Well, revenge is a tricky thing. While the dentist's comment was wrong, the author's response involved lying to cause emotional discomfort. \n\nBut the author's action was a direct response to a personal slight. However, the dentist's statement was unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. The author had a right to be upset. But lying to make someone feel bad could be seen as crossing a line, even if the other person was in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the context is important. The author was in a vulnerable position, sensitive to pain, and had a traumatic experience before. The dentist's comment added insult to injury. The author's reaction might be a form of self-defense in terms of standing up for themselves. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the dentist's comment was unprofessional, the author's lie is a form of retaliation. However, in some contexts, people might see it as a justified response to sexism. But generally, lying to hurt someone, even if they're wrong, is usually considered in the wrong. So maybe answer A, but I'm a bit conflicted. The dentist's behavior was worse, but the author's response could still be seen as the asshole move. So probably A.\n"
