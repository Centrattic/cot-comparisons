What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author went to a dentist who was dismissive about their pain sensitivity. The dentist made a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth. The author then lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad. The mom is upset, and the author is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's actions. Making a gender-based comment about pain and childbirth is unprofessional and inappropriate. The dentist shouldn't have made that remark, which was likely a way to minimize the patient's concerns. That's a problem.\n\nThen the author's response was to lie about being sterile. The intent was to make the dentist feel bad. Now, the author's actions were a direct retaliation. Even though the dentist was in the wrong, the author's response was to deceive and hurt the dentist's feelings. But is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the dentist said something offensive and unprofessional. The author was upset, which is understandable. But on the other hand, retaliating by lying and making a personal attack (implying sterility) is not a professional or constructive response. The author could have addressed the issue through appropriate channels, like filing a complaint or not returning to the dentist. \n\nThe author might feel justified because they were upset, but using a lie to hurt someone else's feelings crosses a line. It's not about whether the dentist deserved it, but about the right way to handle the situation. The author's action was a personal attack rather than addressing the professional issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their response was inappropriate and unprofessional.\n"
