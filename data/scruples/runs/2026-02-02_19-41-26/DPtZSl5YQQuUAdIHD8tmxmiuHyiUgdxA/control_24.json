What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dentist making a gendered comment about pain and childbirth, and the author retaliating by lying about being sterile.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dentist's actions. He said something like \"You are a woman so you need to get used to pain. What are you going to do when you give birth.\" That's a problematic statement. It's not just rude but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women and pain. It's unprofessional and dismissive, which could be considered a form of harassment or at least very inappropriate behavior.\n\nThen, the author responds by lying about being sterile. The dentist was uncomfortable, apologized, and the argument is whether this retaliation is justified. The author's mom thinks they were a jerk, but the author thinks it was funny and a lesson.\n\nThe key points here are the dentist's unprofessional conduct and the author's response. While the dentist's comment was clearly wrong, the author's retaliation involved deception. However, the dentist's behavior was a violation of professional standards and could be considered a form of gender-based harassment. The author's lie, while unkind, was in direct response to that inappropriate comment. The dentist's comment was not just a personal opinion but a professional misstep that affected the patient's care.\n\nIn such cases, patients have the right to demand respectful treatment. The author's action, while perhaps not the most appropriate way to address it, was a reaction to being mocked and humiliated. It's a question of proportionality. Lying might not be the best approach, but the dentist's actions were in the wrong. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, the dentist's behavior was clearly unacceptable, and the author's response, while not ideal, was a form of self-advocacy. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n"
