What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \".

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a bad experience with a dentist who made a sexist comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth. In response, the author lied to the dentist, saying they couldn't have kids, which made the dentist uncomfortable. The mom thinks the author was a jerk, but the author thinks it was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate and unprofessional. Making a patient feel like they should endure pain due to their gender is not acceptable. The author was sensitive to pain and had a traumatic history, which adds context to their frustration. \n\nWhen the dentist said that, the author's reaction was to lie about being sterile. The dentist then apologized, and the mom disapproved. The author justifies it as making the dentist think twice about his behavior. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the dentist's comment was wrong, and the author had a right to be upset. However, retaliating by lying and making the dentist uncomfortable could be seen as crossing a line. The author's action was intentional to hurt the dentist's feelings, which might not be the appropriate response in a professional setting. \n\nProfessional boundaries are important. While the dentist's behavior was unprofessional, the author's response might not be the best way to address it. A more constructive approach could have been to report the dentist, leave a review, or not return. Lying to the dentist could be seen as disrespectful and unprofessional as well. \n\nAlso, the author's mom's reaction suggests that the lie was harsh. The dentist did apologize after the comment, so maybe the author's action was an overreaction. Even if the dentist deserved it, the lie could be considered inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the dentist was wrong, the author's method of response might not be the right way to handle it. So the author is in the wrong for making the dentist feel bad in that way.\n"
