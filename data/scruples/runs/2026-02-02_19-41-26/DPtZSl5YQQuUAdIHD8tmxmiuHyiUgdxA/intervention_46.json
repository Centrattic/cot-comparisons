What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a dentist making a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, and the patient lying about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate. Telling a patient, especially a woman, that they need to get used to pain for childbirth is sexist and unprofessional. That's a red flag. It's not okay to make such a remark in a professional setting, especially in healthcare where empathy and respect are crucial.\n\nThen the patient's response: lying about being sterile. The key here is intent. The patient was hurt by the dentist's comment, which was both unprofessional and sexist. Their response was to say something that would make the dentist uncomfortable. The patient's action was a form of retaliation. \n\nNow, is that justified? Well, while the dentist was in the wrong first, the patient's response was a lie designed to cause discomfort. It's a form of emotional manipulation. Even if the dentist deserved it, lying to make someone feel bad crosses a line. The patient's action might be seen as a way to take power back, but it's still a violation of trust and honesty. \n\nOn the other hand, the dentist's initial comment was wrong. The patient had a right to be upset, and the dentist's behavior was unprofessional. However, the patient's action to retaliate with a lie might be considered an asshole move because it's dishonest and intended to harm the dentist's feelings. \n\nSo, the dentist was wrong first, but the patient's response, while understandable in terms of anger, was not appropriate. The patient's action could be seen as the asshole move because lying to make someone feel bad is not a constructive or ethical response. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
