What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. So, the situation is the author had a bad experience with a dentist who made a comment implying that women should just tough out pain because of childbirth. The author, who is very sensitive to pain, was already on edge because of past bad dentists. The dentist's comment was clearly inappropriate and offensive. The author then lied about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable. The mom is upset, but the author thinks it was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dentist's actions. The dentist made a sexist and dismissive remark, which is unprofessional. The author had the right to be upset and hold the dentist accountable. However, the author's response was to lie and make a hurtful comment. The lie wasn't just a harmless joke; it's a personal attack that could be seen as retaliatory. Even though the dentist was in the wrong, the author's response might cross into unprofessional or disrespectful behavior. \n\nBut wait, the author was trying to stand up for themselves after being disrespected. The dentist's comment was about gender, so the author's response was a direct pushback. However, lying about being sterile is a personal detail that might not be warranted, even in retaliation. The dentist might not have known the author's personal life, so the lie was a strategic choice to hurt the dentist's feelings. \n\nIs it okay to respond to unprofessionalism with unprofessionalism? The author's action might be seen as justified in the moment, but in a professional setting, the appropriate response is usually to address the behavior without reciprocating with personal attacks. The author's method could be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial comment was wrong. \n\nSo, the dentist was definitely at fault, but the author's response might still be considered wrong because it involved a lie that's meant to hurt personally. The author might have valid reasons for being angry, but the way they reacted could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using a personal, deceptive response to retaliate.\n"
