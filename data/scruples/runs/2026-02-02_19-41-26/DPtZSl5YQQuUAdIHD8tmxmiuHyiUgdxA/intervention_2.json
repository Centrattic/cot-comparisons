What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a dentist making a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, and the patient lying about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's actions. He made a sexist and inappropriate comment, which was unprofessional and possibly discriminatory. That's definitely wrong. But then the patient retaliated by lying about being infertile to embarrass the dentist. The question is whether the patient's response was justified.\n\nThe patient had a history of changing dentists due to not taking pain seriously, which shows prior issues. The dentist's comment was a clear breach of professional behavior. However, the patient's response was to deceive the dentist, causing him discomfort. While the dentist's comment was inexcusable, the patient's response might be seen as crossing a line. Lying to make someone feel bad is a form of retaliation, which could be considered unprofessional or disrespectful, even if the initial comment was wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The dentist's behavior was worse, but the patient's action was still a form of revenge. However, in a professional context, patients shouldn't feel they have to retaliate in such a personal way. The dentist should have maintained professional boundaries, but the patient could have addressed the comment without personalizing it. Since the dentist apologized after the incident, maybe the patient's response made him aware of his mistake. But the lie was intentional to hurt, which is not acceptable. So, the patient's action was in the wrong, even if the dentist was at fault first. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
