What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in the situation described. The dentist made a sexist comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth. The author, being very sensitive to pain, had a bad history with other dentists. When the dentist made that comment, the author lied about being sterile to make him feel bad. The mom is upset, but the author thinks it was funny and deserved.\n\nFirst, the dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate and unprofessional. Making a sexist remark that minimizes a patient's pain experience is wrong. The author was in a vulnerable position, having a history of bad dental experiences, so the dentist should have been more empathetic.\n\nBut then the author's response was to lie about being sterile. That's a personal attack and unprofessional as well. Even if the dentist said something wrong, retaliating with a lie that could be hurtful or offensive might cross a line. The author's action could be seen as mean-spirited, even if the dentist was at fault. The fact that the author thought it was funny and that the mom called them a jerk suggests that the action wasn't proportionate and could be considered cruel.\n\nHowever, there's a context of the dentist's unprofessional behavior. The author was trying to stand up for themselves in a situation where they felt disrespected. But the method chosen might have been inappropriate. The key here is whether the author's response was justified. While the dentist's comment was unacceptable, the lie could be seen as an inconsiderate reaction. It's possible the author was reacting in anger, which can lead to unwise actions. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, while the dentist's comment is definitely wrong, the author's retaliation might be seen as crossing the line from defending oneself to being an asshole. The lie could have been hurtful if the dentist had patients who couldn't have children, adding unnecessary cruelty. The author might not have considered the broader impact of their lie. \n\nSo, while the dentist is clearly at fault for the initial comment, the author's response, though understandable in the moment, was unnecessary and harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they chose a harsh and untrue method to retaliate, which doesn't align with respectful conflict resolution, even if the other party was wrong.\n"
