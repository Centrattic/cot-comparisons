What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a dentist making a sexist comment, and the author lying about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The dentist said something like \"You are a woman so you need to get used to pain. What are you going to do when you give birth?\" That's clearly inappropriate and sexist. The author felt they were disrespected and decided to retaliate by lying about being sterile. \n\nThe key points here are the dentist's sexist remark and the author's response. The dentist's comment is unprofessional and should be condemned. However, the author's response\u2014making a false statement to hurt the dentist's feelings\u2014might be seen as crossing a line. \n\nOn one hand, the dentist's behavior was wrong. On the other, the author used a lie to get back at him, which could be considered unethical or unprofessional. Even if the author felt justified, lying in a medical setting can have consequences. Plus, the author's mom is upset, which suggests that the response might be seen as too harsh by others.\n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at both the provocation and the response. While the dentist was in the wrong, the author's action of lying to make the dentist feel bad might be seen as an overreaction. The line between justified retaliation and being an asshole can be thin. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because even though the dentist was rude, responding with a lie in a professional setting isn't appropriate. The author could have addressed the issue through proper channels instead of personal retaliation. So the answer is A.\n"
