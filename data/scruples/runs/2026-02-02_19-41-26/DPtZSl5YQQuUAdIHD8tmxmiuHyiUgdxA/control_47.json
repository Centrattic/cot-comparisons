What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after making their dentist feel bad. The situation is that the dentist made a sexist comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, and the author lied about being sterile to make him uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's comment. Saying \"You are a woman so you need to get used to pain\" is clearly inappropriate and sexist. It's a form of gender-based stereotyping and could be considered discriminatory. The dentist shouldn't make comments that generalize or belittle a patient's experience based on their gender.\n\nThen the author's response was to lie about being sterile. The intent was to make the dentist feel bad, which is understandable given the offensive comment. However, lying can be seen as a form of retaliation. Even if the dentist's comment was wrong, the author's action might be crossing a line because it's a personal attack. The dentist's behavior was unprofessional, but the author's response could be seen as unprofessional too. \n\nThe author is in a vulnerable position, having a traumatic history with previous dentists. The dentist's comment likely exacerbated their anxiety. However, the lie about being sterile is a direct personal jab, which could be hurtful even if it's a lie. The dentist's discomfort is a result of the author's retaliation, but is that justified?\n\nIn professional settings, patients have the right to feel respected, and the dentist's comment was a breach of that. The author's response, while a form of self-defense in a way, might not be the appropriate way to handle it. A better approach might have been to confront the comment directly without lying, or to report the dentist's behavior. \n\nThe mom's reaction suggests that she thinks the author overreacted. The author might feel justified because the dentist was unprofessional, but lying could be seen as the wrong approach. So, while the dentist's actions were wrong, the author's method of retaliation might not be the right way to handle it. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
