What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dentist made a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, and the author lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The dentist's statement seems gender-based and dismissive of the patient's concern about pain. That's pretty rude and unprofessional. The author has a history of switching dentists because of pain issues, so this isn't the first time they've faced this problem.\n\nBut then the author's response was to lie about being sterile. The dentist was uncomfortable, and the mom was shocked. The author thinks it was funny and that the dentist deserved it as a lesson. \n\nNow, the key question is whether the author's retaliation was justified. While the dentist's comment was inappropriate, retaliating with a lie that could be hurtful or offensive\u2014especially about someone's ability to have children\u2014might cross a line. Even if the dentist was in the wrong, the author's response could be seen as unprofessional and possibly hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author's mom called them a jerk, which might indicate that their action was socially unacceptable. The author might have wanted to teach the dentist a lesson, but using a personal lie might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, even though the dentist's behavior was wrong, the author's response might not be justified. The appropriate response would be to address the comment professionally, maybe by reporting it or leaving the practice, rather than retaliating with a lie. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
