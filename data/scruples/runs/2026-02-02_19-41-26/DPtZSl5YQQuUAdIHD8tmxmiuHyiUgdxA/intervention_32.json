What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a bad experience with a dentist who made a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth. The author then lied to the dentist, saying they can't have kids, to make him feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's actions. The dentist made a gendered comment, which is inappropriate. The author was already sensitive to pain and had a traumatic past with dentists. The dentist's remark could be seen as dismissive and possibly sexist. But does that justify the author's response?\n\nThe author's response was to lie about being sterile. That's a personal and sensitive topic. Even if the dentist was in the wrong, retaliating by lying about such a private matter might not be the best approach. The author's mom was upset, and the dentist apologized afterward. The question is whether the author's actions were justified or if they overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, the dentist's comment was offensive. On the other, the author's response could be considered crossing a line. The author's mom thinks they were a jerk, which adds to the social aspect. The author might feel justified, but others might see it as an escalated situation where they didn't handle it professionally. The key is whether lying to make someone feel bad is an appropriate response. Most people would argue that even if someone is wrong, retaliating with a personal lie isn't acceptable. So the author might be in the wrong.\n"
