What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dentist making a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, and the author lying about being sterile to make him feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's comment. Saying \"You are a woman so you need to get used to pain. What are you going to do when you give birth\" is pretty dismissive and inappropriate. It's not just about the pain, but also making a gendered assumption and being unprofessional. That's a problem.\n\nBut then the author retaliates by lying about being sterile. The dentist was uncomfortable, and the author's mom is upset. The author thinks it was funny and that the dentist deserved it. \n\nNow, the key points here are about the right to retaliate and whether the response was justified. While the dentist's comment was unprofessional and potentially sexist, the author's response was a lie intended to make the dentist feel bad. The dentist might not have known the patient's actual fertility status, so the lie was a deliberate attempt to humiliate. \n\nIn professional settings, even if someone acts inappropriately, the appropriate response is usually to address the issue directly, maybe report it, or seek another provider. Retaliating with a lie could be seen as crossing a line. The author's action was meant to cause discomfort, which might not be the best approach, even if the original comment was wrong.\n\nAlso, the author's mom is upset, indicating that the lie was harsh. The dentist did apologize afterward, which suggests he realized his mistake, but the author's response might have been excessive. The question is whether the author's retaliation was justified. While the dentist's behavior was inexcusable, the author's action was a direct and personal attack, which could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
