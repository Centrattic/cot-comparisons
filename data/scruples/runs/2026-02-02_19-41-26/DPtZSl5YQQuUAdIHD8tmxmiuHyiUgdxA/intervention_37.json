What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is very sensitive to pain, changing dentists after a traumatic experience. The new dentist, recommended by the author's mom, made a comment about women needing to get used to pain and mentioned childbirth. The author then lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dentist's actions. He made a gender-based comment that was dismissive of the patient's concerns about pain. That's unprofessional and possibly inappropriate. However, the author's response was to lie about being sterile, which is a personal and sensitive topic. \n\nThe key points here are the dentist's unprofessional behavior versus the author's retaliatory action. While the dentist's comment was wrong, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. Lying about infertility is a personal attack and might be considered disrespectful or cruel, even if motivated by anger at the dentist's remark. The dentist apologized after the incident, which shows he recognized the inappropriateness of his initial comment. \n\nThe author's justification is that the dentist deserved it for being smug, but this doesn't excuse lying to cause someone else discomfort. The author's actions, while understandable in terms of feeling wronged, could be seen as taking the situation too far. The mom's reaction also indicates that the author's response was excessive. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because their retaliation was unprofessional and potentially hurtful, even if the dentist made an inconsiderate comment. The appropriate response would have been to address the comment directly without resorting to a personal lie.\n"
