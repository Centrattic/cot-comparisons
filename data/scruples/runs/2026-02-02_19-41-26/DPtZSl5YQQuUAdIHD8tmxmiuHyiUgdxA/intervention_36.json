What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's dentist made a sexist comment about needing to get used to pain for childbirth. The author then lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad. The mom is upset, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's response was justified. The dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate and sexist. Making a patient feel that their pain isn't taken seriously, especially with a gendered remark, is unprofessional. However, the author's retaliation\u2014lying about being sterile\u2014was meant to make the dentist uncomfortable. \n\nWhile the comment from the dentist was wrong, the author's response might be considered crossing a line. Lying in a medical context can be problematic, even if it's not directly related to the treatment. It could potentially harm the relationship between the patient and healthcare provider, leading to mistrust or affecting future care. The dentist did apologize after the incident, so maybe the author's action was unnecessary once an apology was given.\n\nOn the other hand, the dentist's initial statement was offensive, and the author felt empowered to respond. However, the ethical question is whether the response was appropriate. Healthcare providers are expected to maintain professionalism, and patients have the right to feel safe and respected. But using deception to retaliate might not set a good example, even if the offense was real.\n\nSo, while the dentist is clearly at fault for the comment, the author's action of lying to make them feel bad could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly unprofessional as well. The mom's reaction suggests that the author's response was excessive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for responding with a lie rather than addressing the issue through appropriate channels, like reporting the comment or seeking another dentist without retaliating."
