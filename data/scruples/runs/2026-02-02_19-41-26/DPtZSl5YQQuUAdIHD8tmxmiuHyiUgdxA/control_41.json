What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their dentist feel bad. The situation is that the dentist made a sexist comment, and the author lied about being sterile to get back at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's actions. He made a dismissive and sexist remark, which is definitely inappropriate. The author felt wronged and wanted to retaliate. Now, the question is whether the author's response was justified or if they overstepped.\n\nRetaliation can be a tricky area. Even if the dentist was wrong, the author's response was a lie that could cause the dentist personal discomfort or embarrassment. While the dentist's comment was inexcusable, using personal deception to make someone feel bad might not be the best approach. It's important to consider the ethical implications here. Lying, even as a form of revenge, can be seen as dishonest and potentially hurtful. \n\nHowever, the dentist did make a harmful generalization based on the author's gender, which is a serious issue. The author's sensitivity to pain and past traumatic experiences add context. But does that justify lying? Maybe not. The dentist's comment was unprofessional, but the author's response crossed into deception, which could be considered a wrong action regardless of the provocation.\n\nAlso, the author's mom's reaction is a clue. She called them a jerk, which might indicate that the social norm is that the author overreacted. But the dentist's behavior was definitely in the wrong initially. However, the question is about the author's actions, not the dentist's. So the author's lie is the action in question here.\n\nIn moral terms, even if someone else is at fault, retaliating with a lie might not be the right choice. The author could have addressed the comment professionally without resorting to deception. So, while the dentist deserved criticism for his remark, the author's method of response is questionable. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because lying to retaliate is generally considered unethical, even in response to a wrong.\n"
