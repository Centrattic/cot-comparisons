What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dentist making a comment about women and pain during childbirth, and the author lying about being sterile to make him feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dentist was dismissive of the patient's concerns about pain, which is already a problem. Then he made a sexist remark, linking the patient's need to tolerate pain to childbirth, which is a gendered assumption. The author, feeling wronged, lied about being sterile to shock him. The dentist apologized, and the author's mom is upset, but the author thinks they were justified.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The dentist's comment was unprofessional and sexist. That's a big issue. However, the author's response was to lie and make the dentist feel bad. While the dentist deserved to be called out for his comment, using a personal lie to retaliate might cross a line. The author's action was meant to humiliate the dentist, which is a form of emotional harm. Even if the dentist was in the wrong, the author's method of response could be seen as inappropriate. The author's mom thinks they're a jerk, which adds to the idea that their action was impulsive and maybe not the best approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the dentist was unprofessional, and the author felt their pain wasn't taken seriously. The lie was a reaction to that, but lying is generally not a constructive way to handle the situation. The author could have addressed the comment through a complaint or by seeking another dentist, but instead chose to retaliate, which might come off as unprofessional as well. \n\nSo, the dentist was wrong for making the sexist comment, but the author's response, while understandable in emotion, is still not the right way to handle it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using a lie to get back at the dentist, even if the dentist was also wrong.\n"
