What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dentist making a comment about needing to get used to pain, referencing childbirth, and the patient lying about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dentist was dismissive of the patient's sensitivity to pain, which is a valid concern. The comment about childbirth is problematic because it's not relevant to dental treatment and seems to minimize the patient's experience. The patient then lies about being sterile to retaliate, causing the dentist discomfort.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The dentist's comment was unprofessional and possibly gender-based. The patient's response was a lie intended to make the dentist feel bad. While the dentist's behavior was inappropriate, retaliating with a false statement could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the patient felt wronged, using deception to humiliate the dentist might not be the right approach. The patient could have addressed the issue in a more constructive way, like reporting the dentist's behavior or seeking another provider. The mom's reaction also suggests that the patient's action was considered rude or excessive. So, while the dentist was at fault for the initial comment, the patient's response might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their retaliatory action.\n"
