What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the dentist made a sexist comment about needing to get used to pain because of childbirth, and the author lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dentist's actions. The dentist made a generalization based on the patient's gender, which is inappropriate. That's a red flag. The author was sensitive to pain and had a traumatic experience before, so the dentist not taking that seriously is another issue.\n\nThen the author's response was to lie about being sterile. The dentist was uncomfortable and apologized afterward. The author thinks it was funny and that the dentist deserved it. The mom is upset, calling the author a jerk.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The dentist's comment was sexist and unprofessional. The author's retaliation was a lie that could be seen as a form of payback. However, retaliating with a lie might not be the appropriate way to handle it. The author could have addressed the comment in a different way, like confronting the dentist professionally or leaving a review.\n\nBut the dentist's behavior was also unprofessional. The author's lie might be justified in some people's eyes because the dentist deserved to feel the discomfort they caused. However, lying could be considered a form of verbal abuse, even if it's a response to being disrespected.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate and appropriate. While the dentist was wrong, the author's method of retaliation could be seen as crossing a line. The lie might have been hurtful and not a constructive way to address the issue. The author might have felt justified, but the action itself could be seen as the wrong approach.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the dentist was at fault, the author's response was not appropriate. However, some might argue B (No) because the dentist's comment was so offensive that the author's retaliation is understandable. But in a professional setting, patients shouldn't retaliate with lies. The appropriate action would be to report the inappropriate comment or take other measures, not to lie. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
