What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their dentist feel bad after a hurtful comment.\n\nThe dentist made a gendered remark about women needing to get used to pain because of childbirth. The author, being very sensitive to pain, found this offensive and responded with a lie about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable. The author's mom thinks they were a jerk, but the author finds it funny and believes the dentist deserved it.\n\nFirst, the dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate. It's a sexist statement that dismisses the patient's concerns and uses gender to justify poor treatment. That's unprofessional and wrong. The author had a right to be upset and felt disrespected.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to lie and say they can't have kids. While the lie was a direct retort to the dentist's comment, it's still a lie. The dentist did apologize afterward, so maybe the author's actions led to that. But the lie could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the dentist was in the wrong, retaliating with a personal lie might not be the best approach. It's a form of revenge that could be seen as unprofessional, even if the initial comment was worse.\n\nThe author's mom is upset, which suggests family dynamics are involved. The author thinks they were justified, but others might see it as unnecessary. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportionate. The dentist's comment was offensive, but the lie was a personal attack. While the comment was worse, the author's response could still be seen as in the wrong because it's not addressing the issue constructively. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the dentist's behavior was bad, retaliating with a lie isn't appropriate. The author should have addressed the issue without personalizing the response.\n"
