What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for making their dentist feel bad. The situation is that the dentist made a sexist comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth. The author, being very sensitive to pain, was already in a traumatic situation and decided to fire back with a lie about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dentist's actions. The dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate and sexist. It's unprofessional and dismissive of the patient's concerns. That's a red flag. The author had a right to feel disrespected here. But the author's response was to lie and say they can't have kids, which is a personal attack. \n\nNow, considering the author's intent: they wanted to make the dentist feel bad because they found his comment offensive. The dentist was unprofessional, but the author's retaliation crosses into personal territory. Lying about sterility is a hurtful thing to say, even if it's a lie. It's not just about the truth but the impact. The dentist was uncomfortable, and the author's mom was shocked. \n\nIs it justified? Well, the dentist was wrong, but the author's response might not be the best way to handle it. Retaliating in a personal way can be seen as unprofessional too. The author might have wanted to teach a lesson, but the method could be problematic. It's a matter of whether the ends justify the means. Even if the dentist deserved it, the author's action could be considered crossing a line. \n\nAlso, in a professional setting, patients should address issues through proper channels, like formal complaints, rather than personal insults. The author's action might have been a way to vent frustration, but it's not a recommended approach. \n\nSo, the dentist was wrong, but the author's response is still questionable. They have a right to be upset, but their retaliation is not appropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their response, even if the dentist was unprofessional.\n"
