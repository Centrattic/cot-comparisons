What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's very sensitive to pain, had a bad experience with their new dentist. The dentist made a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, which was pretty insensitive. The author then lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's behavior. Making a sexist comment about pain and childbirth is definitely inappropriate. That's a problem, and the dentist should be held accountable. But then the author's response was to lie about being sterile. While the dentist was wrong, retaliating with a lie that's meant to hurt could also be seen as crossing a line.\n\nThe author's mom is upset, and the author thinks it was funny. The key here is whether the author's response was a justified form of retribution or an asshole move. Even if the dentist was an ass, the author's action might be seen as mean-spirited. Lying to hurt someone in that context isn't nice. Also, the author wanted to make the dentist feel bad, which is more about revenge than standing up for themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, the dentist's comment was offensive, so the author had a reason to be angry. But does that justify the response? Maybe not. The author could have addressed the issue without being dishonest. The lie could have been hurtful beyond just making the dentist uncomfortable. Sterility is a sensitive topic for many, so the author's comment could be seen as cruel, even if it's a lie.\n\nSo, the dentist was wrong first, but the author's reaction might be over the top. People often make snap decisions when angry, but that doesn't excuse the action. The author's intent was to retaliate, which might make them the asshole in the eyes of others. The mom's reaction supports that the author went too far. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
