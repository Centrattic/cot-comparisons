What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to a new dentist recommended by their mom after a bad experience with a previous one. The dentist, who was a jerk, made a sexist comment about women needing to get used to pain because of childbirth. The author, who is very sensitive to pain, lied and told the dentist that they can't have kids, which made him uncomfortable. The mom was shocked, the dentist apologized, and the author thinks it was funny and justified.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author's response was appropriate. The dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate and sexist, which is a big issue. The author's retort was a lie but was intended to make the dentist feel bad. Now, is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the dentist's comment was unprofessional and discriminatory. The author had a right to be upset. However, lying to the dentist about being sterile to make him uncomfortable might be seen as crossing a line. While the comment was wrong, using a personal lie to retaliate could be considered unprofessional or even unethical. The author could have addressed the issue in a different way, like reporting the comment or leaving a review, instead of directly confronting the dentist with a false statement. \n\nBut then, the dentist's behavior was inexcusable. If the author felt that there was no recourse and wanted to teach the dentist a lesson, maybe their intent was understandable. However, the method of lying might not be the best approach. Also, the dentist did apologize after the confrontation, which might indicate that the author's action had an effect. But lying could be seen as a form of retaliation that's not professional, even if the original comment was offensive.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the dentist's comment is definitely in the wrong. But the author's response, while understandable in anger, might not be the right approach. The key here is whether the author's action was a justified response to the dentist's unprofessionalism. While the dentist's remark was inexcusable, the author's lie could be seen as taking it too far. The author could have left the office, filed a complaint, or not engaged in the lie. The lie might be a way to assert their own voice, but it could also be seen as a form of bullying or revenge.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because, while the dentist's comment was unacceptable, the author's response of lying to make the dentist uncomfortable is not an appropriate or ethical way to handle the situation. Retaliation with a lie, even if motivated by the dentist's incorrectness, is unprofessional and could be considered the author's fault."
