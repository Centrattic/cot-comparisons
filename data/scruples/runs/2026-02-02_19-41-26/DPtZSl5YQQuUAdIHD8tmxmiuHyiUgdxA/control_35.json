What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dentist made a comment about needing to get used to pain because of childbirth, which the author found offensive. In response, the author lied about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable. The author's mom is upset, and they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the dentist's comment seems inappropriate. Telling a patient, especially one who's already sensitive about pain, that they need to get used to pain because of giving birth is dismissive and potentially sexist. It's a rude and unprofessional thing to say. The dentist didn't take the patient's concerns about pain seriously, which is a big issue, especially in a medical context where patient comfort is important.\n\nNow, the author's response was to lie about being sterile. That's a personal and sensitive topic. Even if the dentist was rude, using such a lie to retaliate could be seen as crossing a line. The dentist was already unprofessional, but the author's response might have been a knee-jerk reaction. However, the lie caused the dentist to be uncomfortable, which the author might see as justified. \n\nBut here's the thing: in a professional setting, how you handle inappropriate comments matters. The author could have addressed the comment directly by expressing why it was offensive or even reporting the behavior, which would be a more constructive approach. Retaliating with a personal lie might be considered unprofessional and could escalate the situation. \n\nAlso, the author's mom is upset, and the author is questioning their own actions. The key points here are the dentist's unprofessional behavior and the author's method of response. While the dentist was wrong, the author's choice of a personal and potentially hurtful lie might be seen as the wrong approach, even if the intention was to teach the dentist a lesson. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong. The dentist's behavior was inexcusable, but the author's response was not the appropriate way to handle it. The author should have addressed the issue in a more professional manner, perhaps by confronting the comment directly or seeking another dentist without resorting to deceit. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
