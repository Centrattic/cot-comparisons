What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dentist making a gender-based comment about pain during a dental procedure. The author, who is very sensitive to pain, felt wronged by the dentist's remark. In response, the author lied about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable. The mom is upset, but the author thinks it was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's actions. The dentist made a comment that's both gender stereotyping and dismissive of the patient's concern. Saying a woman should get used to pain for childbirth is a harmful stereotype and unprofessional. That's definitely on the dentist.\n\nNow, the author's response was to lie about being sterile. The intent here was to make the dentist feel bad. While the dentist's comment was inappropriate, retaliating with a lie could be seen as crossing a line. The dentist might have been unprofessional, but the patient's response was a personal attack. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and causing harm. The author might have been justified in being upset, but making up a lie to hurt someone else might not be the appropriate way to address the issue. It's important to consider professional boundaries and appropriate conflict resolution. The author could have addressed the issue without personalizing the retaliation. So, while the dentist was in the wrong, the author's action might be seen as the asshole move because it's a harmful and deceptive response. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
