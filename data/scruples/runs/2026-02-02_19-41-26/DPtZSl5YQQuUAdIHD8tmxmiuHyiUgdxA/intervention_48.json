What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the dentist made a sexist comment about women needing to get used to pain because of childbirth, and the author lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate and sexist. The author was sensitive to pain and had a traumatic experience before, so the dentist's remark was offensive. The author then retaliated by lying and making the dentist uncomfortable. The mom is upset, and the author is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. While the dentist's behavior was wrong, the author's response was a lie intended to harm the dentist's feelings. Even if the dentist deserved it for the comment, retaliating with a lie might be considered unprofessional and a form of emotional manipulation. The author crossed a line by making a personal attack, even if it was a lie. The dentist's comment was inappropriate, but the author's response could be seen as escalating the situation in a way that's not constructive. The author could have addressed the issue by leaving, reporting, or expressing their discomfort without resorting to a lie. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their response was a personal attack rather than a professional one.\n"
