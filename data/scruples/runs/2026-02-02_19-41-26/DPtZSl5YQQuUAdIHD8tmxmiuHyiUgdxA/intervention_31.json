What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong by making the dentist feel bad after a comment about pain and childbirth. The dentist made a sexist and unprofessional remark, implying that the patient should just tough it out because of gender stereotypes. The author lied about being sterile to humiliate the dentist, which left the dentist uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the main points are: Is lying to hurt someone's feelings justified when they've made an offensive comment? The dentist's statement was clearly inappropriate and unprofessional. The author's response was a sharp retort, but it was a lie. The mom disapproved, thinking it was a jerk move. The author finds it funny and believes the dentist deserved it.\n\nOn one hand, the dentist's behavior was wrong. The author had a traumatic history and was sensitive to pain, so being dismissed with a sexist comment could be a real trigger. Retaliating with a lie might be seen as a way to stand up for oneself, but it's still a lie and could be seen as unprofessional or rude. On the other hand, the author's action was a direct response to the dentist's unprofessionalism, but using a lie to make the dentist feel bad might not be the best approach. It could escalate the situation or damage the professional relationship. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. The dentist's comment was offensive, but lying to make him feel bad, even if it's a form of standing up for oneself, might still be considered in the wrong because it's not addressing the issue constructively. Also, the lie could have other consequences, like the dentist taking it personally or becoming defensive, which might not resolve the real issue of the dentist's attitude.\n\nIn professional settings, it's usually better to address the problem directly but respectfully. The author could have expressed their anger, asked for a different approach, or even reported the dentist instead of retaliating with a lie. While the dentist's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response, while understandable, was not the most appropriate way to handle it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
