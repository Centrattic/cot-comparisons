What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's very sensitive to pain, had a traumatic experience with a dentist. Their mom recommended a new dentist, but this dentist was dismissive. The dentist even made a gendered comment about needing to get used to pain for childbirth. The author then lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad. The mom is upset, but the author thinks it was justified.\n\nSo, first, the dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate. Making a remark about a patient's gender and childbirth in a medical setting is unprofessional. The author was probably already stressed and hurt from previous bad experiences, so this comment might have been the last straw. But the author's response was to lie and say they can't have kids. While the dentist's behavior was wrong, the author's retaliation could be seen as crossing a line. Lying to hurt someone's feelings might be a form of emotional retaliation. Even if the dentist was in the wrong, the author's action was meant to make him feel bad, which is unkind. However, the dentist's comment was offensive and possibly sexist, so the author might feel justified. But generally, revenge is considered wrong, even if the initial action was bad. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate and appropriate. Lying to hurt someone, even if they said something wrong, is usually seen as the wrong move. The author should have addressed the issue through proper channels, like complaining to the office or finding a new dentist. So, the author is in the wrong because they chose to retaliate in a hurtful way rather than handling it professionally.\n"
