What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for making their dentist feel bad after a rude comment. The dentist said something dismissive about needing to get used to pain, referencing childbirth. The author then lied about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the dentist's comment is definitely inappropriate. Making a gendered comment about pain and childbirth is unprofessional and probably not acceptable. The author's response was to lie, which did make the dentist uncomfortable. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the dentist was in the wrong by making a sexist and dismissive remark. The author had a right to feel upset and wanted to teach the dentist a lesson. But on the other hand, lying to make someone feel bad, even if they said something wrong, could be seen as crossing a line. The author's action was intentional and meant to hurt the dentist's feelings. Even if the dentist was rude, responding with a lie might not be the best way to handle it. The author could have left the practice or complained professionally instead of retaliating personally. The mom's reaction also suggests that the author's response was too harsh. So, even though the dentist was at fault, the author's method of responding might be considered wrong. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
