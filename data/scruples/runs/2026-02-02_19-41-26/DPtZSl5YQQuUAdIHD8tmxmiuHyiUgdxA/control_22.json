What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a dentist making a sexist comment about needing to get used to pain for childbirth, and the patient retaliates by lying about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate and offensive. Making a sexist remark in a professional setting is unprofessional and wrong. The author was in a vulnerable situation due to past trauma and sensitivity to pain, which the dentist didn't take seriously. That's a red flag for the dentist's behavior.\n\nNow, the author's response: lying about being sterile. The intent here was to make the dentist feel bad. The dentist did apologize after the incident, and the mom was shocked. The author found it funny and believes the dentist deserved it as a lesson. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the dentist was in the wrong, retaliating with a lie could be seen as crossing a line. The author's action might be considered unprofessional too, even if the dentist was rude. However, the dentist's comment was the initial wrong, so there's a debate on whether the author's response was justified.\n\nLegally, the dentist's comment is unprofessional, but the author's lie could also be seen as a form of retaliation. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might argue that the author had a right to stand up for herself given the dentist's behavior, while others might say that lying and making a false statement isn't the appropriate response. \n\nThe key points are the dentist's sexist remark and the author's lie. The dentist's behavior is definitely the bigger issue, but the author's action could be seen as equally unprofessional. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer likely depends on whether the response was a justified reaction to the dentist's misconduct. However, using a lie to retaliate, even in the face of unprofessional behavior, might be considered inappropriate. So the author could be in the wrong, but it's a close call. However, the dentist's comment was the primary wrongdoing, so maybe the author isn't the asshole here. But the lie and the intent to hurt could make her the asshole. Hmm."
