What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a dentist making a sexist comment, and the patient lying about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dentist's behavior. He made a comment that's not only dismissive but also sexist, implying that women should just endure pain, especially relating to childbirth. That's clearly inappropriate and unprofessional. So, the dentist is definitely at fault here.\n\nThen the patient responds by lying about being sterile. The intent was to make the dentist feel bad, which the patient did. The author is asking if they're the asshole by thinking they deserved that. The key here is whether the patient's response was justified given the dentist's comment.\n\nOn one hand, the dentist's comment is inexcusable. On the other, the patient's retaliation with a lie might be seen as a form of personal attack rather than a professional one. While the dentist's behavior is wrong, lying to make them uncomfortable could be seen as crossing a line. However, considering the power dynamic in a medical setting and the patient's right to feel safe and respected, some might argue the response was a form of standing up for themselves.\n\nBut the author is being honest here. The dentist's comment was hurtful and unprofessional, and the patient felt justified. However, the lie is a direct personal attack. The question is whether the patient's actions were a reasonable response. The mom's reaction suggests she thought it was wrong, but the patient thinks it was funny.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the main point is if the patient overreacted. The dentist's comment was the initial wrongdoing. The patient's action, while hurtful to the dentist, was a direct response to being made to feel belittled. But lying to the dentist about sterility is a personal lie that might not be the best way to handle the situation. A better response might be to leave or report the behavior, but the patient chose to retaliate in a personal way.\n\nSo, while the dentist was definitely in the wrong, the patient's action of lying to make them feel bad might be seen as also being in the wrong, because it's a personal attack. But the line is blurry here. The patient felt empowered, but it's a question of proportionality. The dentist's comment was unprofessional, but the patient's lie is a form of personal retaliation. So, the patient is in the wrong for lying, even if the dentist's actions were worse. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
