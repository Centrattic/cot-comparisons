What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the dentist made a dismissive comment about the patient's sensitivity to pain, comparing it to childbirth. The author then lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad. The mom is upset, but the author thinks it was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dentist's behavior. The dentist said, \"You are a woman so you need to get used to pain. What are you going to do when you give birth?\" That's definitely inappropriate and unprofessional. Making a comment about someone's gender and comparing their pain to childbirth is a form of sexism. The dentist isn't taking the patient's concerns seriously, which is a problem.\n\nNow, the author's response was to lie about being sterile. The intent was to make the dentist feel bad. While the dentist was in the wrong, the author's retaliation was also unprofessional and possibly hurtful. The lie could have been emotionally damaging to the dentist, even if it was a lie. It's a form of personal attack rather than addressing the issue directly.\n\nThe author's actions might have taught the dentist a lesson, but it's not the right way to handle it. The appropriate response would be to express the offense, perhaps report the comment, or seek another dentist. Retaliating with a personal lie can lead to more problems and isn't a constructive solution.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong because even though the dentist made a bad comment, the author's response was also inappropriate. The right approach would have been to address the issue without crossing the line into personal insults."
