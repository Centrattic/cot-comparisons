What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) was in the wrong when they lied to their dentist to make him feel bad. The dentist made a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, which is pretty offensive and inappropriate. The author, who's very sensitive to pain and had a bad history with dentists, was already on edge. When the dentist said that, the author snapped and lied about being sterile to make him uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the dentist's statement is clearly inappropriate. Making a gender-based comment about pain and childbirth is unprofessional and discriminatory. The author was in a vulnerable situation, having had negative experiences before. That context is important because it shows the author was already stressed and maybe more reactive.\n\nBut then the author's response was to lie and say they can't have kids. That's a personal attack, even if it was in response to something worse. While the dentist's comment was wrong, retaliating with a lie that's meant to shame or hurt him could be seen as crossing a line. The author's goal was to make the dentist feel bad, which is a form of revenge. Even if the dentist deserved it, the question is about whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nThe mom's reaction suggests that she felt the author went too far, even if she didn't say anything. The author might think it was justified, but from an external perspective, the lie was a personal and hurtful response. The dentist did apologize afterwards, so the situation was resolved without escalation. However, the author's action was still unprofessional and potentially cruel. It's a judgment call, but generally, responding to unprofessionalism with personal attacks isn't considered acceptable, even if the initial comment was bad. So the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
