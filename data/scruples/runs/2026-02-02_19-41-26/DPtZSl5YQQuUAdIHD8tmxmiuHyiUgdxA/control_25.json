What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong in this situation. The dentist made a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, which is pretty offensive. The author, who is very sensitive to pain, reacted by lying about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's behavior. His comment is not only sexist but also dismissive of the patient's concerns. That's unprofessional and could be considered harassment. The author felt wronged and used a lie to retaliate. Retaliation can be tricky because it's a form of harm, even if the initial harm was the dentist's fault.\n\nThe author's response was to say they can't have kids, which is a personal and potentially hurtful lie. While the dentist's comment was inappropriate, the author's response might be crossing a line. Lying to make someone else feel bad, even if they were wrong, can be seen as unkind or vengeful. Also, the author's mom is upset, which might indicate that their action had negative consequences beyond the dentist.\n\nBut there's also a context where the author felt disrespected and wanted to stand up for themselves. Maybe they felt empowered to confront the dentist's sexism. However, the method of confrontation was deceptive. Instead of addressing the issue directly or reporting it, they used a lie to cause discomfort. That might not be the most effective or ethical way to handle it.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, lying to retaliate isn't typically encouraged, even if the original action was wrong. The dentist should be held accountable through proper channels, but personal retaliation might not be the best approach. So, the author might be in the wrong for choosing a deceptive and potentially hurtful method to respond.\n"
