What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after making their dentist feel bad. The situation is that the dentist made a comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth, which the author found offensive. The author lied about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable. The mom is upset, but the author thinks it was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the dentist's actions. The dentist's statement seems inappropriate and possibly sexist. Telling a patient, especially a woman, to get used to pain because of childbirth is not professional and could be seen as dismissive. That's a problem, and the dentist should not have made that comment.\n\nThen the author's response. They lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad. While the dentist was in the wrong, the author's retaliation was a lie that could have been hurtful. The dentist was uncomfortable, and the interaction ended with an apology. \n\nNow, the key is whether the author's actions were a justified response. Retaliating with a lie might be seen as crossing a line, even if the initial comment was wrong. The author could have addressed the issue without making up a false statement. Lying to hurt someone, even if they were rude, might be considered unprofessional and potentially harmful, especially in a medical setting. \n\nAlso, the dentist did later apologize, which might indicate he realized his mistake. The author's lie could have been unnecessary once an apology was given. Additionally, the author's mom is upset, which adds to the family conflict. \n\nSo, even though the dentist was in the wrong, the author's response might not be justified. The lie could be seen as taking the situation too far, making the author at least partially responsible for escalating the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong."
