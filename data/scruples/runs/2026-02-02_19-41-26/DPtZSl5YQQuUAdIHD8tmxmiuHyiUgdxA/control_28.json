What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by making their dentist feel bad after a comment about pain and childbirth. The dentist made a gendered remark, implying that since the patient is a woman, she should just deal with the pain because giving birth is worse. The author then lies about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable. \n\nFirst, the dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate. Making a remark about a patient's gender and linking it to childbirth pain is unprofessional and dismissive. The patient has a history of switching dentists due to not taking pain seriously, so this comment adds insult to injury.\n\nThe author's response was to lie about being sterile, which was intended to make the dentist feel bad. The dentist did apologize after, and the situation ended there. Now, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the dentist's comment was offensive and unprofessional, so the author had valid reasons for being upset. Retaliating with a lie might be seen as a form of self-defense or standing up for themselves. On the other hand, lying to make someone feel bad could be considered unprofessional or rude. However, given the context of the dentist's inappropriate behavior, the author's response might be seen as a justified reaction to being disrespected.\n\nBut then, is it ever okay to lie in a professional setting? The dentist's comment was inexcusable, but retaliating with a lie might escalate the situation unnecessarily. The author could have left the practice or filed a complaint instead. However, the lie was a direct response to the dentist's sexist comment, so it's a form of pushing back against that behavior.\n\nThe key points are the dentist's unprofessional conduct and the author's proportionality in response. The lie was a personal attack but perhaps a reasonable reaction given the context. The author might not be in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, since the dentist apologized and the author's action was a direct response to the sexist remark, it's possible that the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
