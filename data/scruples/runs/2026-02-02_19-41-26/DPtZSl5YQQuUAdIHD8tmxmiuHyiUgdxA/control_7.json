What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a dentist making a sexist comment, and the author lying about being sterile to make him feel bad. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dentist's actions. He said something like \"You're a woman so you need to get used to pain. What are you going to do when you give birth?\" That's definitely inappropriate. It's sexist and dismissive, which is a problem. The author has a history of switching dentists due to pain concerns, so this was another bad experience.\n\nNow, the author's response was to lie about being sterile to make the dentist uncomfortable. The dentist did apologize afterward. The author's mom is upset, but the author thinks it was justified because the dentist deserved it. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but ethically? The dentist's comment was wrong, but retaliating by lying about being sterile could be seen as crossing a line. The author's intent was to make the dentist feel bad, which is a form of revenge. While the dentist's behavior was unacceptable, the author's response might not be the best way to handle it. It's possible that the author could have addressed the issue more constructively, like reporting the comment through proper channels. Lying to hurt someone's feelings might be seen as unprofessional, even if the dentist was in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was a mean retaliation but perhaps not the worst. However, in terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The dentist was definitely at fault for the sexist remark, but the author's response might still be seen as inconsiderate or unprofessional. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the dentist was wrong, the author's method of response could be seen as inappropriate. Alternatively, some might argue it's justified given the dentist's behavior. But generally, retaliating with a lie is usually seen as the wrong approach, so A is likely the answer.\n"
