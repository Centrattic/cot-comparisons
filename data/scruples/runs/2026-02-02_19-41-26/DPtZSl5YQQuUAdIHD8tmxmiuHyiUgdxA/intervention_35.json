What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to a new dentist after previous bad experiences, but this dentist made a sexist comment about women needing to get used to pain for childbirth. The author lied about being sterile to make the dentist feel bad, which the mother disapproved of.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dentist's actions. The dentist made a sexist and dismissive comment, which is unprofessional and inappropriate. That's clearly wrong. The author felt targeted and disrespected, which is understandable. However, the author's response was to lie about being sterile to retaliate. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author's retaliation makes them the asshole. On one hand, the dentist's behavior was inexcusable. On the other, the author's response was to deceive and humiliate the dentist, which could be seen as a form of revenge. \n\nBut in professional settings, even if someone acts poorly, the appropriate response is usually to address the issue through proper channels or leave a review, not to retaliate in a deceptive manner. The author's lie could be seen as crossing a line, even if motivated by justified anger. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as a form of tit-for-tat, but it's a personal attack rather than addressing the professional misconduct. Also, lying to cause someone discomfort can be considered unethical, regardless of the provocation. \n\nHowever, the dentist's initial comment was a clear violation of professional conduct. The author might feel that there was no other recourse, especially if they felt the system wouldn't support them. But still, the lie and the intent to make the dentist feel bad is a personal vendetta. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while understandable in context, are still inconsiderate and unprofessional. The dentist's behavior was worse, but the author's response still makes them the asshole in this scenario. The key is whether the retaliation is proportionate and appropriate. Since it's a lie intended to humiliate, it's likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
