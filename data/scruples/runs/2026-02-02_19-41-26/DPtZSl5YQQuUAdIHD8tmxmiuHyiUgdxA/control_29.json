What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is very sensitive to pain, had a bad experience with a dentist who dismissed their concerns and made a gendered comment about needing to get used to pain for childbirth. The author then lied to the dentist, saying they can't have kids, to make him feel bad. The mom is upset, and the author is unsure if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dentist's actions. He said something inappropriate, linking a woman's ability to handle pain to childbirth, which is a gender stereotype and dismissive of the patient's legitimate concerns. That's definitely unprofessional and possibly sexist. The author felt wronged and wanted to retaliate.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their response. The author lied to the dentist to hurt his feelings. While the dentist's behavior was unacceptable, the author's response was to deceive and humiliate him. This could be seen as crossing a line. Even if the dentist deserved it, intentionally making someone feel bad through deception might not be the right approach. The author could have addressed the issue through proper channels, like reporting the behavior or not returning to the dentist, instead of personal retaliation.\n\nAlso, the impact on others: the mom is upset, and the author's action might have affected the dentist's professional reputation unjustly. The author might have valid reasons for feeling upset, but the method of retaliation could be considered inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because while the dentist was at fault, the author's response was not justified."
