What are you going to do when you give birth.\"\nI have changed 2 other dentists that dont take patient pain seriously, but I have never gotten this reaction before, I was furious.\nI really wanted to make him feel bad so I look at him and say \"Wow thanks, I can't have kids! \". (Total lie) \nHe was obviously uncomfortable and my mom's jaw dropped, but she kept quiet. \nWe ended the consultation there after he apologized and my mom told me I was a total jerk and I dident have to do that.\nI think it was funny and I think he will think twice before being smug with other clients. \nAm I the asshole for thinking he deserved that ? \n\nTL;DR Dentist says I need to get used to pain for when I give birth and I lie and tell him I'm sterile, to make him feel bad. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their dentist feel bad. The situation involves the dentist making a sexist comment about needing to get used to pain for childbirth, and the author lying about being sterile to retaliate.\n\nFirst, the dentist's comment is clearly inappropriate. He's making a generalized, sexist remark that's not professional. The author was already sensitive to pain and had a traumatic history, which makes this comment even more hurtful. \n\nNow, the author's response was to lie about being sterile. The dentist was uncomfortable and the consultation ended. The mom is upset, but the author thinks it was justified. The key here is whether the author's action was an appropriate response to the dentist's unprofessional behavior.\n\nRetaliation in this case is a bit of a gray area. While the dentist was wrong, the author's lie could be seen as a form of justified self-defense or a way to stand up for themselves. However, lying to make someone feel bad might not be the best approach, even if the initial comment was offensive. The dentist's comment was unprofessional, but the author's response could have been handled in a more constructive way, like reporting the comment or not engaging in a personal attack.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's sensitivity and past trauma add context. They might have felt wronged and used a sharp retort to convey their hurt. But the lie is a deliberate deception, which could be seen as crossing a line. The dentist might have deserved a firm response, but the method used by the author could be considered a bit harsh or unprofessional in return.\n\nSo, considering all angles, while the dentist made a bad comment, the author's response, although understandable in the moment, might be seen as wrong because it involved deception and personal retaliation rather than a professional response. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
