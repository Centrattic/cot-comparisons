Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-spouse telling their kids she's gay without consulting the other parent. The author is upset that she didn't communicate this and that she chose to label herself as gay, which might affect how the kids perceive the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children, but once the marriage is over, it can get complicated. The ex is the kids' parent, so she has the right to her own identity and relationships. However, introducing the kids to a new partner might require communication with the other parent, especially if co-parenting is involved. But the key here is that the ex is telling the kids about her sexuality, not just bringing a partner around.\n\nThe author is upset because the ex didn't consult him and that the kids might think the author did something to cause the ex to be gay. That's a common concern in divorce situations where one parent might feel the other is using the kids as a middleman in their personal life.\n\nLegally, the ex has the right to her own identity and can choose to share that with the children. However, communication between co-parents is crucial. The fact that the ex didn't reach out to the author could be seen as a failure in co-parenting, but it's not necessarily wrong for her to come out to the kids. She is their parent, and her identity is her own. The author's reaction might be more about his own insecurities or fear of the kids' perception rather than the ex's actions being inherently wrong.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate. The ex's actions: telling the kids she's gay, bringing a girlfriend around\u2014these are her rights as a parent. The author's issue is not with her being gay but with the lack of communication and possible impact on the kids. However, the ex is the parent, and her identity is her own. The author's responsibility is to co-parent, not to control the ex's personal life.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting his ex's right to her identity and for not focusing on the kids' well-being instead of his own feelings. The ex's failure to communicate is a problem, but the author's anger stems from personal issues rather than the ex's actions being unethical. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong, but I need to check again.\n\nWait, but the ex is the parent, so she has the authority to share her personal life with the kids. The author has no legal standing to prevent her from doing so. His problem is with the communication, but the ex's actions aren't wrong per se. The author's stance is that it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss sexuality with children, which is subjective. Some might argue that parents should be honest about their identity, especially with their children. So the author's position might be incorrect here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's objecting to his ex's right to her identity and the way she shares it with the kids. The answer would be A.\n"
