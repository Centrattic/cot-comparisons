Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-spouse who, after a ten-year divorce, came out as gay to their kids without consulting the author. The author feels blindsided and is upset about the kids' possible confusion and the lack of communication. The ex only responded by saying not to text during parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of co-parenting post-divorce. Even after a contentious divorce, co-parents usually need to communicate, especially regarding the children's well-being. The ex's action of introducing a new partner into the kids' lives might be seen as significant, especially if done without prior discussion. The author is concerned about how the kids might perceive their father, thinking the mother is now gay, which could lead to them questioning their father's sexuality or the validity of their parents' previous marriage. That's a legitimate worry.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions that the ex didn't date much post-divorce while he had two long-term girlfriends. This might imply a sense of hypocrisy, but that doesn't necessarily make the ex wrong. The key issue here is whether the ex had a right to share her sexual orientation with the kids without consulting the other parent. In many cases, parents do discuss their sexuality with their children, especially as part of their identity, but the approach matters. The ex might have thought it was necessary for her own honesty and the kids' understanding of her identity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction is about the process\u2014feeling that the ex should have discussed it with him first. The problem is whether the ex had an obligation to do so. In co-parenting situations, major life decisions that affect the children, such as introducing a new partner, usually require communication. But coming out as gay is also a personal identity issue, which might be something the ex felt needed to address directly with the kids. However, the lack of prior communication from the author's side is a red flag. The ex's response of not engaging further is unhelpful, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong for seeking an explanation.\n\nThe author's main point is about the unilateral decision without consultation, which is a valid concern in co-parenting. The ex's approach might have been abrupt, but the author's reaction is to ask if he's in the wrong. The question is whether the act of coming out to the kids without prior discussion makes the ex wrong, which could shift responsibility away from the author. However, the author's anger stems from not being informed, which is a common point of conflict in shared parenting. \n\nI need to weigh the importance of the ex's right to personal expression and the children's right to know their parent's identity against the co-parent's right to be informed. In many cases, co-parents are expected to inform each other about matters affecting the children. The ex might have assumed that as a parent, she could discuss her identity with her children independently, but in a shared custody situation, it's usually better to communicate. The fact that the ex didn't engage further complicates things, but the author's original action was to seek an explanation, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to discuss the matter. The ex's unilateral decision is problematic, but the author's response of seeking an explanation is justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
