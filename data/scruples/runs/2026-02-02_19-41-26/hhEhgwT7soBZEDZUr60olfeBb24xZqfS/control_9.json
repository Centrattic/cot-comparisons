Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the ex-spouse told the kids she's gay without consulting the author, and now he's upset about it. The key points here are the age of the kids, communication between the exes, and whether the ex had a right to make that disclosure.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have three kids, but doesn't specify their ages. The age is important because if they're minors, especially teenagers or younger, the parent's decision to come out to them might be seen as appropriate, especially if the kids are old enough to understand. If they're very young, maybe it's not suitable yet.\n\nThe ex didn't consult the author, which is a point of contention. But in a divorce scenario, each parent typically has the right to make decisions regarding their children, unless there's a custody arrangement that limits that. If the ex has custody or parenting time, she might have the right to share her personal information with the kids during her time with them. However, the author might feel blindsided, especially if the kids are young and this could affect their perception of the author's past marriage.\n\nThe author is upset that his ex didn't check with him. But in many cases, unless there's a legal agreement requiring consultation on such matters, the ex isn't obligated to discuss this with the other parent. The ex's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful, but maybe she felt it was her right to be honest with the kids.\n\nThe author is also worried about the kids' perception of him, thinking she's gay instead of bisexual. That might imply that the author is uncomfortable with the kids knowing the ex's sexuality, possibly because he wants to avoid any stigma or confusion. However, the ex's sexuality is her own business, and if she's in a relationship now, she might feel it's important to be truthful with the children.\n\nThe author's approach via text and then demanding an explanation might be seen as confrontational. Instead of addressing the kids' needs directly, he's focusing on his own feelings about the disclosure. The ex's refusal to answer could be because she believes it's her personal choice, and the author's method of communication might not be effective.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents usually have the right to share their personal lives with their children during their custody time. The author's reaction might stem from his own insecurities or the past divorce's nastiness. The children's well-being is important, so open communication is generally encouraged. However, the manner in which the ex handled the situation could be improved by discussing it with the co-parent first, but it's not necessarily her fault if there's no legal requirement for consultation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the ex's actions might be within her rights. The main issue is the lack of communication and the dismissive response. The author isn't wrong for wanting to discuss it, but the ex isn't wrong for making the disclosure. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
