Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex and the author are divorced, and they don't get along well. The ex didn't talk to the author before telling their kids she's gay and is now bringing her girlfriend around. The author is upset because he thinks this might be confusing for the kids and he feels it's not appropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with their children. He confronted her, but she didn't respond.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is wrong. From a general perspective, parents usually have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, including their own personal matters. However, when it comes to co-parenting, communication is key. The ex didn't consult the other parent, which could be an issue. But does that mean the author is in the wrong for being upset? Or is the ex in the wrong for not discussing it first?\n\nThe author mentions that the ex didn't consult him and he's worried about what the kids think. But the ex is their parent, so she might have the right to express her identity to her children. However, depending on the kids' ages and the situation, maybe the author should have been informed. But is it the author's place to object? If the ex is being honest about her identity, that's a personal right. However, the way she did it without discussing with the other parent could be problematic in a co-parenting context.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is upset and thinks the ex is wrong for not consulting him. However, the ex is a parent too, and her sexuality is her own. Unless there's a legal agreement stating otherwise, the ex might have the right to share that information with the kids. The author's main issue is the lack of communication and the potential impact on the kids. But does that make the author in the wrong? If the ex is honest and the kids are old enough, maybe she's correct in sharing her identity. The author's reaction might be more about his own insecurities or the way she handled it, not necessarily her right to come out.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for being upset about the lack of communication, but the ex isn't necessarily wrong for sharing her identity. However, the author's main issue is the lack of consultation. But if the ex is a parent, she has a right to her personal life. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but the ex might have made a mistake in not talking first. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
