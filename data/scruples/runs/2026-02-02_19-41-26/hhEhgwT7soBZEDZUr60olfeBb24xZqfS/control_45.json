Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for being upset that their ex came out as gay to their kids without discussing it first. The situation is that the ex didn't consult them and now brings her girlfriend around the kids. The author feels blindsided and is concerned about the kids' perception of them and their past marriage. The ex didn't respond to their texts beyond scheduling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of co-parenting. When parents are separated, especially after a contentious divorce, communication is key. The author's ex made a significant personal disclosure to the kids without consulting the other parent. While a parent's sexual orientation is a personal matter, when it comes to co-parenting, sharing such information with children might require mutual agreement, especially if it affects the children's understanding of their family structure.\n\nThe author's concern about how the kids perceive their marriage and themselves is valid. If the ex portrayed herself as gay, the kids might have questions about their father's role or the parents' past relationship. The ex not discussing this with the author could lead to confusion or inconsistency in how the kids receive information about their family. \n\nHowever, the author's approach to confronting the ex via text might have been abrupt. The ex's response about not discussing during parenting time unless it's scheduling might indicate a boundary. But the author's demand for an explanation could be seen as overstepping if the ex is within her rights to share her identity with the children. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the ex's unilateral decision to share personal information affecting the children and the author's reaction. Since the ex didn't consult, but the author is upset about being excluded from that decision, the fault isn't entirely on one side. However, in co-parenting situations, both should ideally communicate about major family matters. The ex being unresponsive isn't helping, but the initial act of not discussing the disclosure could be seen as her fault. \n\nSo, considering that, the author isn't wrong for being upset, and the ex's actions might be the issue. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
