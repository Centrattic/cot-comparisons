Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-partner who told their kids that she's gay without consulting the author. The author is upset because the ex didn't discuss this with him first and is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children, especially if they have joint custody. However, the ex might believe that as a parent, she has the right to share her personal life with the kids. But the author is upset because this revelation might affect the kids' perception of their father or the previous marriage.\n\nThe key points here are communication and the children's well-being. The ex didn't consult the other parent, which can be problematic if it's a significant life change. However, a parent's sexual orientation is generally considered their personal business, and it's not uncommon for parents to come out to their children. The author's objection might stem from feelings of betrayal or concern about how the kids will react, but it's not necessarily the ex's fault for being honest about her identity.\n\nThe author then confronts the ex via text, but she doesn't respond beyond scheduling. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for being upset or if she's wrong for not consulting him. The ex's actions might be seen as her right to live her life, but she could also be at fault for not discussing it with the co-parent, especially if there's a history of a difficult divorce.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have valid points. The author wants to co-parent effectively but feels blindsided. The ex might believe she has the right to her identity and to be open with the kids. However, the way she presented her sexuality as \"gay\" instead of bisexual might be a point of contention if the author feels it's misleading or harmful.\n\nLegally, there's no clear-cut answer, but ethically, the ex should have considered the co-parent's input, especially if it could affect the children's perception of their father. However, the author also has an obligation to respect the ex's identity. The author's anger might be more about the method of disclosure rather than the content. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the lack of communication, but the ex might not be in the wrong for coming out to the children. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author's concern is about communication and potential impact on the kids, which is valid. The ex made a decision without consulting the co-parent, which is a mistake, but the author isn't wrong to be upset. So the answer is B.\n"
