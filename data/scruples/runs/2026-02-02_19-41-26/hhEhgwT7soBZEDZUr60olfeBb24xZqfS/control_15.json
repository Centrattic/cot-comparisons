Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-couple with three kids. The ex told the kids she's gay and is bringing her girlfriend around them without consulting the author. The author is upset because they think it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children, and they feel blindsided.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex didn't consult the author, which is a point the author is emphasizing. The author is also concerned about the kids' reactions and how they might perceive their previous marriage. The ex's response was dismissive, focusing only on scheduling during parenting time.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics and co-parenting etiquette. Typically, when parents are separated but share custody, it's important to communicate about major decisions affecting the children. Introducing a new partner or disclosing personal information like sexual orientation might be considered a significant change that the other parent should be informed about, especially if it impacts the children.\n\nBut wait, in some cases, parents might have the right to their own identity and relationships. However, the method of disclosure here seems abrupt. The ex didn't consult the other parent, which can be seen as a failure to co-parent effectively. The author is concerned about the kids' well-being and the potential confusion, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe author's argument is that discussing sexuality with kids is not appropriate. However, some might argue that if the ex is in a relationship, the kids might notice her girlfriend and need some explanation. The ex's choice to frame it as \"gay\" instead of bisexual could be a personal decision, but the author feels betrayed, thinking the kids might misunderstand.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is upset because they weren't consulted, but they also have a history of a long, nasty divorce. Their own actions (having two long-term girlfriends) might contrast with their disapproval of their ex's actions. However, the main issue here is communication. The ex didn't reach out, which is a problem in co-parenting. The author's right to have input might be valid, but so is the ex's right to her identity.\n\nBut from a co-parenting standpoint, the ex should have discussed this with the other parent. So the ex is at fault here for not communicating. The author isn't wrong for being upset if they were excluded from a major decision affecting the kids. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the ex didn't communicate properly, even if the author has their own flaws.\n"
