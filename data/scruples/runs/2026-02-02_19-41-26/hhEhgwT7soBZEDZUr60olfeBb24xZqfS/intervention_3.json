      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-spouse told their kids she's gay and brought her girlfriend around them without consulting the author. The author is upset about this and thinks the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The divorce was over ten years ago and was nasty. They don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term relationships. The ex told the kids she's gay, not bisexual, which might be implying something about the author's past marriage. The author is concerned about how the kids are perceiving this and thinks it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nThe ex didn't consult the author or warn him, and when he confronted her via text, she only mentioned not texting during parenting time unless it's about scheduling. He then sent another text demanding an explanation, but she didn't respond. The author is asking if he's at fault here.\n\nNow, thinking about the rights of each parent. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions regarding their children's upbringing, including matters of their own lifestyle or relationships, as long as it's in the child's best interest. However, if there's a co-parenting agreement or if one parent is using the other's past (like implying the author's marriage was based on a lie if she's now saying she's gay), that could be problematic.\n\nThe author is upset because the ex chose to label herself as gay, not bisexual, which might suggest that the previous marriage wasn't based on the ex's true orientation. The kids might be confused or upset by this revelation. The author feels blindsided and not consulted, which is a valid concern in co-parenting situations where communication is key.\n\nBut, the ex has the right to her own identity and to be open about it. If she's now in a relationship with a woman and wants to introduce that to the kids, it's her right as a parent. However, she should have discussed this with the co-parent, especially if there's a history of conflict. The fact that she didn't consult him could be seen as inconsiderate, but if there's already a strained relationship, it's possible she felt it necessary to act on her own.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. But children need to understand their parent's identity, and if the parent is in a new relationship, it's part of their life that the kids should be aware of. The way it was handled\u2014without prior discussion\u2014might be the main issue here, not the act of coming out itself.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The ex didn't consult him, which is a problem in co-parenting. However, the ex has the right to her identity and relationships. The author's reaction is about feeling blindsided and concerned about the kids' perception. But is he wrong for being upset about this? Probably not. However, is he in the wrong for holding the ex accountable for not discussing it first? Maybe not. The ex's actions were inconsiderate, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. The key is that both parents should communicate about major life changes affecting the children. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the ex's actions were within her rights and the author's main issue is about the lack of communication, then maybe the ex is at fault. But the author might be overreacting or projecting his own insecurities. Hmm. But given the information, the author isn't wrong for wanting to discuss it with the ex. The ex not responding is also problematic. So the answer is B.\n"
