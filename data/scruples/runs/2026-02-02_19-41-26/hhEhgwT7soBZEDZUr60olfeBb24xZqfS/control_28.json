She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex-spouse coming out as gay to their kids without consulting the other parent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The ex and the author had a nasty divorce ten years ago because the author \"fucked up.\" They don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex told the kids she's gay and brings her girlfriend around without talking to the author first. The author is upset because the kids might think he's responsible for the ex being gay and that the marriage failed because of that. The ex didn't explain her actions and just focused on scheduling during parenting time.\n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the ex was wrong to inform the kids about her sexuality without consulting the author. The author feels it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. But wait, in many cases, parents do talk to their kids about their relationships and personal life, especially as they grow older. However, this is a shared custody situation, so both parents are involved in the kids' lives. The ex didn't communicate with the author, which is a problem because the kids are part of both parents' lives.\n\nAnother point is the author's own relationships. He has had two long-term girlfriends since the divorce. If the ex is now in a relationship, maybe it's only fair to discuss it with the kids, but the author might feel there's a double standard. However, the way the ex handled it\u2014just dropping it without discussion\u2014might not be the best approach. The author's reaction is understandable, but is he in the wrong?\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author is upset about the lack of communication and the possible impact on the kids. The ex's actions could be seen as not considering the co-parenting relationship. However, the author also had a role in the failed marriage. The ex didn't consult him, which is a breach of co-parenting etiquette. The author isn't wrong for being upset, but is he in the wrong for thinking the ex should have discussed it? Probably not. The ex is wrong for not communicating. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
