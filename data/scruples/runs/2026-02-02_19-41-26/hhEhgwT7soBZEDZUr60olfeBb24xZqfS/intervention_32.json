Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original post) is at fault for being upset that their ex came out as gay to the kids without prior discussion. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their ex had a bad divorce a decade ago. They don't get along well but manage to co-parent three kids. The ex hasn't dated much since the split, while the author has had two long-term girlfriends. Now, the ex told the kids she's gay and started bringing her girlfriend around. The author is upset because this was done without consultation and worries about the kids' perception. The ex didn't respond to the author's texts and calls.\n\nThe author's main points are: 1) The ex didn't consult them before coming out to the kids. 2) The ex chose to label as gay instead of bisexual, which might confuse the kids about the author's sexuality. 3) They feel it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss sexuality with children. The ex's response was dismissive, only talking about scheduling during parenting time.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is upset about lack of communication. But wait, in co-parenting situations, especially after a contentious divorce, communication issues are common. The author might feel blindsided, but the ex has a right to her identity. However, introducing a new partner or discussing her sexuality with the kids could be a sensitive matter. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The ex's decision to come out to the kids might be her personal choice, but involving the kids without the other parent's input could be problematic. On the other hand, the author's marriage ended years ago, and the ex's sexuality is her own. The author's concern about the kids' perception is valid, but the ex might feel it's her role as a parent to be open about her identity. \n\nThe author's argument that the ex didn't consult them is a point against the ex. However, the author also has a history of not getting along. The ex's dismissive response doesn't help. But the core issue is whether the ex had the right to make that decision without discussing it. In many cases, parents are encouraged to discuss such matters with the co-parent, especially regarding children's well-being. So the ex might have a responsibility to communicate, even if the relationship is strained. \n\nThe author's claim that they don't think it's acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children is a bit problematic. Parents often discuss their personal lives with kids depending on their age, but maybe it's not appropriate to do it in a way that could confuse them. The ex might have handled it poorly. \n\nPutting it all together: The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset about not being consulted. The ex might be wrong for not discussing it, but the author's approach of confronting via text and not getting a response might be part of the communication issues from the divorce. However, the author's statement that they don't think it's acceptable for parents to discuss their sexuality with children is a bit extreme. It's probably a situation where both parties have some responsibility. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the answer is B (they are not in the wrong), because the ex should have discussed it with them, especially for the kids' sake.\n"
