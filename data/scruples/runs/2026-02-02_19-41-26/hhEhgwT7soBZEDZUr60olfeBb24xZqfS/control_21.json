Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong when their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're divorced, had a bad split ten years ago. The ex is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids and told them she's gay. The author is upset because they weren't consulted and think it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. The ex didn't respond to the author's texts beyond scheduling.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's main points are about being blindsided and the potential impact on the kids. They also mention the divorce was nasty, which might affect their current relationship. The ex, on the other hand, might feel that as a parent, she has the right to live her life and share her identity with the kids. Also, the author's ex might see this as her personal choice, especially if she's been single for a while and is now in a relationship.\n\nBut then, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key here might be whether the ex had a duty to consult the co-parent. In many custody situations, especially when children are involved, parents are expected to communicate major decisions. However, a parent's sexual orientation might be considered a personal matter. But when it comes to involving the kids, like introducing a partner, that's usually a co-parenting decision.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for being upset because the ex didn't discuss this with them. However, the ex's right to live her life and share her identity with her children could be a counterpoint. The author's reaction is understandable, but if the ex is being a parent to the kids, she might have a right to share her life with them. Still, introducing a new partner might require some level of communication with the other parent, especially if it affects the children's environment.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the kids are thinking about their marriage. If the ex chose to say she's gay, maybe the kids are questioning the father's sexuality, which could be a problem. But that's more about the kids' perspective than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nThe ex's lack of communication (only responding to schedule) might indicate she's not engaging in a cooperative parenting approach, which could be her fault. The author is asking if they're at fault for being upset. Since the ex didn't consult them and might have overstepped by discussing her sexuality with the kids without the author's input, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The responsibility might lie with the ex for not collaborating on parenting decisions.\n"
