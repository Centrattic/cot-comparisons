Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a father) is in the wrong for being upset that his ex-wife told their kids she's gay without consulting him. The author feels that his ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with their children and is upset that she didn't seek his input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children, especially regarding their upbringing. However, when parents are divorced, there's usually a custody or parenting plan in place. If the ex is in her parenting time, she might have the right to interact with the kids as she sees fit, unless there are specific court orders restricting that. \n\nBut the main issue here is about the ex disclosing her sexuality to the children without consulting the other parent. The author is upset not just about the disclosure itself but also about the lack of communication. The kids are now being told their mother is gay, which might lead them to question why their father was married to a woman who identifies as gay. The author is concerned about the children's understanding and the potential confusion.\n\nIn terms of ethics, sharing personal information about one's sexual orientation with children can be a sensitive topic. It might depend on the children's age and maturity level. If the kids are old enough to understand, perhaps it's appropriate, but the method and timing matter. However, the ex might have a right to her own identity and the right to share it with her children. \n\nThe author's stance is that he didn't get a say, which is valid in terms of co-parenting communication. However, the ex might argue that she has the right to share her identity with her children. The problem here is the lack of communication, not necessarily the act of coming out. The author is upset because he wasn't consulted, but in co-parenting situations, both parents usually have rights to make decisions unless there's a legal agreement otherwise.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the ex is within her rights as a parent to share her sexuality during her parenting time, then the author might be in the wrong for expecting to have a say in this. However, the author's concern is valid in terms of the children's understanding of the situation. It's possible that the author should have been included in the conversation, especially if there's a shared custody arrangement where both parents are supposed to coordinate.\n\nBut given that the ex is bringing her girlfriend around the kids, maybe the disclosure was necessary to explain her partner's presence. The author might need to address his feelings about the disclosure but also consider the ex's rights as a parent. The key here is whether the ex had a responsibility to consult him. If there's no legal requirement for such communication, then she might not be in the wrong. However, the way she handled it (not responding to texts) could be problematic.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but if the ex is exercising her parental rights without violating any agreements, then she might not be at fault either. The answer likely depends on the specific custody arrangement and cultural norms. However, in many cases, co-parents are expected to discuss major changes, so the ex could be at fault for not communicating, but the author might not be in the wrong for wanting to be consulted.\n"
