Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their ex told their kids she's gay without discussing it first.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex and author split 10 years ago, had a bad divorce, and now co-parent three kids. The ex decided to come out as gay to their children without consulting the author. The author feels blindsided and is worried about how the kids perceive him and their marriage. The ex brought her girlfriend around the kids too, but didn't discuss it with the author. The ex's only response was about scheduling during parenting time, not addressing the issue.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author is upset because their ex made a significant life decision that affects the children without discussing it. The author's concern is about the children's well-being and their own feelings about the situation. The ex's response was dismissive, not engaging in the conversation about the children's adjustment.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have a right to be involved in decisions affecting the children. The ex's action might be seen as not considering the co-parent's role. However, the ex is also entitled to her own identity and relationships. But the method of disclosure is key here. Introducing a new partner to children without the co-parent's input could be problematic, especially if it's a sudden change.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for feeling that the ex should have discussed this. The ex's failure to communicate could be a mistake. The author's main issue is that their ex didn't consult them, which is a valid concern in co-parenting. The author isn't opposing the ex's sexuality but the method of disclosure. The ex's refusal to address the issue beyond scheduling shows a lack of cooperation.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the ex didn't involve the author in a decision that affects the children, and the author's reaction is about the children's adjustment and his own feelings, not the ex's sexuality itself.\n"
