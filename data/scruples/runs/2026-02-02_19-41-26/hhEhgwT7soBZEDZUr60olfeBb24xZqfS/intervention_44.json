She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being upset that their ex came out as gay to their kids without discussing it first.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex-spouse and the parent split 10 years ago after a difficult divorce. They have three kids. The ex hasn't dated much, while the parent has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex decided to tell the kids she's gay and brought her girlfriend around them without consulting the parent. The parent is upset, thinking the kids might think negatively about their marriage and finds it unacceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nThe parent confronted the ex via text, but the ex only responded about scheduling, not the issue. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA) or if the ex is wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. The possible answers are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nHmm. Let's consider legal and ethical perspectives. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions regarding their children, including their own personal matters. However, when it comes to a child's well-being, it's often considered best practice to communicate with the co-parent, especially about significant personal decisions that affect the child.\n\nThe ex coming out to the kids is a personal choice. However, if the ex is the legal parent, they have the right to make such decisions. The parent's issue isn't with the ex being gay per se, but with the lack of consultation and the potential impact on the children. \n\nBut is it the parent's responsibility to be consulted? If the family is co-parenting, collaboration is important. The parent might feel blindsided, especially if the kids are still young or not prepared for this information. However, the ex's sexuality isn't something that should be hidden if the ex is being honest about it. \n\nThe ex's response of not addressing the parent's concerns via text might be problematic, as effective co-parenting requires communication. But the act of the ex coming out to the kids isn't inherently wrong. The parent's reaction might be more about feeling excluded and concerned about the kids' perception of their marriage.\n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both parties have some responsibility. The ex should have communicated, and the parent's reaction might be overstepping if the ex's decision doesn't harm the kids. However, the parent's main argument is about the kids' understanding and the ex's decision-making without input.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The parent is upset because the ex didn't consult them. Legally, unless there's a custody agreement that dictates such decisions, the ex can share personal information about themselves with the kids. However, ethically, co-parents should communicate about matters affecting the children. The key here is whether the ex's action directly impacts the children's well-being or their relationship with the parent.\n\nIf the ex is being honest about her identity and it's part of her life that she wants the kids to know, it's her right. The parent's concern about the kids' perceptions of their marriage might be more about their own insecurities or the past issues. The ex's decision to come out isn't inherently harmful if done appropriately with the kids' maturity in mind.\n\nSo, the parent might not be in the wrong for being upset about lack of communication, but the ex isn't necessarily wrong for sharing her identity. However, the parent's main issue is the lack of consultation. If the parent feels they should have been involved, maybe they have a point in terms of co-parenting communication. But if the ex's actions are within her rights as a parent, then the parent might be overstepping by judging the ex's personal life decisions.\n\nIn summary, the parent's reaction is about communication, not the ex's sexuality itself. Since co-parenting requires collaboration, the parent is not wrong for wanting to discuss it. However, the ex's decision to come out is her right. Therefore, maybe both have some fault, but the parent is not in the wrong for being upset about the lack of consultation.\n\nAnswer: B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
