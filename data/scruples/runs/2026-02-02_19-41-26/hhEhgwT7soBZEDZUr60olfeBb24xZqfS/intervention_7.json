Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their ex split 10 years ago, had a rocky divorce. The ex has a new girlfriend and decided to tell the kids she's gay, bringing the girlfriend around. The author feels blindsided and upset because the ex didn't talk to them about it first. They also mention that the ex chose to say \"gay\" instead of \"bisexual,\" which might be affecting how the kids perceive the author's past marriage.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. Let me break it down.\n\n1. **Parental Rights and Decisions**: In a divorce, both parents typically have the right to make decisions about their children. However, major life decisions usually require mutual agreement. The ex didn't consult the author, which could be an issue. But is informing the kids about one's sexuality a major decision? It might depend on the kids' ages and the context.\n\n2. **Coming Out to Children**: The ex is openly identifying her sexuality. The author is upset that this was done without discussion. However, parents have the right to their own identity. The ex might feel that her children have a right to know about her personal life, especially if she's now in a relationship. But if the kids are minors, the other parent usually has a right to be informed since they co-parent.\n\n3. **Communication Issues**: The author tried to discuss it via text, but the ex shut them down, talking only about scheduling. The author's demand for an explanation might have been abrupt. However, the ex's response was dismissive. Lack of communication from the ex could be problematic.\n\n4. **Impact on Kids**: The author is worried about how the kids interpret this. If the ex mentioned she's gay instead of bisexual, the kids might question their dad's sexuality or the past relationship. But it's the ex's choice how she identifies, even if it leads to the kids having questions.\n\n5. **Ethics of Co-Parenting**: Co-parents are expected to discuss important matters. The ex's decision to not consult the author could be seen as a breach of co-parenting etiquette, but the author's approach via text might not be the best method for such a sensitive topic. However, the ex's refusal to engage further is also an issue.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The ex not consulting the author is a problem in co-parenting. However, the author's approach in confronting her might have been confrontational. The ex's right to live her life and identify as she chooses is a factor. The kids' well-being is key, so both parents should have discussed this. The ex's actions could be seen as self-centered, but the author's reaction could also be overly controlling. \n\nBut the key point is that the ex didn't involve the co-parent in a decision that affects shared parenting. Even if the ex is within her rights to be open about her sexuality, the co-parenting aspect requires communication. Therefore, the ex is in the wrong for not discussing it. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to know and discussing it, but their method might be questioned. However, the main issue is the ex's unilateral decision.\n"
