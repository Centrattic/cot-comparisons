Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids.

She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong after their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them. The author is upset because the ex didn't talk to them first and now brings her girlfriend around the kids.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex and the author split ten years ago. The ex hasn't dated much since, while the author has had two long-term relationships. The ex \"came out\" to the kids as gay, not bisexual, and didn't inform the author. The author is worried about what the kids think of him and their marriage. They confronted the ex, but she didn't respond beyond scheduling issues.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of co-parenting, communication is key. The ex didn't consult the author before telling the kids about her sexuality. Even though the ex is their parent, co-parents usually need to coordinate major decisions that affect the children. The author's concern is valid because the children might be confused about their parent's identity and the author's role. However, the ex's decision to come out is her personal right. But in a co-parenting context, it's important to be transparent with the other parent about such matters that impact the children.\n\nThe ex's response (not engaging beyond scheduling) is dismissive, which isn't helpful. However, the author's approach via text might not be the best way to handle it. Confronting someone about such a personal topic through text can be ineffective, especially if the other parent is not cooperating. But the author isn't wrong to express concern about their children's well-being.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they didn't previously know their ex's sexuality, then the ex's disclosure is a new development. The author isn't responsible for the ex's identity, but the ex should have considered the impact on the co-parenting relationship. The author's reaction is about the sudden change and lack of communication. Since the ex didn't coordinate with them, the author isn't at fault. The ex is in the wrong for not discussing this with the other parent first. However, the author's method of confrontation might not be optimal, but that doesn't make them wrong. The main issue is the ex's unilateral decision. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
