Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the ex-spouse told their kids she's gay, brought her girlfriend around them, and didn't consult the author. The author is upset because the divorce was already messy, and they're worried about the kids' perceptions and the sudden change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In most places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing unless there's a court order stating otherwise. Since the ex is a parent, she might have the right to discuss her sexuality with the kids, especially if she's the one spending time with them. However, it's possible that co-parents should communicate about major changes to avoid confusion for the children. But the ex didn't consult the author, which is a point of contention.\n\nNext, the author's argument is that the ex didn't ask his opinion and that the kids might be confused about their parents' previous relationship. The author feels blindsided and is upset about the sudden revelation. The ex's response was dismissive, which adds to the frustration. However, the ex might believe she has the right to live her life and share her identity with the children, especially if the author had past relationships. \n\nIt's important to note that the author's initial statement admits they \"fucked up\" in the divorce, which might imply they were the one at fault in the breakup. The ex's choice to identify as gay instead of bisexual could be her own personal decision, which the author is upset about, possibly projecting their own insecurities or guilt onto the situation. \n\nFrom a child's perspective, understanding a parent's identity is important for their well-being. The ex might feel that being honest with the kids is necessary, even if it wasn't discussed with the other parent first. The author's reaction could be seen as prioritizing their own feelings over the children's need to know their parent's identity. \n\nHowever, co-parenting etiquette suggests that both parties should communicate about significant changes that affect the children. The ex's lack of communication could be a mistake, but the author's blame on the ex for \"dropping a bomb\" might not consider the ex's need for autonomy. \n\nIn conclusion, while the ex's lack of communication is a problem, the author's expectation that the ex needed their approval might not be valid. The author's past actions in the divorce might have contributed to the strained relationship, affecting how they handle current issues. The focus should be on the children's best interests, but the author is more concerned about their own perspective being altered. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but the ex's approach could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there are nuances. However, the key point is that the ex made a decision without consulting, but the author's reaction is partly due to their own guilt from the divorce. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
