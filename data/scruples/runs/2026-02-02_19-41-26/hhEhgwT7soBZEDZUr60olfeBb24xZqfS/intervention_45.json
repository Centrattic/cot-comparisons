Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the ex-spouse told their kids she's gay and started bringing her girlfriend around, without consulting the author. The author is upset about this and feels it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids. He also mentions that the divorce was nasty and they don't get along well, but they try for the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of each parent. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing unless there's a court order restricting that. However, when there's a shared custody arrangement, it's usually expected that both parents communicate and make major decisions together. But does a parent's sexual orientation fall into that category? \n\nThe ex coming out as gay to the kids might be a personal decision, but since the kids are involved, the author might have a valid concern about how this affects the children. However, the parent's identity and relationships are part of their own life, and it's generally considered a right to live authentically. That said, the way it was handled could be problematic. The ex didn't consult the other parent, which might have been a mistake, especially given the history of a contentious divorce.\n\nThe author's reaction is to confront via text and then demand an explanation. The ex didn't respond, which complicates things. The author is worried about what the kids might think, implying that the ex's statement might have led the kids to think the author is not gay, which could confuse them. But is it the author's place to dictate the other parent's personal decisions, especially if they're not directly affecting the kids' well-being?\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be overstepping by expecting the ex to consult him about her personal life. Unless there's a specific agreement or court order requiring joint decisions on such matters, the ex might have the right to come out to the children on her own terms. However, the abruptness and lack of communication could be seen as dismissive or inconsiderate towards the other parent's concerns.\n\nIt's also possible that the author's main issue is the lack of communication rather than the ex being gay. The ex's response about not texting during parenting time suggests she's not interested in discussing it further, which could indicate a breakdown in co-parenting communication. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if the ex had the right to make that decision independently, then the author might be overreacting. But if the ex should have considered the author's input given the shared custody, then the author might have a point. However, the ex might not owe the author that consultation if it's within her rights as a parent. \n\nThe key here might be balancing the rights of the ex to live her life with the need for co-parenting cooperation. Since the author is upset about the lack of communication and the potential impact on the kids, but the ex chose not to engage further, it's a bit of a grey area. \n\nBut the author is asking if he's in the wrong. If the ex's actions are within her rights as a parent, then the author might be in the wrong for expecting her to consult him. However, the ex's decision to not communicate at all could be problematic. The author's actions\u2014texting and calling for an explanation\u2014might be justified in seeking clarification for the children's sake. \n\nOverall, the ex might be wrong for not communicating and dropping the news without discussion, but the author's insistence on being consulted could also be seen as overstepping. However, given the context, the ex's actions might be more in the wrong because of the lack of communication and consideration for the other parent's perspective. But if the author is arguing that he has a right to be consulted on such matters, maybe he's not entirely wrong. This is quite tricky. I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the ex didn't communicate, but it's a close call.\n"
