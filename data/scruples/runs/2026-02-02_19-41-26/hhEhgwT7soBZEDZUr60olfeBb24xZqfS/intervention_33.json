Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong when their ex-partner told the kids she's gay without consulting them. The author is upset that the ex didn't ask them first and is worried about the kids' understanding of their past marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of co-parenting. When parents are separated, decisions about the children's lives, especially sensitive ones, should ideally be discussed between both parents. The ex didn't consult the author, which is a red flag. Co-parenting requires communication and mutual respect, so not discussing such a significant personal decision could be seen as wrong.\n\nHowever, the author also mentions that the ex is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids. The author might feel blindsided, but the ex's right to her own identity and her relationship with her current partner is important. The key issue here is whether the ex had a responsibility to inform the author about her sexual orientation in the context of the children's lives.\n\nThe author's argument is that discussing sexuality with children isn't acceptable. However, the ex's decision to come out to the kids could be for the children's benefit, to explain her new relationship. The author might be projecting their own feelings about their past marriage onto the situation, but the ex's identity is her own, and she has the right to live authentically.\n\nThat said, the ex could have done a better job of communication. Even if it's her right to come out, not discussing it with the co-parent is a co-parenting failure. Both parents should collaborate on matters affecting the children. The author's frustration is valid in that sense.\n\nBut the author is also taking offense to the ex being gay, implying that it reflects on their past marriage. This could be a personal insecurity or misunderstanding. The author might be struggling with how to explain their own marriage history to the children, but that's their issue, not the ex's.\n\nIn co-parenting scenarios, the priority is the children's well-being. The ex's decision to be open about her sexuality might be important for the kids to understand her as a parent now. However, the lack of communication from the ex is a mistake. The author's confrontation via text might not have been the best approach either, but it's their right to express concerns.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's main point is about the ex not consulting them. The ex's actions breached co-parenting communication, so the ex is at fault for that. The author isn't wrong for being upset about not being consulted. However, the author's judgment about the ex being gay and the implications for the marriage might be problematic. The author might be struggling with their own feelings about the divorce and their identity, but that's separate from the ex's right to come out.\n\nOverall, the ex's failure to communicate is the main issue, but the author is not entirely in the right either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is reacting to a breach in co-parenting communication and isn't directly violating any norms in their response (other than maybe the tone), the fault might lie more with the ex. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
