Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex-spouse came out as gay to their kids without discussing it with the author first. The author feels blindsided and is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The divorce was ten years ago and was contentious. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term relationships. The ex introduced her girlfriend to the kids without consulting the author, and when confronted, the ex was dismissive.\n\nThe key points here are the communication between the parents and the well-being of the children. In co-parenting situations, especially after a difficult divorce, communication is crucial. The ex didn't reach out to the author beforehand, which might be a problem. However, a parent's decision to come out as LGBTQ+ is a personal matter. The author might be projecting their own feelings about the situation onto the children, worrying about what the kids think of him and their past marriage.\n\nBut, the main issue is whether the ex was wrong to not consult the author. While co-parents should ideally discuss major changes, the ex's decision to come out is a personal aspect of her identity. It's possible that the ex felt it was important for the kids to know, especially if she's now in a relationship. However, the author's reaction might stem from his own insecurities or past issues, given the history of a nasty divorce.\n\nAnother angle: the author is focusing on how the kids perceive him rather than supporting his ex. The kids might need reassurance that their parent's identity is valid and that they are loved. The author's main concern seems to be about his image rather than the kids' feelings.\n\nThe ex's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong for coming out to the kids. The author's demand for an explanation and lack of consideration for his ex's autonomy might be the issue here.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his ex's identity and is prioritizing his own feelings over the co-parent's right to live authentically. However, the ex's lack of communication is also a problem. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer would depend on whether the author's reaction is valid. If the author is overstepping by not letting his ex discuss her sexuality with the kids, then he's in the wrong. But if the ex should have communicated, maybe not. But typically, coming out to children is a personal decision, and the author's reaction might be more about his own issues.\n"
