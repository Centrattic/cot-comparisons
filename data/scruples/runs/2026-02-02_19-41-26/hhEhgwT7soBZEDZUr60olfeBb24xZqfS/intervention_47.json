Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex-spouse coming out as gay to the kids without discussing it with the other parent first. The author is upset because the ex didn't consult them and is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The ex told the kids she's gay without the author's input. The author feels blindsided and is worried about the kids' perceptions. They had a difficult divorce, so communication might already be strained. The ex isn't answering texts, which adds to the frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex has the right to her own identity and decisions about her family. Parents should have some autonomy in their personal lives, especially if they're the custodial parent. However, involving children in such a personal matter without considering the other parent's feelings could be problematic, especially if the kids are young. But the ex did mention the girlfriend, which might mean she's in a relationship and wants to integrate that into her parenting.\n\nThe author's main issue isn't about the ex's sexuality but the lack of communication and the impact on the kids. But is it the author's place to object? Since the ex is a parent, she has the right to present her life to the children, as long as it's age-appropriate. The author might be overstepping by demanding explanations, especially if the kids are old enough to understand. However, the ex's approach could have been more considerate by discussing it with the other parent first.\n\nBut wait, the author is the one who initiated the confrontation via text, demanding an explanation. The ex is responding by not engaging in non-scheduling texts. The author might be the one causing conflict here instead of allowing the ex to handle her parenting decisions. However, the author's concern about the kids' well-being is valid. If the kids are confused or if the ex's actions are causing them distress, the author has a right to be concerned.\n\nBut the key point is that the ex is the parent, and she has the right to her own life. Unless the author can show that this is harmful to the kids, it's about the ex's personal life. The author's past actions (admitting to messing up the marriage) might have contributed to the current strained relationship, but that's not directly relevant here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the ex made a decision as a parent to introduce her sexuality to the kids, which might be necessary for her own well-being and the kids' understanding. The author's reaction is about control over a situation that's primarily the ex's domain. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the ex's autonomy as a parent, even if the approach could have been better. So answer A.\n"
