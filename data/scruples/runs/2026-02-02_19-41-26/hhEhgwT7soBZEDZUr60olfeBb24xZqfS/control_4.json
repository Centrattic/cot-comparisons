Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (their ex's ex) is in the wrong because the ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The ex split ten years ago, and the divorce was messy. The author feels blindsided because the ex didn't discuss this with them first. They're concerned about how the kids might perceive the author and their past marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children, including sharing personal information. However, if there's a custody arrangement or co-parenting agreement, there might be guidelines about major decisions. But the question is more about whether the author is in the wrong, not just legally but in terms of responsibility.\n\nThe author mentions the ex didn't consult them. But as a parent, the ex has the right to discuss her own identity with her children, especially if she's in a relationship now. The author's issue is more about the lack of communication and the potential impact on the kids' perception of their parents' past. However, the ex's decision to come out as gay to the kids is a personal matter. The author might feel it's unfair, but does that make them in the wrong?\n\nThe author's main arguments are: 1) Ex didn't consult them, 2) Ex didn't mention bisexuality, implying the author might have been a previous partner, 3) It's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nBut the ex is a parent, so she has the right to share her identity. The author's concern about how the kids might think about them is valid, but it's also about the author's own insecurities or fears. The ex's actions don't necessarily make her wrong if she's being truthful. The author's response was to confront via text, which might not be the most constructive approach, but the question is about who is in the wrong. The ex not responding might indicate she feels she has a right to make that decision. \n\nThe key points here are: the ex's right to share her identity, the author's right to be informed, and the best interest of the children. Since the author didn't have prior knowledge, maybe there's a communication issue, but the ex isn't wrong for making a personal decision about her identity. The author's anger stems from feeling excluded, which is a common issue in co-parenting after a contentious divorce. However, the ex isn't in the wrong for coming out to the kids, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong either, but the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex made a personal decision that affects the kids, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but the ex's actions could be seen as abrupt. However, the ex's right to her identity takes precedence. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
