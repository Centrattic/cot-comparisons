Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the ex-partner told the kids she's gay without consulting the author, and now he's upset about it. They have three kids, the divorce was messy, and they don't get along well but try to co-parent.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if he's at fault. He mentions that his ex didn't warn him and chose to label herself as gay, which makes him worry about what the kids think about him and their marriage. He also thinks it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. He confronted her, but she didn't respond beyond scheduling.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The ex and the author split ten years ago, and he admits he messed up, leading to a long, nasty divorce. They have joint custody, so both have parenting time. The key issue is the ex's decision to come out as gay to the kids without consulting the author. \n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to discuss their sexuality with their children, especially if it affects the kids' understanding of their family dynamics. However, the way it was done matters. If the ex didn't consider the author's feelings or potential impact on the kids, that could be a problem. But the kids are part of both parents' lives, so maybe the ex thought it was necessary to be open with them about her identity regardless of the ex-husband's opinion.\n\nThe author is upset because he wasn't consulted. But in co-parenting situations, especially after a contentious divorce, communication is crucial. However, the ex might have believed that her sexual orientation is her personal business to disclose, and that the kids have a right to know their parent's identity. \n\nThe author's argument is that discussing sexuality with children isn't acceptable. But in reality, if the child is old enough to understand such a concept, a parent might need to be honest about their identity to model authenticity and provide a truthful family narrative. The author might be projecting his own discomfort or fear of judgment onto the children.\n\nBut the ex didn't consult him. Maybe she should have discussed it with him first, considering the co-parenting arrangement. However, since the kids are part of both parents' lives, the ex has a right to her own identity and how she presents it to them. It's possible that the author is overstepping by expecting to have control over how the ex discusses her personal matters with the kids.\n\nOn the other hand, bringing a girlfriend around the kids without prior communication could be problematic if the kids are not prepared for it. The ex's refusal to discuss it further is unhelpful. The author's approach via text might not be the best way to handle it, but the core issue is whether the ex was wrong to disclose her sexuality without consulting him.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The ex has the right to her identity, but the method of disclosure without considering the co-parent's input might be where the problem lies. However, the author's reaction is also valid if he feels blindsided, but he might have had a responsibility to communicate better, especially if the kids' well-being is the priority. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong if the ex unilaterally made a decision that could affect the family dynamic without consulting him. But if the ex's disclosure is about her personal life that doesn't directly interfere with the kids' lives, it's her right. However, since the kids are involved, communication between co-parents is essential. So, the ex might be in the wrong for not discussing it first, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
