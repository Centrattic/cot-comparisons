Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them. The author is upset because they think it's not appropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the ex and author split a decade ago, and their relationship was acrimonious. They have three kids, and they're trying to co-parent despite not getting along. The ex came out to the kids as gay, bringing her girlfriend around them without telling the author. The author feels blindsided and is worried about what the kids might think of their past marriage.\n\nThe author is arguing that the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids without consulting him. They think it's not acceptable for a parent to do that. The ex didn't respond to his texts, just said not to contact her during parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\n\nNow, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, both parents usually have rights to make decisions about their children's lives unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. However, co-parenting requires cooperation. The ex might believe that her sexuality is her personal choice, and she has the right to be open with their children. But the author feels it's not appropriate, maybe because they're concerned about the kids' understanding or the impact on their perception of the author's past marriage.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, coming out as a parent to their children could be seen as a personal matter. The ex might feel that the kids should know the truth about her identity, especially if she's in a new relationship. However, not consulting the co-parent could be seen as a breach of co-parenting communication. But if there's a history of conflict, maybe the ex didn't think to include the author, or maybe she felt it was her right.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the ex told the kids she's gay, and the author thinks that's not acceptable. But is it? If the ex is in a relationship with a woman, maybe the kids would notice her being with someone and might wonder. The ex might have thought it's better to be honest with the kids. The author is upset that the ex didn't discuss it with him first, but if they don't have joint custody or an agreement on such matters, the ex might have the right to make decisions during her parenting time.\n\nBut the author is also at fault for not maintaining a cooperative relationship. If they have joint custody, they should communicate about major decisions. If they don't, maybe the ex is acting within her rights. However, the author is concerned about the kids' well-being, which is valid. Maybe the ex handled it poorly, but the author shouldn't necessarily be in the wrong for being upset. However, if the author is a co-parent, maybe he has a right to be informed. But if the kids are old enough to understand, the ex might have a right to be open with them.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because the ex has the right to her identity and relationships, and the kids might need to know. The author's problem is more about the lack of communication, but if there's no legal requirement to consult, maybe the ex isn't wrong. However, the author's concern about the kids' perception is valid. But in terms of right or wrong, the ex is not wrong for being honest with her children about her identity. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that right. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong? Wait, the user thought the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion. But maybe the author is not in the wrong here? Hmm.\n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me check again. The author is upset that the ex came out to the kids without their input. The ex might have a right to her identity, so the author's problem is that the ex didn't consult him. But the author isn't the one making the decision here; the ex is the parent in her time. Unless there's a custody arrangement that requires joint decisions, the ex can make that choice. So the author is in the wrong for expecting the ex to consult him on her personal life, unless there's a legal requirement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A), but maybe the answer is B? Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not in the wrong, then B. If the author is in the wrong, A.\n\nI think the key point is whether the author has a right to be consulted about the ex's decision to come out to the kids. If the ex is the parent during her time, she can make those decisions. The author is upset about it, but maybe he's in the wrong for not respecting her decision. However, if the parent's decision could affect the children's well-being, like if coming out in a certain way could harm them, then the author might have a valid concern. But the author's argument is that he thinks it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids. That's a personal belief, but the ex has her own views. So the author is in the wrong for not accepting that the ex can make that choice. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong). But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is B because the author isn't wrong for being upset about lack of communication. Wait, but if the ex is the parent during her time, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about being excluded. But the ex might be in the wrong for not communicating. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. So I need to decide.\n\nI think the answer is B (author is not in the wrong) because the ex shouldn't have made that decision without discussing it with the co-parent, especially when it involves the children. But if the ex has sole custody during her time, then she can make such decisions. However, in many jurisdictions, both parents have rights, and major decisions should be discussed. If the ex didn't consult the author, maybe she's in the wrong. But the author is the one who is upset about being excluded. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong) because the ex is wrong for not consulting. But I'm confused. Let me check.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's main point is that the ex shouldn't have told the kids without discussing. The author is not wrong for being upset about that. The ex is wrong for not consulting. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). Wait, but the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. So the answer is B.\n"
