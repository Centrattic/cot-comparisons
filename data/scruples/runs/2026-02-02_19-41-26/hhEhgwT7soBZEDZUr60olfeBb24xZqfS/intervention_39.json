Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The author is upset because the ex didn't ask for their opinion and now brings her girlfriend around the kids. They think the kids might be confused about the author's past marriage and are upset that their ex discussed her sexuality with the children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and co-parenting etiquette. Ex-partners usually have some level of cooperation for the kids' sake, even if they're not close. The ex made a significant life choice (coming out) that affects the kids, which the author feels was done without their input. But is it the author's place to have a say in their ex's personal life, especially regarding the children?\n\nIn some cases, parents do discuss their identities with their kids, especially if it's part of their personal relationships. However, the key issue here is whether the author should have been consulted. The ex might believe it's her right to share her sexuality with her own children, regardless of the ex's opinions. The author's marriage ended, so the current relationship status of the ex might not directly impact the kids in a way that requires the author's approval.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel blindsided because the ex didn't consider their perspective. However, if the kids are now seeing the ex with a girlfriend, the author's past relationship with the ex doesn't inherently affect the kids' understanding of their own father's sexuality. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or past issues onto the situation.\n\nThe ex's response was dismissive, which is unhelpful, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is right. The core question is whether the ex was wrong to inform the kids. From a co-parenting standpoint, major life decisions that involve the presence of other adults (like a partner) might need to be discussed, but the ex's sexuality is her own identity. The kids need to know their parent's truth, even if it's unexpected. The author's anger might stem from feeling excluded rather than the ex's right to share her identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong, but the ex's actions aren't necessarily wrong either. However, the author's claim that discussing sexuality with children is unacceptable is debatable. Parents often discuss such topics depending on the child's age and maturity. The ex's approach might have been abrupt, but the act itself isn't inherently wrong. The author's main grievance is about being informed without consultation, but co-parenting sometimes requires mutual respect without needing consensus on every personal choice. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for expecting input on their ex's personal life that affects their shared children.\n"
