Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after their ex came out as gay to the kids without consulting them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their ex had a messy divorce ten years ago. They don't get along but co-parent three kids. The ex decided to come out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around, without talking to the author first. The author feels blindsided and upset, thinking the kids might now have negative thoughts about their previous marriage. They confronted the ex, but she didn't respond beyond scheduling issues.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe ex's actions: Coming out as a parent to children can be a significant decision. While it's her personal life, involving children in such matters without the other parent's input might be problematic. Kids might feel confused or not ready for such information. Also, the author's concern about the kids' perception of their past marriage is valid if the ex is framing her sexuality in a way that might reflect on the author's past.\n\nThe author's response: They texted the ex, demanding an explanation, but the ex didn't respond. The author is upset about being excluded. However, the author's initial admission of fault in the divorce (\"I fucked up\") might make readers question their current stance. Maybe the author's reaction is more about control than the kids' well-being.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing. However, if the ex is making decisions about her personal life that affect the children, it's a gray area. The key is whether the kids are being harmed. If the ex is being open and honest about her sexuality, and the kids are mature enough, it's a parent's right. But the ex didn't consult the other parent, which could be an issue if it affects the kids' well-being.\n\nPossible biases: The author's harsh language (\"I fucked up\", \"nasty divorce\") might make readers question their credibility. They might be projecting their own insecurities onto the situation. Also, the author's focus on the kids' thoughts about their marriage could be more about their own ego than the kids' needs.\n\nIn conclusion, the ex might have a right to her personal life, but involving the children without the other parent's input could be problematic. However, the author's reaction might be more about their own feelings than the kids' best interests. The answer hinges on whether the ex's disclosure was appropriate and if the author's response was reasonable. Since the author admitted fault in the divorce, their current stance might be seen as less valid. The ex's refusal to communicate could indicate she feels her right to make such decisions isn't subject to the author's approval. So, the author might not be in the wrong if the ex overstepped, but the ex's actions could also be justified if she believes it's in the kids' best interest. It's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points, but I lean towards the author being in the right here because the ex made a unilateral decision that affects co-parenting without consultation, which is generally expected in co-parenting arrangements.\n"
