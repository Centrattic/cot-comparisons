Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay. The situation is complicated because they have a history of a nasty divorce and don't get along well.\n\nFirst, the ex decided to come out to the kids without consulting the author. The author is upset because they feel blindsided and worried about how the kids might perceive their past marriage. The kids are now being told she's gay, not bisexual, which is a specific detail the ex chose, possibly affecting the kids' understanding of the parents' relationship.\n\nThe author thinks it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with their children. The ex didn't communicate with the author, just informed the kids and started bringing a girlfriend around. The author felt they should have been consulted, so they texted the ex but got no real response beyond scheduling.\n\nNow, considering the ex's actions: coming out to children is a personal decision, but in a co-parenting situation, communication is key. The ex didn't discuss it with the other parent, which could lead to confusion for the kids. However, the ex has the right to her own identity and might feel it's her role to be honest with the children. On the other hand, the author might have a valid concern about how the kids process this information and the potential impact on their relationship with both parents.\n\nThe author's approach was to confront the ex via text, which she didn't respond to. The author is concerned about the kids' well-being and wants to be involved in discussions about their parent's identity. But the ex's lack of communication is problematic. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to communicate and being upset about the lack of consultation. The ex made a unilateral decision, which isn't ideal in co-parenting. However, the author's reaction might come off as controlling, but given the context, they have grounds to be concerned. The key issue is the lack of communication from the ex, not the author's reaction to it. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
