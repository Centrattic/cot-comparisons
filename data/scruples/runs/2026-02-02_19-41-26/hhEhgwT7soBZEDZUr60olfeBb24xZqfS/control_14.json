Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The situation involves the ex telling their kids she's gay without consulting the author.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The ex and the author are divorced, had a bad split, but trying for the kids. The ex didn't date much, while the author had two long-term girlfriends. The ex came out to the kids as gay and started bringing her girlfriend around, without discussing it with the author. The author feels blindsided and is upset about how the kids might perceive him and their marriage. He confronted her, but she didn't respond, just mentioned not to text during parenting time unless it's scheduling.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication between co-parents, the appropriateness of discussing sexuality with children, and the responsibility of parental decisions affecting the other parent.\n\nIn co-parenting situations, especially after a contentious divorce, communication is crucial. Even if the relationship is strained, major decisions affecting the kids, like introducing a new partner or discussing personal identity, should ideally be discussed with the other parent. The ex didn't consult the author, which could be seen as a failure to prioritize co-parenting. However, the author is also upset about the kids' perception of him and the marriage, implying he might have hidden his own sexuality as well. Wait, the author says he had two long-term girlfriends. So maybe he's not gay, but the ex coming out as gay might lead the kids to think the author is straight, which he might not want them to assume. But the author's issue is more about the ex not involving him and making a big decision without his input.\n\nThe ex's action of telling the kids she's gay without discussing it with the author could be problematic. While parents have the right to live their lives, introducing a new partner to children, especially in a way that involves their sexual identity, is a significant co-parenting issue. The author has a right to be informed, especially if it affects the children's understanding of both parents. The ex's non-response and dismissive attitude might indicate she's avoiding the conversation, which isn't helpful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset about how the kids might view him. If the ex didn't explain the situation properly, the kids might misinterpret the author's past relationships. However, the author's responsibility is to communicate with the ex to clarify things with the kids, not to expect the ex to keep his identity a secret. But since the author is the one who had girlfriends, maybe the ex's coming out as gay isn't directly his issue unless there's a fear of misinformation.\n\nThe main issue here is the lack of communication from the ex. She made a significant life decision that affects the children and the co-parenting dynamic without consulting the other parent. That's generally considered inconsiderate. The author, while upset, is trying to address the issue, which shows he's attempting to fulfill his co-parenting role. The ex's refusal to engage in the conversation complicates matters further.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's trying to communicate and is concerned about how the kids perceive things. The ex's actions are the problem\u2014she didn't discuss this with him first. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
