Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong when their ex told the kids she's gay. The author is upset because the ex didn't consult them and now brings a girlfriend around the kids. They also think it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex and author are co-parents, even though their divorce was bad. The ex is now in a relationship and chose to come out as gay to the kids. The author is upset because they weren't consulted and they think the kids might have negative feelings towards them now. The ex didn't explain her sexuality as bisexual, which might be causing confusion. The author confronted the ex, but she didn't respond beyond scheduling issues.\n\nNow, from a co-parenting perspective, communication is key. The ex didn't discuss this with the author, which is a problem. However, an adult's sexuality is a personal matter, and sharing it with children might be necessary if the children are asking or if it's relevant. The author's reaction might be based on feeling blindsided, but the ex's right to live her life and be open about her identity is also important.\n\nThe author mentions the ex is bringing her girlfriend around the kids. It's possible that the kids are old enough to understand, and the ex is being honest with them. The author's anger might stem from feeling that their ex is making a judgment about their past marriage. However, the ex's sexuality doesn't necessarily reflect on the author's past marriage unless the author was hiding something.\n\nIn terms of the kids' well-being, it's important that they know both parents are okay with their respective partners. The author's refusal to engage in the discussion beyond scheduling might be a bigger issue. The ex might have a right to her privacy and her relationship, and the author's demand for an explanation could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the ex's personal life and for not engaging constructively. The ex's actions, while perhaps done without prior discussion, are about her own identity, which is significant. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
