Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them. The author is a former spouse who had a messy divorce and doesn't get along well with their ex, but they're both trying for the kids' sake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, including matters related to personal identity. However, if there's a custody agreement, there might be specific terms about how decisions are made. The author mentions that the ex didn't consult them, which could be an issue if there's an agreement in place that requires mutual consent.\n\nNext, the author is upset that the ex labeled herself as gay rather than bisexual, which is causing the kids to think something about the author's past. But the ex's own identity isn't the author's to control. The ex's decision to come out to the kids is her right, unless there's a legal restriction. The author might feel blindsided, but the ex's actions could be about her own need to be authentic, especially if she's been in a long-term relationship.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the ex via text, but the ex didn't respond. The ex's reply about not texting during parenting time unless it's about scheduling suggests she's following a boundary. The author's demand for an explanation might be seen as overstepping, especially if the ex is within her rights to make such decisions about her own identity and relationships.\n\nAlso, the author's initial statement about not thinking it's acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children might be problematic. Children need honest information about their parents, and withholding such information could be harmful. The key here is whether the ex provided age-appropriate explanations and ensured the kids understand that her identity doesn't reflect on the author.\n\nIn terms of fault, the ex might not be in the wrong because she has the right to live her life authentically and share her identity with her children. The author's upset could stem from feeling the ex is making a choice that affects him, but unless there's a legal agreement preventing it, the ex isn't obligated to consult the author. The author's reaction might be about personal hurt rather than the kids' best interests.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong if there's a legal requirement for shared decision-making, but likely the ex is within her rights. The author's issue is more about personal feelings and the ex's choice to act independently. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) if there's a custody arrangement requiring consultation, but if not, maybe the author is in the wrong. Wait, the user thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to check again.\n\nWait, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But according to the analysis, if the ex is within her rights to make that decision without the author's input, then the author isn't in the wrong. Wait, no\u2014if the ex is acting on her own right to come out, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but maybe the ex is in the wrong for not consulting if required. However, if there's no such requirement, the author isn't wrong for being upset, but the ex's actions are justified. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would be B (author not in the wrong) if the ex overstepped, but if the ex had the right, then the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit complicated. But given that the author is a co-parent and the ex made a decision without consulting, but the ex's right to identity is a factor. Maybe the author is not in the wrong if the ex should have discussed it. But I'm not sure. Hmm.\n"
