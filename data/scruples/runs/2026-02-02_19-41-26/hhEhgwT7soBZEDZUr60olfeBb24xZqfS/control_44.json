Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong after their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them.\n\nFirst, the divorce was ten years ago and was nasty. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex decided to come out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around. The author feels blindsided and is upset that it was done without discussion. They texted the ex, but she only responded about scheduling and ignored further questions.\n\nNow, the key points: Is it wrong for a parent to discuss their sexuality with their children? The author says they don't think it's acceptable. But in reality, parents often talk to their kids about their personal lives, especially if they're in a new relationship. However, the author's ex is the parent here, so maybe the author's input matters because they co-parent.\n\nBut wait, the ex is the parent, so she might have a right to be open with the kids. However, since it's a co-parenting situation, the author might feel it's important to be informed. But does the author have a right to be consulted? That's debatable. The ex might feel that as a parent, she can make decisions about her own family life without needing approval from the ex.\n\nThe author is upset that the ex chose to identify as gay rather than bisexual, which might imply he's hiding something. But the ex's identity is her own, and the author shouldn't dictate that. However, the kids are involved, so the way this was handled could affect them. The author might be concerned about how the kids are perceiving the past marriage, but the ex's current identity doesn't necessarily reflect on the author.\n\nThe ex's response was dismissive, not engaging in the conversation. That's poor communication. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't wrong for being upset, but maybe the ex is at fault for not discussing it. However, the author might not have a right to be consulted about the ex's personal identity. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's some nuance here. The ex might be wrong for not discussing, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. So B makes sense.\n"
