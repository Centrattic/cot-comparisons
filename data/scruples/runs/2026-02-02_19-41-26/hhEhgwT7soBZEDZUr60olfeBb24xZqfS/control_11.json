Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is at fault for questioning their ex's decision to tell their kids she's gay. The ex didn't consult them and now they're upset about the kids possibly thinking they're in a same-sex marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex is a parent, so their role in their children's lives is significant. When it comes to a parent's sexual orientation, especially if they're in a new relationship, there's a common expectation that both parents might have a say, especially if they're co-parenting. But the key here is that the ex came out to the kids without consulting the other parent. That part is important because co-parenting often requires communication and mutual agreement on major decisions affecting the children.\n\nThe user is upset because their ex didn't discuss this with them. They feel blindsided, which is understandable. The ex's response was dismissive, only talking about scheduling during parenting time, which might indicate a lack of willingness to address the issue. The user is also worried about the kids' perception of their previous marriage, which adds to their distress.\n\nNow, in terms of right and wrong, the main issue is whether the ex had the right to share her sexuality with the kids without consulting the other parent. In many cases, parents do make such decisions independently, especially if it's about their own identity. However, when co-parenting, especially after a contentious divorce, transparency is usually recommended. The ex might believe it's her right to live her authentic life, which is valid, but the lack of communication could be the problem here. \n\nThe user's reaction is also important. Confronting via text and demanding an explanation is part of their process, but the ex's refusal to engage further complicates things. However, the user isn't being accused of any wrongdoing in the situation; the question is about the ex's actions. \n\nLegally, in many places, each parent has the right to make decisions regarding their own lifestyle, but when it affects the children, especially in a co-parenting scenario, communication is key. The ex's decision to not consult could be seen as a breach of co-parenting norms, even if it's not a legal violation. The user's concern about the kids' understanding of their parents' previous relationship is also a valid emotional impact.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the ex might be at fault for not discussing the matter with the other parent, especially considering the potential impact on the children. The user isn't in the wrong for being upset and seeking communication. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
