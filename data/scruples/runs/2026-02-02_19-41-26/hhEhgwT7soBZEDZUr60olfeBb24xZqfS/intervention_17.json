Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the question) is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and ex split ten years ago, a bad divorce. They have three kids and don't get along but try for the kids. The ex started bringing a girlfriend around the kids and told them she's gay without consulting the author. The author is upset because he's worried about the kids' perception of him and their marriage. He's also upset that he wasn't informed and that his ex didn't seek his input. He sent a text, but she didn't respond beyond scheduling.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author's main arguments:\n1. He feels his ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids without consulting him. He's concerned about the kids' understanding of their parents' situation.\n2. He's upset because she didn't ask for his opinion or explain her actions. He believes she should have communicated this with him first.\n\nThe ex's actions: Coming out to the kids and bringing her girlfriend around them. The parent's responsibility here is to consider the children's well-being. But in a divorced situation where both parents have equal rights (assuming joint custody), each parent has the right to raise their children as they see fit, within reason.\n\nHowever, when it comes to significant family changes, communication is important. But does the author have a right to approve or object to his ex's personal life, especially if it relates to her sexuality? The ex's sexuality is her personal matter, but introducing a new partner might affect the children's dynamics.\n\nBut here, the ex is not hiding her sexuality; she's being open with the kids. The author might feel blindsided, but the ex is within her rights as a parent to discuss her identity with her children. The issue is whether the author has a right to expect prior consultation. \n\nIn co-parenting, it's generally advisable to communicate about major changes that affect the children. However, the ex's sexual orientation is a personal aspect that might not require the other parent's approval. The ex's decision to come out to the kids is a personal choice, and the author's reaction might stem from insecurity about his ex's motives or the kids' perception of him.\n\nThe author's concern about the kids thinking he's responsible for the divorce or that he did something to cause it is a valid emotional response, but it's not the ex's responsibility to consider the author's feelings in this context. The kids need to know their parent's truth, and the ex has the right to express her identity.\n\nHowever, the author's approach to confrontation via text might not have been the best. He should have considered discussing this in person, but the ex's lack of response is also problematic. She could have been more communicative about her intentions.\n\nBut the central question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the ex is being truthful and open with her children about her identity, even if it's a surprise, that's her decision as a parent. The author's right to know might be secondary to the kids' right to know their parent. Unless the ex is hiding something harmful, her actions aren't necessarily wrong. The author's upset is more about his own feelings rather than the kids' well-being. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, the ex's actions don't seem inherently wrong, so maybe the author is not in the wrong. Wait, but the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
