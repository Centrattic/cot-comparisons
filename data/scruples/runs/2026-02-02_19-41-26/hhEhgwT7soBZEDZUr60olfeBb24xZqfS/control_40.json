Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong when their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The ex and the author split ten years ago due to a nasty divorce. Now, they co-parent three kids. The ex didn't date much after the split, but the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The key point is that the ex came out to the kids as gay and is bringing her girlfriend around them without discussing it with the author. The author is upset about not being consulted and is concerned about how the kids perceive the author's past marriage.\n\nThe author sent a text to the ex, who responded by saying not to text during parenting time unless it's about scheduling. The author then demanded an explanation but got no response. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, unless a court has specified otherwise. However, if the ex is the custodial parent, they might have more decision-making power. But since they split ten years ago, it's possible they have a co-parenting agreement. The author is upset because their ex made a significant life decision without consulting them, which could affect the children's understanding of their family dynamics.\n\nAlso, coming out to children is a sensitive matter. While the ex has the right to her own identity, how she chooses to share that with the kids is important. The author is worried about the kids' perception of their previous marriage and the author's identity. The ex's refusal to communicate further complicates the situation.\n\nLegally, unless there's a specific agreement stating that both parents must be consulted on personal matters, one parent might have the right to make such decisions. However, co-parenting typically requires cooperation and communication. The ex's refusal to engage in the conversation could be problematic. The author is within their rights to be upset about not being informed, especially if the children are now being told information that might influence their view of their parent's past.\n\nBut, the ex's decision to come out to the kids is her personal right. However, if the children are minors, the timing and manner of such a disclosure should consider the children's well-being and the co-parent's perspective. The author's reaction is about being excluded from a significant decision affecting the family. However, the author's own past (being married to the ex, having a different sexual orientation) might mean that the kids now have a different understanding of their parents' history. \n\nThe ex's response is dismissive, which isn't helpful. The author isn't wrong for being upset, but whether they are in the wrong depends on the context. If the ex has sole custody, she might have more authority. But if they are co-parents, collaboration is expected. The author isn't in the wrong for demanding to know why they weren't consulted, especially if it's part of their co-parenting agreement to communicate on such matters. The ex's refusal to respond further is problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and seeking communication. The ex's actions might be her right, but the lack of consultation is the issue. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
