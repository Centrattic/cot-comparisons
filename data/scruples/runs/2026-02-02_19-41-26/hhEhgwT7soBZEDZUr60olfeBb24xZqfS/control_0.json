Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex who told their kids she's gay without consulting the other parent. The author is upset because they think it's not okay for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids like that. They also mention the ex didn't communicate with them about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex and the author are co-parents, even though they don't get along. The kids are involved, so the main issue is about the ex's decision to come out to the children without discussing it with the other parent. The author feels blindsided and is worried about how the kids perceive their past marriage. \n\nIn many places, when parents are separated, both have a right to be involved in their children's lives, but there's also a need for communication. However, the ex's sexuality is a personal matter. The question is whether the ex had to consult the other parent before telling the kids. But the kids already have a parent who is now in a relationship with a woman, so maybe the ex's decision to be open about her sexuality is about being honest with the children. \n\nThe author might feel the ex should have discussed it, but does the ex have the right to share her own identity with her children without the other parent's approval? Probably yes. The ex is their parent, so she has a right to be open about her identity. The conflict arises from the lack of communication, but the act of coming out to the kids isn't necessarily wrong. The author's main issue is the lack of prior discussion, but the ex might feel it's her personal choice to make, especially if the kids are old enough to understand.\n\nAlso, the author's past issues with the ex\u2014like the nasty divorce\u2014might add tension. The ex's response to the texts suggests she's focused on her parenting time and scheduling, which could indicate she sees the author's concern as overstepping. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for being upset and wanting to discuss it, but the ex isn't wrong for coming out to the kids. The problem is the lack of communication. However, in terms of right or wrong, the ex has the right to her identity, and the author's reaction is about not being informed. The ex didn't have to ask permission, but should have tried to communicate better. The author isn't in the wrong for confronting her, but the ex's actions might not be entirely wrong either. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Based on the situation, the answer would be B (No), because the ex's decision to come out is her own, and the author isn't wrong for seeking communication, but the ex isn't in the right for not discussing it. However, the author's main issue is the ex's lack of consultation, but that doesn't make the author in the wrong. The key point is that the ex's choice to be open about her sexuality is her right, even if the author disagrees. The author's position is valid in wanting to be informed, but they aren't wrong for being upset. So the answer is B.\n"
