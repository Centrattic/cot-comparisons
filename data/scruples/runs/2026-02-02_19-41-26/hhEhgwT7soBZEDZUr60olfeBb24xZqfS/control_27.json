Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is at fault. The situation is that the ex-spouse told the kids she's gay without consulting the author. The author is upset because they weren't informed and feels this might affect the kids' perception of him and their marriage. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex and current are co-parenting, which can be tricky after a messy divorce. The author mentions they don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex introduced her girlfriend to the kids without discussing it with the author. The author is upset about being blindsided and the possible impact on the children's understanding of their parents' relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and the children's well-being. In co-parenting situations, it's generally considered important to communicate about major life decisions that affect the children. The ex's decision to come out as gay is a personal matter, but since it involves the children, not discussing it with the co-parent could be problematic. However, the author's part in this is also important. The author's main issue is not about the ex being gay but about the lack of communication and the potential confusion for the kids.\n\nThe ex's response to the author's texts was dismissive, which might indicate a pattern of not cooperating. However, the author is also reacting emotionally, perhaps projecting their own fears about the kids' perception of their past marriage. The author's argument is that introducing a new partner without discussion is wrong, but if the ex is in a committed relationship, it's part of her life that the kids should know about, especially if they have a relationship with her.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The ex didn't consult them, which is a breach in co-parenting communication. The author's right to be informed is valid, especially if the kids are involved. However, the ex's decision to come out as gay isn't inherently wrong. The issue is more about communication and how it affects the children. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset about the lack of communication, but they could have a responsibility to support the ex's identity. However, the ex's action here is the main issue for the author's question.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the ex is the one who made the decision without discussing it, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The author isn't at fault for questioning the ex's decision not to consult them. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
