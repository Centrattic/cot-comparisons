Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being upset that their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The divorce was already contentious, and they have three kids. The ex hasn't dated much, but the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex came out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around, all without informing the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have equal rights to make decisions about their children's lives. However, when it comes to personal matters like sexual orientation, it's different. The ex's sexual identity is her personal business, but how she chooses to share that with the kids might be a point of contention. \n\nThe author is upset because they feel blindsided and that the kids might have negative perceptions about their previous marriage. But is the author in the wrong for being upset? The key here is whether the ex had an obligation to consult the author before discussing her sexuality with the children. \n\nOn one hand, the ex has a right to her identity and her relationship with the kids. On the other hand, the author might feel that major life decisions affecting the kids should be discussed with the co-parent. However, the ex's sexual orientation isn't a decision she can change; it's part of her identity. She's not forcing the kids to accept her girlfriend, but introducing her into their lives might require some communication, especially if it affects the children's well-being.\n\nThe author's approach was to confront the ex via text, which might not be the most effective method. The ex's response about not texting during parenting time unless it's about scheduling could be a boundary, but the author's concern is valid in terms of co-parenting communication. However, the author's demand for an explanation and the ex not responding could indicate a breakdown in communication, which might be a result of the previous contentious divorce.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's important to note that the ex's decision to come out to the kids is her right. But the lack of communication is problematic. However, the author's anger might stem from feeling that the ex is making unilateral decisions that affect their children. The kids' well-being is a priority here. If the ex's new relationship is stable and positive, it's in the kids' best interest to know. But the author's lack of communication might be an issue too, as they could have addressed it through a co-parenting plan or counseling instead of just texting.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, but their approach might not be effective. The ex's actions, while possibly within her rights, could have been handled with more communication. However, the author's demand for an explanation and the subsequent lack of response might indicate a need for better conflict resolution strategies. Overall, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong, but both parties could improve communication.\n"
