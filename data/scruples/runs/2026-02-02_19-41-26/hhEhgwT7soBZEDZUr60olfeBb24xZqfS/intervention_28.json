Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-partner told the kids she's gay without consulting the author, and now he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex and the author split 10 years ago, and their divorce was contentious. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term relationships. The main issue is the ex coming out to their children without discussing it with the author and bringing her girlfriend around them. The author feels this is unacceptable and is upset about how the kids might perceive him and their marriage. He reached out to her, but she didn't respond.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. From the author's perspective, he didn't know about his ex's sexuality, and she chose to tell the kids without his input. He might feel blindsided, especially since their communication hasn't been great. However, the ex might feel that as a parent, she has the right to share her identity with the children, especially if it's part of her life now. The author is a parent too, so he might want to discuss this with her, but he has a right to be informed. But is it her responsibility to consult him? Maybe not, because she's their parent too. However, considering the kids' well-being, both parents should ideally be on the same page when discussing personal matters with the children. The fact that she didn't communicate with him could be seen as a problem, especially if it affects the children's understanding of their family dynamics. On the other hand, the author might be projecting his own feelings about their past marriage onto the situation. The ex's choice to identify as gay instead of bisexual is making him question his own image in the children's eyes, but that's more about his insecurities than her actions. The ex might have a right to her own identity and the right to be open with the kids. However, the lack of communication from her side is problematic. She could have reached out to him first to discuss how to approach the kids, even if they don't get along well. The author's reaction is valid because it's a significant piece of information that could impact the children's perception of their family. So, maybe both parties have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the ex didn't consult him, maybe he's not at fault. But if he's projecting his past issues onto her, that's another angle. I think the main issue is that the ex didn't communicate with him, which is her fault. The author's reaction, while perhaps driven by personal feelings, isn't entirely wrong because he has a right to be informed. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the ex didn't consult him, and he's justified in wanting to discuss it, even if his approach could be better. However, the author's tone might be confrontational, but the core issue is the ex's lack of communication.\n"
