She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-spouse came out as gay to their kids without consulting the author. The author is upset and thinks the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex and author split ten years ago, and the divorce was difficult. The kids are involved, so the main issue is about their well-being. The ex decided to come out as gay, not bisexual, which the author finds problematic. The author feels blindsided and didn't get a chance to discuss it with the ex. The ex didn't respond to the author's texts.\n\nNow, from a legal and ethical standpoint, both parents usually have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. However, since they are co-parenting, communication is important. The ex might feel that her sexuality is a personal matter, but when it involves children, especially in a co-parenting situation, discussing it with the other parent could be necessary to ensure consistency in how they present the information to the kids.\n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to be consulted? Maybe the ex believed it was her right to come out to the kids on her terms. However, not consulting the co-parent could lead to confusion for the children. The author's concern is that the kids might think negatively about the author or their past marriage. The ex's response was dismissive, not engaging in dialogue.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the ex might have a right to her identity, but the way she communicated it without considering the co-parent's perspective could be problematic. Co-parents should ideally collaborate on major decisions affecting the children. However, the author's initial statement that \"I don't think it's acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children\" is a strong stance. That might not be universally accepted; some might argue that it's part of being honest with kids if they are old enough to understand.\n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of the ex's identity. However, the lack of communication from the ex is a key issue. The author is seeking validation for being upset about not being informed. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for reacting this way. If the author believes that the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids, that's a personal opinion, but the ex's actions might not be inherently wrong. The problem is more about the communication breakdown rather than the act itself.\n\nSo, the author's position is that the ex is wrong for not consulting, but the ex might feel that her personal life is her own and that the kids need to know. The author's stance on the topic of discussing sexuality with children is a point of contention. If the author doesn't think it's acceptable, but the ex does, there's a conflict. The author might be in the wrong for not allowing the ex to make that decision (assuming the ex has equal parenting rights), unless there's a court order. But the author's concern is valid about the kids' understanding and the impact on their relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, neither is entirely right or wrong, but the main issue is the lack of communication. The author's reaction is about being kept in the dark, but the ex might have had the right to make that decision. However, the author's claim that the ex shouldn't discuss her sexuality with the kids might not hold if the children are old enough and the ex believes it's necessary. The author might be in the wrong for not allowing the ex to make that choice, but the ex is wrong for not communicating. However, the author's initial question is whether he is in the wrong. Based on the information, the answer might lean towards B (author not in the wrong) because the ex didn't communicate, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
