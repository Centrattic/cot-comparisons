Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong after their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them. The ex didn't mention bisexuality, which the author is worried about what the kids might think of their marriage. They also think it's not okay for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, after a divorce, both parents still have rights regarding their children's upbringing. However, co-parenting can be tricky, especially when there's a history of conflict. The ex didn't consult the author, which is a point against her. But the ex is within her rights to make her own decisions about her personal life, including her sexuality, especially if she's comfortable with it.\n\nThe author is upset because the ex didn't ask for their opinion. But in co-parenting situations, unless there's a legal agreement specifying certain conditions, each parent has the right to make decisions about their own life, as long as it's in the child's best interest. The ex's decision to come out to the kids might be a personal choice to be honest with them, which could be seen as responsible parenting. However, the method of disclosure without the other parent's input could be problematic if it causes the children distress or confusion.\n\nThe author's concern about the kids' perception of their marriage is valid, but the ex's sexuality doesn't inherently reflect on the author. However, if the ex is claiming to be gay now, the author might be worried about the children misinterpreting their parents' past relationship. The author's approach of texting and demanding an explanation is a communication method, but the ex's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful for co-parenting.\n\nIn terms of fault, the ex's actions of not consulting the author could be seen as a failure in co-parenting communication. However, the author might have overstepped by demanding an explanation, especially if there's no legal right to do so. The situation is complex, but the ex's decision to come out to the kids is her personal right, and the author's reaction is based on their own feelings rather than the children's best interest. The key here is whether the ex acted in the children's best interest without unnecessary conflict. The author's demand for consultation isn't a legal right unless specified, so they might not be in the wrong for being upset, but the ex might not be wrong for making that choice. The main issue is the lack of communication from the ex. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the ex didn't consult them, but there's a nuance here. However, since the ex has the right to her own life, the author's reaction isn't entirely justified. But given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the ex didn't involve the author in a decision that could affect the children's understanding of family dynamics.\n"
