Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-spouse telling their kids she's gay without consulting the other parent, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and custody agreements. The ex and the author split ten years ago, and they have three kids. The ex didn't inform the author before introducing her sexuality and a girlfriend to the children. The author feels it's not appropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with kids, and he's upset because of what the kids might think about their previous marriage.\n\nIn many places, both parents have the right to be involved in their children's lives, especially regarding major decisions. However, once a divorce is finalized, each parent typically has the right to make decisions about their own family life unless there's a specific custody arrangement that requires consultation. The ex's action might be within her rights if she has sole custody or if the custody agreement doesn't specify such matters. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of how to handle sensitive topics with children. Coming out to kids can be complex, depending on their age and maturity. The ex might have thought it was necessary to be honest about her identity, especially if the kids are teenagers or older. However, the author's concern is valid about the children's perception of their past marriage and the lack of communication.\n\nThe author confronted the ex, but she didn't respond. The key issue here is whether the ex was obligated to consult him. If their custody agreement doesn't require mutual consultation on such matters, the ex might not be in the wrong. However, if there's an understanding that major family decisions should be discussed, then she might have a responsibility to communicate.\n\nAlso, the author's own actions after the divorce\u2014if he did something to contribute to the breakup, as mentioned in the post, it might affect the perception of fairness. But the question is specifically about the ex's action in telling the kids about her sexuality.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, parents usually have the right to live their lives, including their sexual orientation, as long as it's in the best interest of the children. The ex might have felt it was important for the kids to know her true self, especially if they're part of her current life. However, the method of disclosure and the lack of communication could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might not be in the wrong if the ex didn't have a legal or agreed-upon obligation to consult him. The ex's decision could be seen as her right to live her life and be open with the children. However, the lack of communication is a valid point of contention. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex didn't necessarily have to consult him unless specified, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong in this situation.\n"
