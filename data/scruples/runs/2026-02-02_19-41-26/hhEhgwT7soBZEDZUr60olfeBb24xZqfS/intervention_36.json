Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex who told their kids she's gay without consulting the author. The author is upset because they feel the ex didn't consider their feelings or the kids' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex and author are divorced, had a contentious split. They don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex hasn't dated much, but the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex decided to come out to the kids as gay and now has a girlfriend around them. The author feels blindsided and is concerned about the kids' perception and their own past marriage. They confronted the ex, but she didn't respond except to say not to text during her parenting time.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole here. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know the assistant's take. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nNow, considering the situation: The ex is a parent, so she has the right to her identity and to be present as a parent. However, introducing a new partner to children after a divorce is a significant decision. Typically, parents should communicate with co-parents about major life changes that affect the kids. The ex didn't consult the author, which might be a breach of co-parenting cooperation. But the author is also not the ex's parent; the kids need to know their parent's identity.\n\nHowever, the author is making assumptions about the kids' reactions and the ex's intentions. The ex might have felt it was necessary to be honest with the kids. The author's anger could stem from personal issues, like not wanting the kids to question the previous marriage. The ex's refusal to communicate further complicates things.\n\nIn co-parenting scenarios, open communication is vital. If the ex made an important life decision without discussing it with the co-parent, that's problematic. But the author also has a responsibility to support the kids having a relationship with their other parent. However, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset if the ex didn't reach out first. But the ex's actions might have been necessary for the kids to know their parent's truth.\n\nThe key issue is whether the ex had a right to come out to the kids without consulting the author. Legally, each parent can make decisions about their own identity. However, in practice, major life changes affecting the children should be discussed. So maybe the ex is in the wrong for not consulting, but the author is also overreacting. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nThe author is not the one who came out; they're upset about it. The ex is the parent making the decisions. The author's problem is with the ex's lack of communication. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but perhaps the ex is. However, the author's argument that the kids shouldn't be told about their parent's sexuality is questionable. The kids have the right to know their parent's identity. So the author might be in the wrong for opposing the ex's right to be authentic.\n\nBut in the story, the author says they don't think it's acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. That seems like a problematic stance. Parents should be honest with their children, even if it's challenging. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of the ex's identity and possibly harmful to the kids. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not supporting the ex's right to be open with their children and for not engaging in constructive communication. The answer might be A. But I need to make sure.\n"
