Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's ex is telling their kids she's gay, bringing her girlfriend around them, and the author didn't know about it. The author thinks it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with their kids. They confronted the ex, but she didn't respond except to say not to text during her parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children unless there's a court order that limits that. If they share custody, each parent usually has the right to make certain decisions. However, if they have joint custody, maybe they need to consult each other? But the ex didn't consult the author, which is a problem because the author is also a parent. \n\nThe author is upset because the ex is telling the kids she's gay and not bisexaul. The author is worried about the kids' perception. But is it wrong for a parent to come out to their children? I think that depends on the age of the kids. If they're teenagers, maybe it's appropriate, but if they're younger, it might be different. The author says they have three kids, but doesn't specify their ages. Also, the ex didn't consult the author, which is a red flag because the kids are part of both parents' lives. \n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The key points here are: the ex's decision to disclose her sexuality without consulting the other parent, the method of communication (texting and not responding), and the author's role as a parent. The ex's response seems dismissive, which might indicate a problem in their co-parenting relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should ideally discuss significant matters related to the children together. The ex's action of not consulting the author could be seen as a breach of co-parenting etiquette. However, the author's approach of confronting the ex via text and demanding an explanation might be considered confrontational. But given that the ex didn't respond, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the ex had the right to decide on her own, then the author isn't at fault. But if co-parenting requires discussion, then the ex is in the wrong. The author's anger stems from being excluded from an important decision affecting their children. The fact that the ex didn't consult him is a key point. The author isn't being inconsiderate by wanting to know; he's concerned about the kids' well-being and how this might affect their view of his past marriage. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is not in the wrong because the ex made a significant decision without consulting the other parent, which is typically expected in co-parenting situations. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
