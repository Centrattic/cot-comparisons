Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person in the scenario) is wrong for being upset that their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them first.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex wants to come out as gay to their kids and starts bringing a girlfriend around. The author is upset because it wasn't discussed, and they're worried about how the kids perceive the past marriage. The ex didn't answer their messages and just mentioned not being contacted during parenting time unless it's scheduling.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's accurate. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. However, co-parenting often requires communication and mutual respect. The ex might feel that her sexual orientation is a personal matter, but involving the kids in this decision is important. \n\nThe author is concerned about the suddenness and lack of communication. The ex's response of ignoring the messages could exacerbate tension. However, the author's own history of having two long-term girlfriends might not be directly relevant, but it's part of the context. \n\nThe ex's decision to come out to the kids is a personal choice, but she should consider the impact on the children and the other parent. It's reasonable for the author to want to be involved in discussions about the kids' upbringing, even if they're divorced. The fact that the ex didn't consult the author could be seen as a breach of co-parenting cooperation. \n\nHowever, the author's approach might be contributing to the problem. Instead of confronting via text and demanding explanations, a more collaborative approach might be better. Also, the author's statement about not thinking it's acceptable for a parent to discuss sexuality with children might be a personal opinion, but it's not necessarily the case that the ex is wrong. Parents have the right to share their personal lives if it's in the kids' best interest, provided it's age-appropriate and done with care.\n\nSo, the key points are: the ex should have communicated, but the author's approach and judgment about the ex's sexuality might not be justified. The author has a right to be involved, but their method of confrontation and the assumption about the kids' perception of the past marriage could be problematic. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the ex didn't communicate properly, but the author's own handling could be improved. However, the core issue is the lack of communication from the ex. The answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
