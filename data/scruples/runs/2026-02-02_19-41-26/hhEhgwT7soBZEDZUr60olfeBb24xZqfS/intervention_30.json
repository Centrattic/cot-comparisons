Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong after his ex told their kids she's gay without consulting him. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex told the kids she's gay and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. The author feels blindsided and upset because he's concerned about the kids' understanding of their mom's sexuality and how it affects their perception of their own marriage. He confronted her via text, but she didn't respond, just stating not to contact her during parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\n\nSo, the key points here. The ex is a parent, and she made a decision about her personal life that affects their children. The author argues that she didn't consult him, which is a valid point because co-parenting often requires communication. However, the ex has the right to her own identity and relationships. The author's concern is about the kids' perception, thinking they might blame him for the divorce or misunderstand their mom's sexuality.\n\nBut the author is being critical of the ex's decision to \"come out\" to the kids. However, the ex is the parent, so she has the right to discuss her identity with her children. The author might not agree with the timing or method, but the decision to share her sexuality isn't something that requires the other parent's consent, especially if it's her personal life.\n\nThe author is also upset that she identified as gay rather than bisexual, implying that he wants the kids to still have a reference to their previous marriage. But the ex's sexuality is her own, and it's not fair to expect her to present herself in a way that makes the author feel more comfortable. The kids need to understand their parent's truth, even if it's different from what the author wishes.\n\nAs for the author's actions, he sent texts and calls, but the ex is avoiding communication during parenting time. The author is trying to address the issue, which is reasonable, but the ex's response is dismissive. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to discuss it. But the core issue is whether the ex overstepped. Since she's the parent, she has the right to her identity and the responsibility to explain it to the kids, even if it's difficult.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the ex's actions are within her rights as a parent. The author's focus on the kids' perception might be valid, but he can't control her decisions. The main problem is the lack of communication from the ex, not the act of coming out itself. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
