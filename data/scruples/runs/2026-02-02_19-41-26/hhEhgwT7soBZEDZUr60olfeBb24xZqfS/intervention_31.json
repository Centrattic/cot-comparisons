Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex and the author are divorced, had a nasty split, and their kids are involved. The ex decided to come out as gay to the kids and brought her girlfriend around them without discussing it with the author. The author feels blindsided and is upset that the ex didn't consult them, especially since the kids might now think the author is part of the situation. The author confronted the ex but only got vague responses about scheduling. The author is asking if they're in the wrong or if the ex is.\n\nNow, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. My task is to determine if the answer is A (author is in the wrong) or B (author is not in the wrong).\n\nLet me break down the key points. The ex is the parent who is the one coming out as gay. The author is the other parent, who is not in a same-sex relationship. The ex didn't consult the author before telling the kids. The author is upset because this could affect the kids' perception of the family and the marriage. The author is also concerned that the ex didn't consider his feelings or their co-parenting dynamic.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, each parent has the right to make certain decisions about their child's upbringing, but co-parenting often requires communication and mutual respect. However, a parent's sexual orientation is generally considered a personal matter, and coming out to their own children is typically seen as their right. The ex is the parent, so she has the right to discuss her identity with her children. However, the way she did it\u2014without consulting the other parent\u2014could be problematic in a co-parenting context.\n\nThe author is upset because the kids might now think he's part of the situation. But the author isn't the one whose sexuality was in question. The ex's decision to come out to the kids is her personal choice, but in a co-parenting situation, some communication might be expected to avoid confusion. However, the ex didn't just come out to the kids\u2014she also brought her girlfriend around them. That could be a separate issue, but the initial act of coming out to the children is her right.\n\nThe author's problem is more about the lack of communication. The ex didn't consult him, which the author feels was necessary. But is that the author's right to demand? In some ways, the author might be overstepping by expecting the ex to run such a personal decision by him. The ex is a parent, so she has the right to make decisions about her own identity and how to present it to the children.\n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid in terms of the children's well-being. If the children are confused about their family dynamics, it's important for both parents to address it together. But the ex didn't do that. She made the decision unilaterally, which could cause confusion or tension in the kids. The author's response was to confront her via text, but the ex didn't engage beyond scheduling. That could indicate a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, he might feel that the ex was disrespectful by not consulting him. But the ex is a parent, so she has the right to make such personal decisions. The author's issue is with being kept out of the loop, but maybe that's his own responsibility as a co-parent to communicate openly. However, the ex's response of only talking about scheduling during parenting time is dismissive, which could be problematic.\n\nThe key here is whether the ex had the right to come out to the kids without discussing it with the other parent. Legally, yes, because it's her identity. But in terms of co-parenting, communication is important. The ex's approach was abrupt and uncooperative, which might have been the wrong way to handle it, even if the decision itself was her right.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If the author is the one demanding that the ex consult him about a personal decision, then maybe he is. The ex's sexual orientation is her personal matter, not something the author has a say in. However, the author's concern about the kids' perception is valid, but that's something the ex should have considered. The author's response (texting and demanding an explanation) could be seen as overstepping, especially if the ex felt it was her right to make that decision alone. However, the ex not engaging in the conversation at all is also contributing to the problem.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, co-parents often need to work together to present a united front for the kids' sake. The ex's unilateral decision might have been poorly handled, but it doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. The author is upset because he wasn't informed, but he might not have a right to expect that. However, the author's reaction (texting demands) could be seen as confrontational, which might not be the best approach.\n\nPutting this all together, the ex made a personal decision without consulting the co-parent, which the author felt was necessary. The author's actions were to confront the ex, which might be within his rights as a co-parent to express concerns, but the ex's refusal to engage beyond scheduling is another issue. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings about a decision that affects the children. However, the ex also has the right to her own identity and decisions. It's a complicated situation, but the author's main issue is the lack of communication, which is a co-parenting problem. So, the answer might lean towards B (author is not in the wrong) because the ex's actions were unilaterally made without considering the co-parenting dynamic, but the author's reaction could be seen as appropriate in a co-parenting context where communication is expected.\n"
