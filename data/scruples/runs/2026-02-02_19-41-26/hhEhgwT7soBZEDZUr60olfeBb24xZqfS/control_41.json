Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong after their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex and author are divorced after a messy split. They have three kids and don't get along well but try to co-parent. The ex didn't date much, but the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex came out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around, without discussing it with the author. The author is upset because they think the ex shouldn't discuss her sexuality with the kids and is worried about how the kids perceive the author's past marriage. The ex isn't responding to the author's texts.\n\nNow, considering legal and social norms. In most places, both parents have the right to make decisions regarding their child's upbringing, including discussions about their sexuality. However, since it's a shared custody situation, the ex might be responsible for discussing her sexuality if she's the parent currently with the kids. But the author is upset that they weren't informed. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the ex didn't consult them. But if the kids are with the ex, she might feel it's her responsibility to be honest with them about her identity. However, in a co-parenting setup, major decisions affecting the children usually require mutual agreement. The author might have a right to be informed, especially if the kids are young and the topic is sensitive.\n\nBut wait, the ex didn't consult the author. The author argues that discussing sexuality isn't appropriate for kids. However, the ex's sexuality could be relevant if the kids are asking questions or if the ex sees it as part of her role to be truthful. Also, the ex's girlfriend being around the kids might require some coordination between the parents.\n\nThe author's problem is that the ex didn't check with them first. But in a split custody situation, each parent has the authority to make certain decisions while the child is in their care. However, if the topic is significant and could affect both parents' roles, communication is key. The ex's lack of communication is problematic, but the author's accusation that the ex is wrong for discussing it might depend on the children's age and context.\n\nIf the kids are old enough to understand, the ex might have a valid reason to come out to them. However, the ex should have discussed this with the co-parent to ensure consistency and avoid confusion. The author isn't wrong for being upset about not being consulted, especially if they have a shared custody arrangement. \n\nSo, the ex might be in the wrong for not communicating, and the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any aspect where the author's stance is problematic. The author's claim that it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children seems like a personal opinion. The ex might have a valid reason to tell the kids, but the method (without consulting) is an issue. The author isn't wrong for objecting to the lack of consultation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
