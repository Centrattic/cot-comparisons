She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an ex who told their kids she's gay and started bringing her girlfriend around them without consulting the author. The author is upset and thinks the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, after a divorce, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's lives. However, when it comes to matters like this, it might depend on custody arrangements. If it's joint custody or shared parenting time, the ex might have the right to make decisions during her time with the kids. But maybe the author feels that such a personal decision should be discussed with the other parent to avoid confusion for the children.\n\nThe author mentions that the ex didn't consult him, which is a key point. Parents should communicate about important issues affecting the children. Not discussing such a significant personal matter could lead to inconsistency between households. For example, if the author and his ex present different narratives about family matters, the kids might get confused or feel pressured to take sides.\n\nHowever, the ex's right to her own identity is important too. Coming out is a personal matter, and if she feels comfortable doing so during her parenting time, there's an argument that she has the right to be authentic around her children. The problem arises if the way she communicated it caused unnecessary stress or if it's not age-appropriate for the kids' maturity level.\n\nThe author is also concerned about the kids thinking negatively about their previous marriage. This implies that the ex's disclosure might be framed in a way that's critical of the author. If the ex is using this to shift the narrative or blame the author for the divorce, that could be problematic. But if she's just being honest about her identity without badmouthing the author, it's a different scenario.\n\nAnother angle is the author's response. He confronted her via text and demanded explanations. His approach might come off as confrontational, which isn't helpful in a situation that requires cooperation for the children's sake. The ex not responding could be her way of maintaining boundaries, especially if the author is being hostile.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's becoming more accepted for parents to discuss their sexuality with their children, but the manner and timing matter. If the kids are old enough to understand, the ex might have a right to be open about her identity. However, if the kids are younger, this could be more complex, and the parent should consider the child's emotional readiness.\n\nLegal perspectives might vary, but generally, unless there's a court order specifying certain conditions, each parent has rights during their designated time. The key issue here is communication and mutual respect. The ex's decision to not discuss it with the author could be seen as a failure to collaborate, but the author's accusatory tone might also be contributing to the breakdown in communication.\n\nIn summary, both parties might have some faults. The ex didn't consult the author, which is a valid concern, but the author's approach to confronting her might not be effective. The main wrong here could be the lack of communication from the ex, but the author's reaction might also be part of the problem. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, it's possible that he isn't, because he's trying to protect the children's well-being and is upset about being blindsided. However, if the ex had a right to make that decision during her parenting time, then maybe the author is overstepping. This is a bit of a gray area. But given that the ex didn't consult him and the author is trying to address it, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong (B), because the ex should have communicated, and the author's concern is valid.\n"
