Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-spouse told their children she's gay without consulting the author, and he's upset about it. He also mentions that the divorce was messy and they don't get along well, but they try to co-parent the three kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, including matters related to their personal lives. However, if there's a custody arrangement or specific parenting plans, there might be guidelines about how decisions are made. Since the author mentions that they don't get along, maybe there's a history of conflict that affects their co-parenting.\n\nThe author is upset that his ex didn't consult him and that she chose to identify as gay rather than bisexual, implying that the kids might have misunderstandings. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: did the ex have the right to share her sexual orientation with the kids without consulting him?\n\nFrom a rights perspective, each parent has the right to their own identity and to express it, especially if it's relevant to their role as a parent. However, when it comes to children, parents should be considerate of each other's roles and perhaps discuss such matters if they could impact the children's perception of the other parent. The author's issue is that his ex's revelation might make the kids question their previous understanding of their family dynamics.\n\nBut from the ex's standpoint, she might feel that her identity is a part of who she is, and sharing it with the kids could be important for her being authentic, especially if she's now in a same-sex relationship. The fact that she didn't consult him could be seen as dismissive, but she might believe it's her personal right to disclose that information.\n\nLegally, there's no law that prevents a parent from discussing their sexual orientation with their children unless there's a court order restricting contact or specific parenting agreements. The author's reaction is based on the suddenness of the disclosure and the potential impact on the kids. However, the ex's decision to come out as gay isn't inherently wrong. If the author had concerns about how the kids would perceive him, that's more about his insecurities or the history of the divorce rather than the ex's actions being in the wrong.\n\nThe author's approach to confronting her via text and demanding explanations could be seen as confrontational, especially given the history of a nasty divorce. The ex's response was to not engage further, which might be her way of protecting her parenting time. The author's main argument is that she didn't consult him, but if there's no legal requirement for that, then she isn't in the wrong. The author's own past actions (he admits he fucked up) might contribute to the current situation, making him more at fault for the strained relationship and not setting clear boundaries earlier.\n\nIn terms of co-parenting, communication is key. The author could have addressed his concerns earlier if he had them, but instead, he's upset now after the fact. The ex's choice to share her identity isn't something he can control unless there's a specific agreement in place. Therefore, the author's anger is more about the lack of communication from the ex, but she isn't necessarily wrong for making that choice. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance. Wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but after analyzing, maybe the ex is at fault for not consulting, but the author's reaction is justified? Hmm. Or maybe the author is wrong because the ex has the right to her identity. So the answer could be B (author not in the wrong) because the ex is in the wrong for not consulting, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is correct in being upset, then he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
