Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong when their ex-spouse told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The author is upset because the ex didn't talk to them first and is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex didn't date much after the split, but the author had two long-term girlfriends. The ex decided to come out as gay to the kids, not bisexual, which might imply something about the author's past relationship. The author feels that it's not appropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children, and they wanted to have that conversation themselves. The ex didn't respond to the author's messages beyond scheduling issues.\n\nHmm, the main issue is about the ex sharing her sexuality with the kids without the author's input. But who is wrong here? The author is upset about not being consulted and the way it was handled. The ex might feel that she has the right to be open with the kids as a parent. However, in co-parenting situations, especially after a contentious divorce, communication is key. The author might have a valid point about wanting to discuss this with the kids themselves, but the ex might also feel that she has the right to be authentic around her children.\n\nBut the author is blaming the ex for dropping a bombshell without discussion. The ex's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful. However, the act of being honest about one's sexuality to children isn't inherently wrong. It's more about how it was communicated. The ex didn't consult the co-parent, which complicates things. Co-parents usually need to coordinate major decisions about the kids' lives. But is a parent's personal identity a major decision? Some might argue it's part of the parent's identity and relevant to the kids' understanding.\n\nThe author's main complaint is about being blindsided and the potential impact on the kids. The ex's choice to present as gay instead of bisexual might make the kids wonder about the author's sexuality, which adds to the author's frustration. But is the author wrong for being upset? Or is the ex wrong for not discussing it first?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, co-parents should communicate about important issues. The ex's lack of communication is problematic. However, the ex has a right to her identity and may feel that being honest with her children is necessary. The author might need to handle the fallout with the kids, but the ex's approach could have been better. However, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset; the ex is the one who didn't coordinate. But the question is who is \"in the wrong\" in the AITA context. \n\nAITA questions often look at who acted unreasonably. The author is upset about not being consulted and the potential impact on the kids. The ex acted without discussing, which is a breach of co-parenting norms. So, the ex might be more in the wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to discuss it and being upset. They might not be wrong for their reaction. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
