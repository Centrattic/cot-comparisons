Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The situation is a bit complex because it involves co-parenting, past issues in the divorce, and the sudden revelation of the ex's sexuality to the children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their own lives, including their sexual orientation, but when it comes to children, communication between co-parents is crucial. The ex didn't consult the author, which might be a point of contention. However, the ex's choice to come out as bisexual versus gay is mentioned, which could imply some intentional messaging. The author is upset about the children's perception of him and their marriage, but that's more about their own feelings than the act of the ex coming out.\n\nNext, the author's approach. They confronted the ex via text, which might not be the best method for such a sensitive issue. The ex's response was to limit communication to scheduling during her parenting time, which could indicate she believes the matter is settled. The author's demand for an explanation and lack of response from the ex might show that the ex is unwilling to engage, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, children have the right to know their parents' truths, especially if it affects their identity and family dynamics. However, the method of disclosure is important. The ex may have a right to her own identity, but co-parents should ideally communicate to protect the children's well-being. The author's anger about the children's potential confusion is valid, but perhaps the ex's unilateral decision is the issue here.\n\nLegally, unless there's a court order specifying that certain decisions require mutual agreement, the ex can make her own decisions about her personal life. However, in co-parenting, collaboration is usually recommended. The author's attempt to address it and the ex's refusal to engage might mean the author isn't wrong in seeking communication. But was it necessary to ask for her permission to come out? That's a gray area. The ex's identity is her own, but involving the kids is a shared responsibility.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but expecting the ex to consult them could be a stretch unless there's a prior agreement. On the other hand, the ex's choice to disclose without discussion might be careless. The key is whether the author has any legal standing to object. If the ex is a parent, she can share her identity with the kids, but the author's concern about the kids' perceptions is about their own narrative, which isn't something the ex is obligated to consider unless it's harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is more about the ex's unilateral action. The answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
