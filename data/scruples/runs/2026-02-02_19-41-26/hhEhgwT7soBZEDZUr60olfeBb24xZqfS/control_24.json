She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex-spouse who came out as gay to their kids without discussing it with the author first. The author feels blindsided and is upset because the kids might think something about his past marriage. The ex is bringing her girlfriend around the kids now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex and author split ten years ago, and their divorce was contentious. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term relationships. The key issue is the ex's decision to come out to the children without consulting the author. The author argues that parents shouldn't discuss their sexuality with kids, and the ex didn't even inform him. The ex's response was dismissive, only talking about scheduling during parenting time.\n\nNow, thinking about the rights and responsibilities of co-parents. After a divorce, both parents usually have joint custody, especially regarding major decisions affecting the children. However, coming out to the kids about one's sexuality isn't necessarily a custody decision, but it's a significant personal matter that affects the family dynamic. The ex might feel it's her right to introduce her partner to the kids, but did she need the author's consent? Or is it her choice as a parent?\n\nThe author is upset because the kids might have questions about their past. If the ex was bisexual, the kids might question the author's past, but the ex chose to say she's gay. The author might feel this could lead to confusion or stigma. However, the ex's right to her identity is also important. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, in many places, neither parent has sole authority over the child's upbringing unless there's a court order specifying that. So the ex might not be in the wrong for introducing her partner, but perhaps she should have considered the author's perspective. However, the author's stance that parents shouldn't discuss their sexuality with kids is questionable. Some might argue that it's important for the children to understand their parent's identity, especially if they are older and capable of understanding.\n\nThe ex's response was dismissive, which could indicate a lack of consideration. However, the author's approach via text might not have been the best method. Confrontational texts might not lead to productive conversations, especially if the other parent is already defensive. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't do anything to prevent the ex from living her life, but the ex made a unilateral decision. The author's reaction might stem from feeling that the kids' well-being is being compromised, but the ex's action is about her own identity. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? If the ex has the right to her identity and the kids are old enough to understand, then the ex isn't necessarily wrong. However, if the children are still young and the topic was introduced without considering the author's input, maybe the ex should have discussed it. But the author's argument that parents shouldn't discuss their sexuality with kids is debatable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The ex made a decision that affects the entire family without consultation, which is problematic. The author's concern about the kids' understanding and the potential impact on their perception of the past marriage is valid. However, the ex's right to her identity is also important. But in terms of fault, the ex's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, so the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
