Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the ex-spouse told their kids she's gay, brought her girlfriend around them, and didn't consult the author. The author is upset because they think it's not appropriate to discuss sexuality with kids.\n\nFirst, the ex and the author are divorced and don't get along well. The ex didn't talk to the author before coming out to the kids. The author is worried about what the kids think about him and their marriage. The ex's response was pretty dismissive, saying not to text during parenting time unless it's about scheduling, and she didn't explain her actions.\n\nNow, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children, but when it comes to a parent's personal life, like their sexual orientation, it's more about the child's well-being. Parents have the right to their own identity, so coming out to their own children might be seen as their right. However, the way it was done without consulting the other parent could be an issue, especially if the kids are minors and the other parent has a say in their upbringing.\n\nThe author is upset about the kids thinking about him. Maybe he's worried about confusing the kids or how they'll view their family structure. But the ex has her own identity, and coming out is a personal matter. However, introducing a girlfriend without the other parent's input might be abrupt. The author's reaction is to confront the ex via text, but she didn't respond. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for being upset.\n\nLegally, in some jurisdictions, both parents have a right to make decisions for the child, but the ex's personal life is her own. However, when it comes to the kids, the court might consider what's in their best interest. If the ex is the one making the decisions during her parenting time, she might have the right to introduce her partner. The author's issue is more about the lack of communication and the method of disclosure.\n\nEthically, the ex might have a responsibility to consider the other parent's feelings, especially if the kids are young and might have questions. But the ex's right to her own identity is also important. The author's anger might be misplaced if he's not the one in the wrong here. The fact that he's asking if he's in the wrong suggests he might be overreacting. The ex not consulting him could be a problem, but the act of coming out to the kids isn't necessarily wrong. The author's focus on how the kids perceive him might indicate he's projecting his own insecurities or past issues into the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for his reaction. The ex has a right to her identity and her parenting decisions, even if she didn't consult him. The author's approach of confronting via text and demanding explanations might not be the best way to handle it, especially if the ex was in her parenting time. The answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) if we consider that the ex didn't communicate, but if the ex has the right to make those decisions, then maybe the author is overreacting. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I think the ex might have done something that affects the kids without consulting the other parent, but coming out is a personal right. The author's reaction might be valid in terms of wanting to be informed, but not in terms of being \"in the wrong.\" So maybe B, the author isn't in the wrong because the ex shouldn't have done that without talking to him first. But I'm not sure. Some people might say parents have the right to make those decisions for their own time with the kids. I'm a bit torn. Maybe the answer is B because the author isn't wrong for being upset that his ex didn't communicate, but the ex might have the right to make those decisions. Alternatively, the author is in the wrong because he's projecting his issues onto the kids and the ex's decision is her own. I need to decide based on typical perspectives. Usually, in such cases, the parent has the right to their identity, so the author might be in the wrong for his reaction. Wait, but if the ex didn't communicate, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B.\n"
