Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author's ex told the kids she's gay and brought her girlfriend around them without consulting him. The author feels it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children and is upset that it might affect how the kids view their previous marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. After a divorce, both parents still have responsibilities towards their children. However, decisions about personal matters like sexuality might be seen as the parent's own, unless it directly affects the children's well-being. The ex didn't consult the author, which could be an issue if it's a shared custody situation. But the ex is a parent, so she might have the right to her own identity and relationships. \n\nThe author's main concerns are about the kids' perception and the lack of communication. However, the ex might believe that her sexuality is part of her identity that the kids should know, especially if she's in their lives. The author's reaction might be seen as controlling or not respecting the ex's autonomy. \n\nBut then, the kids are involved, so the parent should consider how to present this information appropriately. The ex might have had the kids at a certain age where they can understand, and it's part of being honest about her identity. The author's anger could stem from his own insecurities about the past marriage or fear of the kids being confused. \n\nLegally, unless the ex's actions are harmful to the children, the author might not have grounds to object. The ex's right to her own relationships and identity is important. However, communication between parents is crucial, even if they're separated. The ex's refusal to discuss it might be a problem on her end, but the initial act of coming out to the kids could be her choice as a parent. \n\nThe author's argument that it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children is debatable. Many parents do talk to their kids about their own relationships and identities, especially as the kids grow older. The key is whether it's done in an age-appropriate way. If the ex did it suddenly without preparation, that could be a problem. But the author isn't providing context on how the kids reacted or how it was presented. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong if the ex didn't communicate properly. But if the ex's actions were abrupt and didn't consider the kids' maturity level, that's her fault. However, the author's own past issues (like the nasty divorce and his infidelity) might affect his ability to handle the situation objectively. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at who has the higher responsibility. The ex, as the parent, might have the right to her identity, but should have discussed it with the co-parent. The author is upset about lack of communication but might be overstepping by judging the ex's personal life. The answer might hinge on whether the author had a right to object to the ex's personal choices in the first place, especially if it's not affecting the kids directly. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the ex didn't communicate and made a unilateral decision that affects shared parenting. But the ex's actions could be seen as her right as a parent. However, given the context, the author's concern about sudden changes and lack of discussion is valid. Maybe the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
