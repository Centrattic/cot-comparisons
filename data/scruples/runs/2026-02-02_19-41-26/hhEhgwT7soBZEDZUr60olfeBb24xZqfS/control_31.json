Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay. The ex did this without consulting the author, and now he's upset because the kids might think he's something he's not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex and author had a bad divorce ten years ago. The ex hasn't dated much, but the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex decided to come out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around without discussing it with the author. He's upset about the lack of communication and the possible impact on the kids.\n\nNow, the key points here are the ex's decision to share her sexuality with the kids without consulting the other parent. In many cases, when parents are divorced, they need to collaborate on major decisions affecting the children. So, if the ex made a significant life decision that could influence the kids' perception of their family dynamics, not informing the other parent might be problematic.\n\nThe author is concerned that the kids might associate his past marriage with this revelation, which could confuse them. However, the ex's right to live her life and be open about her sexuality is a valid point. But the method of disclosure is an issue here. Without prior discussion, it can lead to conflict and potential distress for the children, especially if they have to navigate differing perspectives from each parent.\n\nThe ex's response\u2014only talking about scheduling\u2014seems dismissive of the author's concerns. This lack of communication exacerbates the problem. The author is reacting to a unilateral decision, which might not be his fault. He's not the one who made the choice without consultation; he's the one being left out of the loop.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing, including aspects of their lives that affect the children. However, if the ex is the custodial parent, her rights might outweigh the non-custodial parent's in certain contexts. But since the situation is a joint custody scenario (they try to be for the kids), both should have a say.\n\nThe author's anger stems from not being involved in a decision that could impact the kids' understanding of their family. The ex's action, while her right, might have been handled better with communication. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the lack of consultation. He's not the one who made the unilateral decision. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
