Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-spouse who, after a messy divorce, decided to come out as gay to their children without consulting the other parent. The author feels blindsided and upset that this information was given to the kids without discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, including matters related to family dynamics. However, if the ex is a legal parent, they do have the right to be present in the children's lives. But when it comes to disclosing personal information like sexual orientation, especially in a co-parenting context, communication is key.\n\nThe original poster (OP) is upset because the ex didn't consult them. But is OP in the wrong for expecting consultation? Well, in co-parenting situations, it's generally considered best practice to communicate important matters that affect the children. The ex's decision to come out as gay to the kids is a significant personal matter, and while it's their right to be open about their identity, sharing it with the children without the other parent's input might have been abrupt. However, the ex might have had their reasons for doing so, especially if they felt it was important for the children to know the truth.\n\nThe OP also mentions that the ex is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids. The issue here is whether the ex had the right to do that without consulting OP. Legally, if the ex has custody or visitation rights, they can bring dates around the kids, but again, communication is important to ensure consistency in how the children are informed.\n\nThe OP's reaction includes confronting the ex via text, which the ex ignored. The key point here is whether the ex's actions were harmful to the children. If the ex's disclosure was done in a sensitive manner, maybe OP's outrage is misplaced. However, if the disclosure was done in a way that confused the children or made them question their parent's past, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the OP admits they \"fucked up\" in the marriage and the divorce was nasty. This might affect how the co-parenting relationship is perceived. The ex's decision could also be a way to assert autonomy post-divorce, especially if OP was the one who caused the split.\n\nBut ethically, when it comes to children, both parents should work together to present a united front, especially on matters that could affect the children's understanding of their family. The ex's decision to come out without discussion might have been a mistake, but the OP's reaction\u2014demanding an explanation via text and calls\u2014might not be the most effective way to handle it. However, OP is not in the wrong for wanting to discuss it, especially if they feel it impacts the children's well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the ex might have had the right to come out, the lack of communication from the ex could be seen as a co-parenting failure. However, the OP's expectation of consultation is reasonable, so the ex might be at fault here. But the OP's approach might also be confrontational. The answer hinges on whether the ex's actions were done in a way that was harmful versus the OP's right to be informed. Given that the ex didn't consult, the answer might lean towards the ex being at fault, but the question is whether the OP is in the wrong. Since the OP is the one asking if they are in the wrong, and given that they are reacting to the ex's actions, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
