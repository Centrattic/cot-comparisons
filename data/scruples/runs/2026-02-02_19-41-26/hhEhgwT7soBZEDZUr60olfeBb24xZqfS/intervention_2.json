Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the original situation is in the wrong. The question is between answer A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a parent who is divorced from their ex. They have three kids. The ex didn't date much after the divorce, but the author had two long-term girlfriends. Now, the ex told the kids she's gay and is bringing her girlfriend around them without consulting the author. The author is upset because they think it's not appropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids, and they feel blindsided. They confronted the ex, but she didn't respond beyond scheduling issues. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) here.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nThe key points here are: the ex made a decision to come out to the kids without consulting the other parent. The author is upset about this. The question is about whether the author is wrong for being upset or if the ex was wrong in making that decision without discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children, even after divorce. So if the ex made a significant life decision (like coming out) that affects the children, not informing the other parent might be an issue. However, the ex is also a parent, so maybe she has the right to her own identity and to be present as her authentic self around the children.\n\nBut the author's issue is that the ex told the kids she's gay, not bisexual, which might imply something negative about the author's past marriage. The author worries that the kids are confused or have negative thoughts. However, the ex's sexuality is her own business. The author's main grievance is about not being consulted and the sudden change in the kids' understanding of their mom's relationship status.\n\nNow, considering the kids' age might matter, but it's not specified. If the kids are teenagers, maybe they can handle such information. If they're younger, it might be more complex. But since the author didn't mention the ages, it's hard to assess that angle.\n\nThe ex's response to the author's texts was dismissive. She said not to text during parenting time unless about scheduling. Then when the author asked why she didn't consult him, she didn't respond. That seems like poor communication on her part. But the author is upset because he wasn't included in the decision-making process regarding something significant.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? The author is a parent who has a right to be informed about major changes in the child's environment. If the ex is now in a relationship, it's reasonable for the author to expect that information to be shared, especially if it's being shared with the kids. However, the ex also has the right to her own identity and to be present as herself with the children. There's a balance between a parent's right to privacy and the other parent's right to be informed.\n\nIn terms of the kids, it's important for them to know their parents for who they are. So maybe the ex was right to come out to them, even without consulting the author. But the lack of communication between the co-parents is problematic. The author is upset because he wasn't given a chance to process this information or discuss it with the ex beforehand.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's grievance is about the lack of consultation, which is a valid concern. However, the ex's decision to come out is her personal right. The author's reaction might be based on personal discomfort or fear of what the kids might think, but that's not necessarily the ex's responsibility. If the ex felt that it was important for the kids to know her true self, that's her choice. The author's problem is more about the method (not consulting) rather than the content (her sexuality).\n\nHowever, the author's argument that the ex didn't ask his opinion is valid in the context of co-parenting. Both parents should ideally discuss significant matters related to the children. But coming out to the children is a personal decision, and maybe it's not something the author has a say in. The line is blurry here.\n\nIn terms of answer A (author is wrong) vs. B (not wrong). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe he's not. The author is upset about not being consulted, which is a co-parenting issue. However, the ex's decision to be her authentic self around the kids is also valid. The author's being upset might not be the wrong part, but perhaps the ex's approach was flawed. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is wrong for being upset, that would be answer A. If not, answer B.\n\nGiven that the ex didn't consult him, but also that it's her right to be open with the kids, maybe the author isn't wrong. He has a right to be informed, but his reaction might be seen as overstepping. However, he's not in the wrong for being upset. The ex is wrong for not consulting him. So the answer would be B (author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the author is wrong because the ex has the right to come out to the kids without needing permission, then maybe answer B. The author's issue is with the lack of communication, but the ex's action is her right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, while the ex is wrong for not discussing it. So answer B.\n"
