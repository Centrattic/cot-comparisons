She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-spouse told their kids she's gay and started bringing her girlfriend around without consulting the author. The author is upset about being blindsided and is questioning their own actions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex and the author split 10 years ago. The divorce was bad, and they don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex didn't date much, but the author had two long-term relationships. Now, the ex came out as gay to the kids without discussing it with the author first. The author didn't think it's appropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. They tried to confront the ex via text but got a dismissive reply, and she didn't answer further questions.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or the ex is (B). The answer should be A or B. \n\nHmm. The author is upset that the ex made that announcement without consulting them. But is the author wrong for being upset? Well, the ex is a parent, so their sexuality isn't something the author can control. The kids are now involved, so the ex made a choice to be open with them. The author might feel blindsided, but the ex has the right to her identity and to share it with her children. The author's issue seems to be about not being informed first. However, in co-parenting situations, it's important to communicate, but the ex might feel that the kids need to know her truth. \n\nThe author is arguing that it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. But isn't it appropriate for a parent to be honest about their identity, especially if they're involved in their children's lives? The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the kids. Also, the fact that the ex didn't want to discuss it when the author tried to reach out is problematic, but maybe the author's initial reaction is based on their own insecurities about the kids' perception of them and their past marriage. \n\nSo, the ex is being honest about her identity to her children, which is her right. The author is upset about not being informed first, but the ex isn't required to get the author's permission. The author might be in the wrong for expecting the ex to consult them about personal matters. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). Wait, no. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the ex's actions are acceptable, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. But is the author wrong for being upset? Or is the ex wrong for not consulting?\n\nThe core issue is about communication. The ex chose to come out to the kids without discussing with the other parent. However, the ex's identity is her own, and she has the right to express that. The author's problem is not with the ex being gay but with being told without prior discussion. In co-parenting, it's expected to discuss major decisions that affect the kids, but the ex's sexuality is part of her identity that affects how the kids see her. But the author's reaction is about not wanting the kids to think the marriage was based on lies. However, the author might be overstepping by expecting the ex to get their approval. \n\nThe ex's response was dismissive, but the author isn't in the wrong for confronting her about the lack of communication. So, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because the ex should have communicated better, and the author's concern is valid regarding the children's well-being and their own situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
