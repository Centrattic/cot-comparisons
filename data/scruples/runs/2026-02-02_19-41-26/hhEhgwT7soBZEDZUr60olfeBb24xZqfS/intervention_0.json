Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong when their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them. The author feels it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children and didn't agree with how the ex handled it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's lives, including their own personal relationships. However, when divorced, there's often a co-parenting agreement. The author's ex might have the right to introduce her partner to the kids, especially if it's part of her lifestyle now. But the issue here is that the ex didn't communicate with the author first, which is a common problem in co-parenting situations where communication breaks down.\n\nThe author is upset because the ex chose to label herself as gay instead of bisexual, which might affect how the kids perceive the author's past. But the author's main issue is the lack of communication and the sudden revelation. However, the ex's decision to come out to the kids is her personal choice, and the author might not have a legal right to control that. \n\nLegally, unless there's a court order specifying otherwise, parents can make decisions about their own relationships and their involvement with the children. The author's ex has the right to be honest about her identity, even if it upsets the other parent. The problem here is more about communication and mutual respect in co-parenting rather than the act of coming out itself.\n\nThe author's argument that discussing sexuality isn't acceptable with kids might be a personal opinion. However, many experts suggest that if a parent is in a committed relationship, children deserve to know the truth to avoid confusion. The author's ex might have thought it was necessary to be honest with the kids about her relationship status.\n\nThe ex's response to the author's texts\u2014only discussing scheduling\u2014shows a breakdown in communication. The author's frustration is valid, but the core issue is the lack of dialogue. However, the author is in the wrong if they believe they can control the ex's decision to come out to their children. The ex's actions are about her identity and her relationship with the kids, not the author's past. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are understandable, the ex is within her rights to be open about her sexuality to the children. The author's main grievance is about not being consulted, but co-parenting requires mutual respect and communication, which were lacking here. So the author is in the wrong for expecting the ex to seek their approval on a personal matter.\n"
