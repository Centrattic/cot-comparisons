Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong after their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple divorced ten years ago after a messy split. They have three kids and don't get along well but try for the kids' sake. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex came out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around, which the author didn't expect. The author is upset because the ex didn't consult them and chose to say \"gay\" instead of \"bisexual,\" which makes them worry about what the kids think about their past marriage. The author confronted the ex via text, but the ex only mentioned not texting during parenting time unless it's about scheduling. The author then sent another text demanding an explanation, but the ex didn't respond.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The ex made a significant life decision (coming out) and shared it with the kids without consulting the other parent. The author is concerned about how this affects the kids and their perception of the author's former relationship. The ex's response seems dismissive, focusing on scheduling rather than the author's concerns. \n\nIn co-parenting situations, communication is key, especially when it comes to major decisions affecting the children. While the ex has the right to live her life and choose her partner, involving the kids in her personal life without the other parent's input could be problematic. The author's concern is valid because the kids might be confused about their mother's identity and how it reflects on their father's past. However, the author's approach of confronting via text might not be effective, especially if the ex is unresponsive. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't hiding their new relationships, but the ex's disclosure was unilateral. The author's actions (texting to demand an explanation) are about seeking clarity, which is understandable. The ex's refusal to engage beyond scheduling could be seen as avoiding the issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset or seeking communication. The ex's actions might be the main issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
