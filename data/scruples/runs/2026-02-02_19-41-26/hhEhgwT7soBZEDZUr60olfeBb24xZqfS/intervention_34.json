Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is about an ex who told their kids she's gay without consulting the author. The author is upset because they think the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the children and now brings her girlfriend around them. The ex didn't communicate this beforehand.\n\nFirst, the author mentions the divorce was nasty and long, and they don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The key points are the ex coming out to the kids, not consulting the author, and the author feeling the kids might think badly about him and their marriage because she said gay instead of bisexual.\n\nI need to consider the rights of each parent. In many places, both parents have rights to their children unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. The ex is a parent, so she might have the right to share her personal life with the kids she's responsible for during her parenting time. However, bringing a romantic partner around the kids could be a different matter, depending on the children's ages and the circumstances.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the ex didn't consult him. But the ex did act during her parenting time, so maybe the author has no authority in that situation. The author's argument is that discussing sexuality with children isn't acceptable, but if the ex was trying to be honest with the kids, maybe that's her right. Also, the author's own actions (having girlfriends) don't directly relate to the ex's situation.\n\nThe ex's response to the author's texts seems dismissive, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the ex is within her rights to inform the kids during her time with them, then the author might be overstepping by objecting. However, if the kids are minors and the ex is making such a significant life decision without considering the other parent's input, that could be problematic.\n\nBut in co-parenting situations, especially without a custody agreement that gives the other parent authority over such matters, the ex might have the right to make decisions during her parenting time. Unless there's a legal agreement specifying otherwise, the author might not have a say in what the ex tells the kids during her time with them. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expecting input that wasn't required.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (author not in the wrong) if the ex is overstepping, but considering the co-parenting dynamics and the ex's right to her own identity disclosure, maybe the answer is A (author in the wrong). Wait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me check again.\n\nThe ex is a parent; she has the right to discuss her own identity with her children. The author doesn't have control over her parenting time. The issue is the author's expectation that the ex should have consulted him. Since the ex is the other parent, she might have the right to make such decisions without needing the author's approval. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for trying to control another parent's decisions during their own parenting time. So the answer is A.\n"
