She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-spouse coming out as gay to their kids without consulting the other parent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The ex and the author split ten years ago, had a nasty divorce. They have three kids and try to co-parent despite not getting along. The ex didn't date much, while the author had two long-term relationships. The ex told the kids she's gay and brought her girlfriend around them without discussing it with the author. The author feels the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids and is upset about it. The ex didn't respond to the author's messages about the issue.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The main question is about the ex's actions versus the author's reaction. The author is upset that the ex didn't consult him, but the ex might have a right to her own identity and to be honest with the kids. However, the age of the kids is a factor. The author didn't mention their ages, which could be important. If the kids are teenagers, maybe they can handle the information, but if they're younger, it might be more complex.\n\nBut generally, a parent does have the right to discuss their personal life with their children, especially if it's part of their identity. The ex might feel it's important for the kids to know her true self. That said, not consulting the other parent could be seen as dismissive, especially in a co-parenting situation. However, the author's approach to confronting the ex via text and demanding an explanation might come off as controlling. The ex's response about not texting during parenting time suggests she's in a meeting with the kids, so the timing might be inappropriate.\n\nThe author is upset about the kids possibly thinking he's involved in the ex's sexuality or that their marriage was a lie. But the author's past actions (cheating, leading to a nasty divorce) might make it harder to argue that the ex shouldn't discuss her sexuality. The key here is whether the ex had the right to share her identity with the kids without consulting the other parent, versus the author's right to be informed.\n\nIn many cases, co-parents are encouraged to communicate about major topics affecting the children. However, a parent's sexual orientation is a personal aspect of their identity, and withholding that from children might be considered harmful. The ex might believe it's important for the kids to know her true self, especially if they're old enough. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating the ex's identity, which might not be fair. However, the ex's lack of communication about this significant change could be problematic.\n\nBut since the author is the one who cheated and caused the divorce, his criticism of the ex's actions might be seen as hypocritical. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author had multiple relationships. The author's main issue is about the kids' perspective, but the ex's decision to come out might be her own right. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset about not being consulted, but the ex's actions might not be wrong either. However, the author's approach to confronting the ex via text and demanding an explanation could be seen as aggressive, especially if the ex is in the middle of parenting time. The ex's non-response might be because she's focusing on the kids during her time with them.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might not be in the wrong, but the ex's actions could be contentious. However, the author is likely in the wrong because the ex has the right to her identity and discuss it with her children. The author's reaction might be more about his own insecurities or past mistakes rather than the kids' best interests. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, but I'm a bit conflicted. Wait, actually, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the ex has the right to come out to her kids, then the author's criticism is unfounded, so he's not in the wrong? Wait no, if the ex did the right thing, then the author is the one being wrong. Wait, the question is \"Is the author in the wrong?\" So if the ex did something wrong, then the author is not in the wrong. If the ex did nothing wrong, then the author is in the wrong for being upset. But given that the ex came out to her kids, which is a personal right, the author might be in the wrong for criticizing her. But co-parenting requires communication. The answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the ex's autonomy. This is tricky. I think the ex's actions are not wrong, so the author is not in the wrong because the ex is the one who made the decision without communication. Wait, no, the author is asking if he is in the wrong. If the ex is in the wrong for not discussing with him, then the author is not in the wrong. But if the ex is not in the wrong, then the author is wrong for being upset. But in reality, the ex has the right to come out to her kids, so the author's criticism is unwarranted. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, which would be answer A. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The author's ex came out to the kids without consultation. The author is upset. The ex's actions might be within her rights, so the author's reaction is the issue. If the author is in the wrong for being upset and not respecting the ex's choice, then answer A. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the ex did the right thing, then the author is in the wrong for being upset. So answer A. But if the ex's actions were wrong, then answer B. Considering that coming out is a personal right, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Wait, but the author isn't in the wrong if he's the one who was wronged in the divorce. Hmm. This is really complex. Maybe the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong because the ex should have communicated. But the author is also not in the wrong for being upset. Alternatively, the author's approach is wrong, but the answer is B. I'm confused. Let me check similar scenarios. Usually, in co-parenting, both parents have rights. The ex's decision to come out is her choice, but the author should have been informed. However, the author's reaction might be more about his own issues. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But the ex's actions are not wrong either. The author is not in the wrong for being upset, but the ex is wrong for not communicating. Therefore, the answer is B. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not in the wrong, answer B. Since the ex didn't consult, but her coming out is her right, the author is not in the wrong for being upset, so answer B.\n"
