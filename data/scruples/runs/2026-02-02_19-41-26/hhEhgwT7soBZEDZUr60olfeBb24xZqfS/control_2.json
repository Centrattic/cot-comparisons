Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The author is a parent who had a bad divorce and now they don't get along well, but they try for the kids. The ex didn't date much, but the author has had two girlfriends. The ex came out as gay to the kids and brought her girlfriend around them without discussing it with the other parent. The author is upset because they think it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids. They confronted the ex, but she didn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is upset because the ex didn't consult them. But the ex might believe that her relationship with her girlfriend is her personal life and that she has the right to be honest with the kids. Also, the author's ex might be coming from a place where she wants the kids to know her true self, especially if she's in a relationship. However, not consulting the other parent could be problematic, especially since the kids are involved.\n\nIn co-parenting situations, communication is key. Even if the parents don't get along, important decisions about the kids should be discussed. But the ex's sexuality is a personal matter. The question is whether coming out to the kids falls under co-parenting decisions or her personal life. If the ex is bringing her girlfriend around the kids, that might affect the children's environment, so the author might have a valid concern about how this is handled. However, the author's ex's decision to be truthful about her identity is also important. \n\nThe author is upset about the kids thinking about their past marriage. That might be something they need to address with the kids if necessary, but the ex's sexuality isn't a reflection on the author. The author is in a way projecting their feelings about the marriage onto the situation. \n\nThe ex's response was dismissive, which is not helpful. But the core issue is whether she was wrong to come out to the kids without consulting the author. Legally, unless there's a custody arrangement that requires consultation, the ex might have the right to her personal life. However, ethically, it's good practice to communicate with the co-parent, especially when it affects the children. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but maybe the ex is in the wrong for not discussing it. The author's main issue is the lack of communication, not the fact that the ex is gay. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
