Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their ex had a nasty divorce ten years ago. They don't get along well but co-parent three kids. The ex recently came out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around them without informing the author. The author feels blindsided and upset because they think it's not appropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. They confronted the ex via text, but she responded by saying they shouldn't text during parenting time unless it's about scheduling. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the ex made a significant life decision (coming out to the kids) without consulting the co-parent, the author feels it's inappropriate to discuss such matters with children, and there's a communication breakdown between the two parents.\n\nFrom a co-parenting perspective, it's generally considered important to discuss major decisions with the other parent, especially when it affects the children. Even if they have a strained relationship, co-parenting requires cooperation. The ex bringing a girlfriend around the kids might be a significant change that the author should be informed about, as it could impact the children's adjustment.\n\nHowever, the ex's sexuality is a personal matter. The act of coming out as gay doesn't inherently harm the kids; in fact, being honest about one's identity can be healthy. The issue here is the lack of communication. The ex didn't consult the author, which is a breach of co-parenting norms. But the author is also reacting negatively, thinking the kids might be confused about their own marriage. It's possible the author is projecting their own insecurities or fears onto the situation.\n\nThe author's argument that discussing sexuality with children isn't acceptable might not hold, especially if the ex believes it's important for the kids to know. Children have a right to know their parents' identities, and in this case, the ex is their parent. However, the method of disclosure without the other parent's input is problematic.\n\nThe ex's response to the author's texts seems dismissive and uncooperative. That's not helpful in a co-parenting relationship. The author is seeking clarity and explanation, which is reasonable. The ex's refusal to engage beyond scheduling matters exacerbates the problem.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the ex is wrong for not discussing this with the other parent. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about not being informed. However, the assumption that the author is wrong might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. But generally, in co-parenting, communication is key. So, the author is not in the wrong because the ex should have discussed this with them first. The answer would be B (No).\n"
