Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their ex announced they're gay to the kids without consulting them. The author feels it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children and is upset because they weren't informed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms regarding co-parenting. After a divorce, both parents usually have shared custody, so each has a right to be involved in the children's lives. The ex didn't consult the author, which might be an issue because co-parents are expected to communicate about major decisions affecting the kids.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the children's well-being. Introducing a new partner or discussing one's sexuality can be significant for children. Without prior communication, the author might feel blindsided, which could affect the kids emotionally. The ex's response of not engaging in discussions beyond scheduling seems dismissive and could be seen as not respecting the co-parenting agreement.\n\nHowever, the ex's choice to come out as gay isn't inherently wrong. Sexual orientation is a personal matter, and the ex has the right to live their truth. The problem here is the lack of communication rather than the act of coming out itself. The author might feel betrayed because they weren't included in a decision that affects the children, but the ex's action isn't necessarily illegal or unethical\u2014it's more about the process of communication.\n\nI should also consider if there are any legal obligations. In many places, parents aren't legally required to inform the other parent about their personal life unless it directly impacts the children's welfare. But since the ex is bringing a girlfriend around the kids and discussing her sexuality, it could influence the kids' understanding and environment, so communication is key.\n\nThe author's reaction is valid because co-parents are expected to collaborate. The ex's refusal to engage beyond scheduling is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the lack of communication. The main issue is the ex's unilateral decision without considering the other parent's input.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the ex failed to communicate a significant change that affects the children, which is a co-parenting responsibility.\n"
