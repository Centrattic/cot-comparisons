Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being upset that their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them. The situation involves a complicated divorce, ongoing tension between the ex-spouses, and the ex coming out to their children without prior discussion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have the right to raise their children as they see fit, including discussing their sexuality. However, there might be custody agreements or co-parenting plans that outline how such decisions should be handled. If there's no such agreement, the ex might have the right to share her sexuality with the kids. \n\nNext, the emotional impact on the children. The ex's decision to come out could be important for her own well-being and the children's understanding of their parent. However, the author is concerned about the potential confusion or stigma this might cause the kids. It's important to balance the parent's right to self-expression with the children's best interests.\n\nThe author's reaction is also key. They feel blindsided and are upset about how the ex presented her sexuality (as gay rather than bisexual). This might stem from their own insecurities or fears about their former marriage. The author's approach to confronting the ex via text and demanding an explanation could be seen as aggressive, especially if the ex didn't respond. \n\nAnother angle is the communication between the exes. The author claims the ex ignored their communications, which might indicate a pattern of poor co-parenting. However, the ex's initial response about not texting during parenting time could be about maintaining boundaries. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, sharing one's sexuality with children is becoming more accepted, but the method and timing matter. The ex might have had her reasons for choosing this moment, but the lack of prior discussion with the other parent is a point of contention. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's main issue is the lack of consultation and the potential impact on the kids. However, the ex has her own rights as a parent. The key question is whether the author overstepped by demanding an explanation and considering it a betrayal. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction might be more about their own feelings of betrayal and confusion rather than the act of coming out itself. The ex's decision, while not discussed in advance, might be within her rights as a parent. The author's approach to communication could be seen as aggressive, contributing to the conflict. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of the act itself but could be in the way they handled the situation.\n"
