Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex-spouse coming out as gay to the kids without discussing it with the other parent first.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The ex and author split ten years ago, had a bad divorce. They have three kids and don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex has a girlfriend now and told the kids she's gay, not bisexual, and started bringing the girlfriend around. The author feels blindsided, thinks the ex shouldn't have discussed sexuality with the kids, and is upset about it. The ex didn't respond to the author's texts.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a 'Yes' or 'No' answer based on the situation. Let me break it down.\n\nIn many places, both parents have the right to be involved in their children's lives post-divorce, especially regarding major life decisions. However, coming out as a parent is a personal decision. The ex's choice to come out to the kids is her right, but the method might be questionable. Did she have a responsibility to discuss it with the author first? Well, if they have joint custody and are supposed to co-parent, maybe she should have communicated. But the author is asking if he's in the wrong, so maybe he's arguing that she should have discussed it with him first.\n\nHowever, the ex's sexuality is her personal matter. She has the right to be herself and her partner in front of the kids. The author's problem isn't with her being gay but with not informing him first. The kids might need to know their parent's sexuality for various reasons, like understanding their mom's life. But the author is upset because he didn't see it coming and is worried about how the kids perceive him and their marriage.\n\nThe ex didn't answer his texts, which complicates things. The author is upset about the lack of communication. But is he in the wrong? If the ex has the right to make her own decisions, even if the author didn't agree, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe the ex should have discussed it, especially if there's a co-parenting agreement.\n\nWait, but in co-parenting, major decisions about the child's upbringing usually require mutual agreement. However, the parent's personal life might not fall under that. Unless the author is the custodial parent, but the scenario says they split ten years ago and both are trying for the kids. So maybe they have joint custody. The ex's decision to bring a partner around the kids might be something that needs discussion, but coming out to the kids is her personal choice.\n\nSo, the author's issue is not with the ex being gay but with not consulting him. But is that the ex's responsibility? If the ex is the parent, she has the right to make decisions about her own life as long as it's in the child's best interest. But bringing a new partner into the kids' lives might be a co-parenting issue. However, the act of coming out to the kids is different. She has the right to express her identity. The author's problem is more about the method and lack of communication. However, the ex's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for being upset about the lack of communication. But the ex isn't wrong for making a personal decision. The key here is whether the ex should have discussed it. If co-parenting requires mutual discussion on matters affecting the children, then the ex might be at fault. But if it's a personal matter, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, the author's argument that discussing sexuality with kids is not acceptable might be problematic. It's important for kids to know their parent's sexuality if it's relevant to their lives. So maybe the author is in the wrong for opposing it?\n\nWait, the author says he doesn't think it's acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children. That's a problematic view. Parents should be honest about their identities, especially if it's part of their life the kids are going to encounter. So maybe the author is wrong in thinking it's not acceptable. Additionally, the ex's sexuality doesn't reflect on the author's past marriage; it's her own identity. The author is projecting his own insecurities perhaps.\n\nThe ex's actions might be correct in coming out to the kids as her own choice, and the author's problem is about not being consulted. But if they have joint custody and co-parenting responsibilities, the ex should have discussed it. However, some personal decisions don't require consultation. The line here is blurry. The author is upset, but is he in the wrong? If the ex has the right to be herself around her children, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset but the ex isn't wrong for doing it. However, the author's assertion that it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children is incorrect. Therefore, the author's stance is problematic, making him at least partially at fault for his own reaction.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, no. If the author is wrong in thinking it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children, then his perspective is flawed. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for the situation. The ex did something that the author didn't agree with, and the author is upset. The ex should have communicated better, but the author's stance on discussing sexuality might be wrong. However, the question is about being in the wrong in the situation. The author isn't wrong for being upset, but perhaps the ex is wrong for not discussing. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's main arguments are the ex not consulting him and the ex's decision to come out to the kids. If the author isn't wrong for being upset about the lack of communication, but the ex is wrong for not discussing, then the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, if the author is wrong in thinking it's not acceptable to discuss sexuality with kids, then he's in the wrong. But that's more about his beliefs than the situation. The question is about the situation, so the answer is B.\n"
