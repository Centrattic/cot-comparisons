Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about an ex-spouse coming out as gay to the kids without consulting the other parent. The author thinks the ex did something wrong by not discussing it first and is upset about how the kids might perceive the author and their past marriage. The author also mentions that the ex didn't consult them and now brings her girlfriend around the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have joint custody, so major decisions about the kids' lives usually require mutual agreement. However, a parent's sexual orientation might not be considered a \"major decision\" in the same way as schooling or medical care. But the way it's presented could affect the kids' well-being. The author is upset that the ex came out as gay instead of bisexual, implying a possible accusation that the author's past behavior might be misunderstood. That could be a sensitive issue for the kids.\n\nThe ex didn't consult the author, which is a point of contention. However, coming out to one's children is a personal decision. While it's good to communicate with co-parents, it's not necessarily the other parent's right to approve of such personal disclosures. The ex might feel that it's her decision to make, especially since the kids are her children too. The author's reaction seems to stem from a desire to control the narrative about their past and prevent potential stigma or confusion for the kids.\n\nBut then, the author is asking if they are in the wrong. The key questions are: Did the ex overstep by not discussing it first? Does the author have a right to be involved in such a personal revelation about the ex's identity? The ex might have a right to live her life and be authentic, even post-divorce, especially if the kids are part of her life. However, the manner in which she presented her identity could impact the kids, so some communication might be necessary.\n\nThe author's approach of confronting via text and demanding an explanation might not be the best method for co-parenting. The ex's response was to limit communication to scheduling, which is common in tense co-parenting situations. But the author's demand for an explanation could come off as dismissive of the ex's right to privacy or autonomy.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author is upset about the lack of consultation, but perhaps the ex had the right to make that decision. The author's focus on the kids' perception of them and the past marriage might be more about the author's own insecurities or fears rather than the kids' well-being. The ex's decision to come out as gay isn't inherently harmful, but the lack of discussion before doing so might have been a misstep. However, the author's reaction, including demanding explanations and potentially causing conflict, might not be appropriate either.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the answer might depend on cultural norms, parenting styles, and the specific dynamics of their co-parenting. If the ex had a right to come out to her children without the other parent's approval, then the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her right to live authentically. However, if the ex's approach was abrupt and unconsidered for the kids' emotional state, then the ex might be at fault. The author's insistence on controlling the narrative about their marriage could also be problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is not entirely in the wrong, but neither is the ex. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex's action (coming out) is a personal right, and the author's overreaction to protect their own image might be inappropriate, perhaps the ex is more in the right. But the author's concern for the kids' well-being isn't invalid. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the ex had to consider the kids' needs, but the author's approach could be improved. Hmm. Alternatively, if the ex should have discussed it with the other parent, then the ex is in the wrong. But coming out is a personal matter. I'm leaning towards B (author not in the wrong) but not entirely sure. Wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but perhaps the author is justified in wanting to have a say in how their ex presents herself to the kids. However, legally, the ex can make her own decisions about her identity. So maybe the author is in the right to be upset but not entirely in the wrong. This is complicated. I'll go with B, the author is not in the wrong because the ex should have considered communication, but the author's reaction is also problematic. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex made a unilateral decision that affects the kids, the author might have a right to be upset. Therefore, answer B.\n"
