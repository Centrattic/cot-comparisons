Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex told their kids she's gay after a messy divorce, without consulting the author. The author feels it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids and is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex came out to the children without discussing it with the author. The author is upset because they think it's inappropriate for a parent to talk about their sexuality to kids. The ex is bringing her girlfriend around the kids now. The author tried to get an explanation but the ex didn't respond.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) The ex came out to the kids without the author's input, 2) The author thinks it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children, 3) The ex is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids, and 4) The author is seeking validation on whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, both parents usually have rights to make decisions about their children's upbringing unless there's a court order. But this is more about personal feelings and co-parenting. The ex's actions could be seen as overstepping if there's no agreement on how to handle such matters. However, coming out is a personal aspect of identity. The ex might feel it's important for the kids to know her truth, especially if she's in a relationship now.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with kids. But children might have questions, and the parent might believe it's important for them to understand their parent's identity. The author might be projecting his own concerns about the kids' perception of him and their marriage. The ex's refusal to engage in the conversation could be seen as dismissive of the author's concerns, but maybe she felt it was necessary for the kids to know regardless.\n\nI need to consider the co-parenting dynamic. If the ex has custody during her parenting time, she might believe she can make decisions during that time without the other parent's input. But major decisions, like revealing such personal information, could require communication between co-parents. The lack of communication is a red flag here. The ex didn't even respond to the author's follow-up, which is uncooperative.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's not at fault because the ex acted without consulting him. However, the author's initial statement about the divorce being his fault and the ex not dating much while he had two girlfriends might suggest some bias. But the main issue is about the kids' well-being and appropriate communication between co-parents.\n\nIn terms of ethics, parents have a duty to communicate with each other about their children's lives. The ex's decision to come out without discussion might be seen as a breach of co-parenting cooperation. However, the ex's sexuality is part of her identity, and she might feel it's important for the kids to know, especially if she's in a relationship. The key here is whether the ex considered the author's perspective and whether the author's objection is valid.\n\nThe author's stance that it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children is problematic. It's important for children to know their parent's identity, and withholding that information could be harmful. However, the method of disclosure is important. The ex should have discussed this with the co-parent to ensure the children are supported properly.\n\nIn conclusion, the ex's failure to communicate is a mistake, but the author's belief that discussing sexuality with children is inappropriate might be misguided. The author's main concern is about his image and the kids' perception, which might not be the primary issue. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset about the lack of communication, but the ex is at fault for not discussing it. However, the author's perspective on the appropriateness of discussing sexuality might need reevaluation.\n"
