Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-spouse who told the kids she's gay without consulting the other parent. The author is upset because they feel this was done without their input, and they're worried about the kids' understanding of the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall if there are any laws or social norms about parents discussing their sexuality with their children. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their own children's upbringing, but when it comes to co-parents, communication is key. Since they're both parents, even after a divorce, they should ideally communicate about major decisions affecting the kids.\n\nThe ex decided to tell the kids she's gay and started bringing her girlfriend around. The author wasn't consulted. The question is who's in the wrong here. The author is upset because they feel blindsided and worried about how the kids perceive them and the previous marriage. The ex didn't consult, which could be seen as a breach of co-parenting responsibility. But the author also has a history of a nasty divorce and maybe hasn't been the ideal parent (they admit they fucked up), but that might not directly relate here.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Or is the ex in the wrong for not discussing with the other parent? Typically, co-parenting requires cooperation. The ex might have a right to their own identity, but informing the children about such a personal matter should involve the other parent, especially since the kids are part of both parents' lives. However, if the ex feels it's necessary for the kids to know, maybe there's a middle ground. But the key point is the lack of communication. The author isn't wrong for wanting to discuss this with the ex. The ex's response was dismissive, not addressing the issue.\n\nSo, the author's reaction is understandable. They're not in the wrong for wanting to be involved in decisions affecting their children. The ex should have communicated. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Like, maybe the ex has the right to come out without consulting? But when it directly affects the kids and their relationship with both parents, communication is important. So the answer is B.\n"
