Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation involves an ex-spouse telling their kids she's gay without consulting the other parent. The kids are now being exposed to this information, and the ex is bringing a girlfriend around them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, both parents have rights regarding their children's upbringing. However, if the parents are divorced, each might have their own parenting time. The ex might be within her rights to share her own identity with the kids during her time with them. But there's a question of how to handle it sensitively, especially since the kids were already aware of the parent's previous relationship with the author. \n\nThe author is upset because the ex didn't consult him, which could affect how the children perceive the situation. But the ex's identity is her own, and she might feel the need to be authentic in front of her children. However, bringing a girlfriend into their lives without the other parent's input could be seen as not considering the other parent's role. \n\nThe key points are: the ex didn't communicate this change, which might have caused confusion for the kids, and the author feels blindsided. The ex's response was dismissive, not engaging in dialogue. Legally, the ex might have the right to live her life, but ethically, communication between co-parents is important for the children's well-being. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset, as co-parents should ideally discuss significant life changes that affect the children. The ex's actions could be seen as not respecting the co-parent's role, especially if the kids were previously told the parent was straight. The author's frustration is valid, so the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
