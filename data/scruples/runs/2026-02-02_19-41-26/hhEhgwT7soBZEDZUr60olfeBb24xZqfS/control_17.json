Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the ex) is in the wrong for telling their kids she's gay without consulting the other ex. The situation is that they have three kids, a nasty divorce, and the ex hasn't dated much while the author has had two long-term relationships. The ex came out as gay to the kids and brought her girlfriend around them without discussing it with the author first. The author is upset because the ex didn't ask how they felt and is worried about the kids' perception of them and their marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of co-parenting. In many places, parents are encouraged to make decisions about their children's upbringing together. However, this is about the ex's personal identity and her relationship, which might not directly affect the children's upbringing. The ex is likely within her rights to live her life and share her identity with her children, especially since she's their parent.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel blindsided and the ex didn't consult them. But the ex is their parent, so she has the right to be open with her children. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the kids, worrying about what the children think of them. However, the kids need to know the truth about their parent, and the ex's sexuality is a personal aspect of her life that she might choose to share when she's ready.\n\nThe ex's response to the author's texts is dismissive, which is a separate issue. The author's approach of confronting her via text might not be the best way to handle it. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about the ex coming out to the kids. The ex didn't do anything illegal, but the author might feel wronged because of the lack of communication. However, the ex's decision to come out to her children is a personal one, and the author's reaction might stem from their own unresolved issues from the divorce rather than the children's best interest.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). Wait, but maybe the author is in the wrong because the ex has the right to be open with her children. The author's issue is more about feeling excluded from a decision that's actually the ex's to make. The kids have a right to know their mother, and the ex's sexuality is part of that identity. The author's anger might be misplaced. Therefore, the answer is B: No, the author is not in the wrong. Wait, no, actually, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the ex's autonomy. Hmm. This is tricky. The ex is their parent, so she can decide to be open with her kids. The author's problem is with the lack of communication, but the ex doesn't owe the author an explanation. So the author's issue is with the ex's lack of communication, but the act of coming out to the kids isn't wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but the ex's action isn't wrong either. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would be B (No) because the author isn't wrong for being upset, but the ex isn't wrong for coming out. The author's main issue is the lack of communication, which is a co-parenting problem. So the answer is B.\n"
