Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-spouse coming out as gay to the kids without consulting the other parent. The author is upset and thinks the ex shouldn't have done that without discussing it first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex is a parent, so their relationship with the kids is important. The author mentions that they don't get along well but try for the kids' sake. The ex introduced her girlfriend to the kids without talking to the author first. The author feels blindsided and is concerned about the kids' perception of him and their marriage.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer could go either way. Let's think about the legal and social aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to be involved in major decisions regarding their children. However, when it comes to a parent's personal identity, like coming out as gay or bisexual, it's a bit different. The parent has the right to live their life, but how they communicate that to the children might depend on the children's age and maturity.\n\nThe ex didn't consult the author, which the author finds problematic. However, the ex is the parent, so she might have a right to make decisions about her own family life, especially if the children are old enough to understand. The author's main issue seems to be the lack of communication and the potential impact on the kids' perception of him. But if the ex is comfortable with her identity, she might feel it's important to be open with the children.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction might be influenced by their previous relationship. Since the divorce was nasty and long, there's existing tension. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or fears onto the situation. The ex's response was dismissive, which could indicate that the communication between them is strained.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, both parents have equal rights to make decisions about their children unless a court order specifies otherwise. However, when it comes to personal matters like the parent's sexuality, it's more about how the parent chooses to present themselves. The key here is whether the ex's actions directly affect the children's well-being. If the ex is bringing her girlfriend around the kids, it's part of her personal life and possibly modeling healthy relationships, which is important.\n\nBut the author might feel that the ex's decision to label herself as gay instead of bisexual could affect the kids' perception of the author's masculinity or the previous marriage. This seems more about the author's own feelings rather than the kids' actual understanding. However, if the kids are confused or if the author is worried about their mental health, that's a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the ex might have a duty to consider the co-parent's feelings, especially if the kids are young. However, the children's right to know their parent's identity is also important. The author's approach of confronting via text and demanding an explanation might not be the best way to handle it, especially if it's during parenting time.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the ex decided to come out to the kids as part of her identity, she has a right to do so. However, not discussing it with the co-parent first could be seen as a breach of the co-parenting agreement, especially if there's a history of conflict. But if there's no formal agreement, the ex might not be obligated to get permission. The author's reaction might stem from personal insecurities rather than the kids' best interests.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they have a right to be informed about significant changes that could affect their co-parenting relationship. However, the ex also has the right to her own identity. The main issue is the lack of communication, which both parties could have handled better. But based on the information given, the author's concern is valid, so the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
