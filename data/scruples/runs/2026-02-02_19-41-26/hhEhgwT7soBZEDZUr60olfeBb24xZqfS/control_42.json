Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is at fault for being upset that their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The situation involves a divorce ten years ago, a contentious split, and the ex not dating much since, while the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex came out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around, without discussing it with the author first. The author is upset because they feel blindsided and concerned about how the kids perceive them and their past marriage. They tried to communicate via text but the ex only responded about scheduling, ignoring their requests for an explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many jurisdictions, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. However, if there's a shared custody arrangement, both parents are expected to communicate and make major decisions jointly. The ex's decision to discuss her sexuality with the kids might be seen as a significant life event affecting the children, so not consulting the other parent could be problematic, especially if there's a history of conflict.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author is worried about the kids' perception of their previous marriage and their own identity. The ex's choice to label herself as gay instead of bisexual might be adding to the confusion. The author's reaction is to confront the ex, but the ex isn't engaging beyond scheduling, which could indicate she doesn't see it as a joint decision.\n\nI should also think about the age of the kids. The question doesn't specify their ages, but being 10 years post-divorce, if they were teenagers at the time, they might now be young adults. If they were younger, the ex's approach might need to be more age-appropriate. However, the author's issue is more about the lack of communication rather than the content itself.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the ex's action of not discussing it with the other parent could be seen as a breach of mutual parental responsibility. However, the ex also has her own identity and the right to be open about it. The author's anger stems from feeling blindsided and the potential impact on the kids, which is understandable. But is it the author's place to have a say in the ex's personal life, even concerning the children?\n\nThe key here is whether the ex had a responsibility to consult the author. In a shared custody situation, major decisions that affect the children's understanding of family dynamics should be discussed. The author isn't objecting to the ex being gay but to the manner and timing of disclosure. The ex not involving the author could be wrong, making her at fault. However, the author's reaction of demanding an explanation through texts and calls without a clear resolution might be seen as confrontational, which isn't productive.\n\nIn conclusion, the ex may have a right to her identity, but the unilateral decision without communication could be at fault. The author's distress is valid, but their approach might not be the best. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the ex was wrong to not consult, making the author not at fault. The answer would lean towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the ex's actions lacked communication and consideration, but there's nuance depending on legal and cultural contexts.\n"
