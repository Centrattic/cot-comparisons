Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong in the situation with their ex-partner telling their kids that she's gay. The author feels that their ex didn't consult them and just dropped that information without discussion. The key points here are about communication between co-parents, the appropriateness of discussing sexual orientation with children, and the potential impact on the kids.\n\nFirst, the ex and the author have a history of a contentious divorce. That's probably affecting their current interactions. The author mentions that the ex didn't consult them about coming out to the kids. This is a big deal because co-parents usually need to coordinate important decisions, especially those that might affect the children's understanding of family dynamics. If the ex decided unilaterally, that could be a problem in terms of co-parenting responsibilities.\n\nHowever, the author's argument is that they don't think it's appropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids. But wait, isn't a parent's sexual orientation a personal aspect of their identity? If the ex is in a relationship, the kids might naturally notice her bringing someone around. Choosing to be open about her sexuality might be part of being honest with the children. But the age of the kids and the way it was handled matter. If the kids are old enough, discussing such topics could be necessary for their understanding, but if they're younger, it might be more complex.\n\nThe author's main issue is not the ex coming out per se, but not consulting them. The ex's response was dismissive, indicating a lack of cooperation. In co-parenting scenarios, communication is key. Even if the author disagrees with the approach, the ex should have discussed it to avoid conflict. However, the author's stance on discussing sexuality with kids might be based on personal beliefs, but that's their own perspective. The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling that way.\n\nBut the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The ex made a decision without consulting the other parent, which is a breach in co-parenting norms. Even if the author doesn't agree with the content of the disclosure, the lack of communication is problematic. On the other hand, the ex has a right to her own identity and relationships, which the kids might naturally become aware of. But handling it without discussion could be seen as not respecting the co-parent's input.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that the ex didn't communicate. The ex is at fault for not discussing the matter. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
