Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the ex-spouse telling the kids she's gay without discussing it with the other parent first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to be involved in major decisions affecting their children, especially after a divorce. The ex didn't consult the author, which could be problematic. But the author also has a history of a nasty divorce, which might have led to ongoing tension that's affecting co-parenting.\n\nThe ex's action of coming out to the kids isn't inherently wrong, but the way she did it\u2014without communication\u2014could be an issue. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if the kids are interpreting the situation as the author being at fault for the marriage ending. However, the author's approach of confronting via text and demanding an explanation might not be the best co-parenting strategy. \n\nI should also consider if coming out to children is a parent's right. Parents often share personal information with their kids, but the timing and method matter. The key here is communication between co-parents. The ex didn't reach out, so the author's reaction is a response to a lack of collaboration.\n\nThe author might be overstepping by expecting to have a say in the ex's personal life, but since they are co-parents, it's reasonable to discuss matters that affect the children. The ex's refusal to engage beyond scheduling is also concerning because it shows a lack of willingness to address the author's concerns.\n\nIn terms of the kids, their well-being is the priority. The author is worried about how the kids perceive them and their marriage. However, the ex's decision to be open about her sexuality could be positive for the kids if handled well. The main issue is the lack of communication between the parents.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for being upset about the lack of consultation, but their method of confrontation could be improved. The ex is also in the wrong for not discussing the matter. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, which I think they aren't. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
