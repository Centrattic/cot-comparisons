Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the ex-partner coming out as gay to the kids without consulting the author. The author is upset because this wasn't discussed, and they feel it's not appropriate for a parent to discuss sexuality with children. The ex didn't respond to the author's attempts to communicate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex and author are co-parents. They have a contentious history, but try for the kids' sake. The ex introduced her girlfriend to the kids without prior discussion. The author is upset about the lack of consultation and the potential impact on the kids. The ex's response was dismissive, focusing only on scheduling during parenting time.\n\nNow, thinking about parental rights and responsibilities. Both parents have the right to raise their children, but they should ideally communicate and collaborate. However, when there's a history of conflict, it's more complex. The ex's decision to come out to the kids might be a personal choice, but involving the kids in such a way without discussing with the co-parent could be problematic. However, the author's own past mistakes (mentioning they \"fucked up\" leading to a nasty divorce) might affect their credibility here. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not allowing the ex to express her sexuality? Or is the ex in the wrong for not discussing it? The author might feel blindsided, but the ex has the right to her identity. However, the way she presented it to the kids could influence the author's reaction. The author's assertion that it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children is a key point. Some might argue that parents can share such information if they believe it's appropriate and in the kids' best interest, especially if they're in a stable relationship. However, the lack of consultation is a red flag. Co-parenting typically requires cooperation, even if there's animosity.\n\nThe ex's dismissive response might indicate she felt it was her right to handle it as she saw fit. But the author has a valid concern about the kids' understanding and the potential confusion, especially given the past marriage. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or fears onto the children. \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, unless there's a court order specifying such discussions, both parents have a right to their own lives, but they must act in the best interest of the children. The main issue here is communication. The ex didn't communicate, leading to conflict. However, the author's own past actions might have contributed to the strained relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author is upset about the lack of communication, which is valid. However, the ex has the right to her identity. But the method of disclosure without discussion could be seen as negligent. It's a tough call. The author's reaction is based on their feelings of betrayal and concern for the kids, but the ex's action is about her own life choices. The answer might depend on whether the disclosure was done in a way that's age-appropriate and if the ex considered the co-parent's perspective. \n\nIn many co-parenting scenarios, even if there's disagreement, the focus should be on the children's well-being. The author might be projecting their own issues onto the situation. The ex's actions could be her way of moving on, but not discussing it with the author is problematic. However, the author's own past mistakes in the marriage might affect their ability to co-parent effectively. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the lack of communication. The ex made a unilateral decision that affects both parents' relationship with the kids. However, the author might need to consider the ex's right to her identity. But the main issue is the lack of communication. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), as the ex's failure to discuss the matter with the co-parent is the primary issue here.\n"
