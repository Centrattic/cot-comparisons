She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them. The situation is that the author and ex got divorced ten years ago after a messy split. They don't get along well, but they try for the kids. The ex hasn't dated much, but the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex decided to come out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around, without talking to the author first. The author thinks the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids and is upset about it. They confronted the ex, who only responded about scheduling during parenting time. The author is asking if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are: the ex shared her sexuality with the kids without consulting the author, the author is upset, and the ex isn't responding to their concerns. The author is questioning their own actions, thinking maybe they're in the wrong, but they also think the ex is wrong for doing this.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the ex shouldn't have told the kids about her sexuality without discussing it with them first. They also mention the kids might be confused about their past marriage. However, the ex's sexuality is her personal matter. Parents often have to communicate their identity to children, especially if it's relevant to their family dynamics. The author's previous actions (like cheating, leading to a nasty divorce) might have contributed to the lack of trust. The author's anger could stem from feeling blindsided, but the ex has a right to her identity. On the other hand, the author might have a right to be informed, especially if it affects how the kids perceive the family. However, the ex's decision to come out as gay is a personal choice and not something that requires the ex-spouse's approval. The author's reaction\u2014demanding an explanation via text\u2014might not be the most constructive approach. The ex's refusal to engage beyond scheduling could indicate a pattern of poor communication from the divorce. \n\nConsidering the ethics here, the ex's action isn't inherently wrong. She has a right to her identity, and sharing it with the children is part of being an honest parent. The author's reaction, while understandable due to the messy divorce, might be overreaching. The author's focus on controlling the narrative around their own marriage might be misplaced. The kids' well-being is important, and the ex's approach could help them understand family dynamics better. The author's lack of cooperation in the co-parenting aspect (given the divorce history) might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong, but the ex's actions are also not necessarily wrong. The author's concern about being blindsided is valid, but the ex's decision to come out to the kids is her right. The author's handling of the situation (confronting via text, demanding explanations) might not be the best approach, but the core issue is the ex's unilateral decision. However, the author isn't in the wrong; rather, the ex might be responsible for not considering the co-parenting dynamic. The key is that the ex should have communicated better, but the author isn't wrong for feeling upset. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is upset about the ex making a personal choice without consulting them, but the ex's choice is her own, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, the author's approach to handling the situation might be problematic. But the question isn't about the best approach; it's about right or wrong. The author's anger is valid, but the ex's action is her right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the ex's action is not wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
