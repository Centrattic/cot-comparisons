Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-spouse who, without discussing it with their co-parent, told their kids that she's gay and started bringing her girlfriend around them. The author is upset because they feel blindsided and worry about how the kids perceive them and the past marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of co-parenting. In many places, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, but when there's a divorce, it's usually about shared custody and joint decision-making. If the ex didn't consult the other parent, that could be an issue. However, a parent's sexual orientation is a personal matter, and coming out to children is something that might be done for the parent's own well-being or the children's understanding.\n\nThe author mentions that the ex didn't ask their opinion, so there's a problem with communication. But is it the author's right to have input on their ex's personal identity? The ex's decision to come out to the kids is her choice, especially if it's part of her life they want to share. However, the method of disclosure without consulting the co-parent might not be the best approach, as it could affect the children's relationship with both parents.\n\nAlso, the author is concerned about the children's perspective. If the kids are confused about their parent's sexuality and the previous marriage, that could cause emotional distress. But it's important to consider the children's age and maturity level. The author should ideally communicate with the ex to address any concerns about how the information is presented to the kids.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014confronting via text and not receiving a response\u2014may not be the most effective way to handle the situation. The ex's response about not texting during parenting time suggests a breakdown in communication. However, the author is within their rights to express concern about co-parenting decisions that affect the children.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the key points are: the ex made a significant life decision without consulting the co-parent, which could impact the children. The author is upset about being excluded from that decision. But the ex's right to live her life and share her identity with her children is also important. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but perhaps the ex should have discussed it first. However, if the ex is using her parenting time to be with her girlfriend, the author might need to adjust their approach rather than focusing on the disclosure itself.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the ex's disclosure is considered a necessary part of her identity that should be shared with the children, regardless of the co-parent's opinion. If the author doesn't have a legal right to be consulted on such matters, then the ex isn't in the wrong. But if co-parenting agreements require mutual decision-making, then the ex might be at fault. But since the ex is using her own parenting time, she might have the right to share her life with the kids as she sees fit. Therefore, the author's reaction might stem from feeling blindsided, but the ex's action could be her right. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but the ex's approach might be questionable. However, the main issue is the lack of communication. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because the ex didn't consult, but there's nuance. Alternatively, A if the author should accept the ex's decision without input. Given the user's own thought that the author might be in the wrong, but considering the ex's right to her identity, the answer might be B.\n"
