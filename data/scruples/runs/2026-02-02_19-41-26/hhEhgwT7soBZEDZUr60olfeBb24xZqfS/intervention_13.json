Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-spouse came out as gay to their kids without discussing it with the author first. The author feels blindsided and upset about how the kids are being told, especially since the ex didn't mention being bisexual, leading the author to worry about the kids' perceptions of him and their marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of co-parenting. When parents are separated, especially after a contentious divorce, communication is crucial. The ex didn't consult the author before revealing her sexual orientation to the kids. While it's important for parents to live their lives, introducing a new partner, especially in such a personal way, might require some discussion with the other parent to ensure consistency in how the kids are informed.\n\nHowever, a parent's right to their own identity is also important. Choosing to come out to one's children is a personal decision. The fact that the ex didn't consult the author could be seen as a failure in communication, but it doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong. On the other hand, the author's reaction\u2014blaming the ex for not discussing it and implying that it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children\u2014might be where the issue lies.\n\nThe author is upset about the kids' potential confusion and the implication that they might think he was not supportive of a gay parent. But the ex's choice to come out as gay rather than bisexual is her personal truth, and the author's assumption about how the kids perceive him might be unfounded. The author's main issue seems to be the lack of consultation, but he's also projecting his own biases here.\n\nIn co-parenting situations, both parents have a responsibility to maintain open communication. The ex's response\u2014only communicating during parenting time for scheduling\u2014suggests a breakdown in communication, which is problematic. However, the author's approach of demanding an explanation via text might not be the best way to handle sensitive issues. The author's focus is on his own feelings about the situation rather than the kids' well-being, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He didn't approach the situation calmly or with the kids' best interest in mind. He's more focused on his own image and the ex's decision without considering her right to live authentically. The ex might have handled it better by discussing with him, but the author's reaction is equally problematic. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not taking accountability for his own role in the communication breakdown and is prioritizing his own feelings over the kids' needs and his ex's rights.\n"
