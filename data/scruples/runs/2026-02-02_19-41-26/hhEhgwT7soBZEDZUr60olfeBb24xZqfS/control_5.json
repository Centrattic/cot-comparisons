She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the key points: The ex and the author split ten years ago, a messy divorce. They have three kids, and they don't get along well but try for the kids' sake. The ex didn't date much after the split, while the author had two long-term girlfriends. The ex told the kids she's gay and brought her girlfriend around them without discussing it with the author. The author feels this is inappropriate and is upset because the ex didn't consult them. The ex responded by ignoring the author's texts about it, only talking about scheduling during parenting time.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The question is whether the ex overstepped by disclosing her sexual orientation to the kids without consulting the other parent. Let's consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to be involved in major decisions regarding their children, including aspects of the child's upbringing. However, when it comes to a parent's own identity, like sexual orientation, the situation is different. The ex might feel it's her right to be authentic and share her identity with the kids, especially if they're teenagers or older and capable of understanding.\n\nBut the author is upset because they believe the ex should have discussed it with them first. The ex didn't, which led to conflict. The author's argument is that major family decisions should be mutual, but here, the ex is sharing her personal identity, which is her own matter. However, introducing a new partner (girlfriend) to the kids might be a different issue, as it involves the kids' adjustment.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, each parent has the right to make decisions about their own household and personal relationships, unless there are specific custody arrangements that outline otherwise. If the ex is the custodial parent, she might have more autonomy. However, if they have joint custody, both parents might have a say. Since the author mentions they don't get along, it's possible they have joint custody but with shared parenting time. The ex is using her parenting time to introduce her partner, which the author might not agree with.\n\nEthically, the ex might feel her identity is important to share with her children, especially if they're old enough. The author's reaction might stem from discomfort, especially since they were married, and the ex is now in a same-sex relationship. The author's concern about how the kids perceive their past marriage is valid, but perhaps the ex's right to self-identify and share her life with her children is equally important.\n\nThe ex's refusal to discuss it further could be seen as dismissive, especially since the author is trying to communicate. However, if they have an agreement that only scheduling matters during parenting time, the ex might be sticking to that.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and wanting to discuss it. However, the ex isn't necessarily in the wrong for sharing her identity. The key issue is whether the ex should have considered the author's feelings. Since both parents are involved in the kids' lives, communication is crucial. The ex might have assumed it was her right to share, but the lack of communication is problematic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's main issue is the ex's lack of consultation. The author isn't at fault for wanting to discuss it, but the ex might be at fault for not considering the other parent's perspective. However, the ex's decision to live authentically is her right. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The ex's actions are her choice, but the lack of communication is an issue. The author's reaction is understandable, but the ex's decision isn't inherently wrong. Hence, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the ex's approach is questionable.\n"
