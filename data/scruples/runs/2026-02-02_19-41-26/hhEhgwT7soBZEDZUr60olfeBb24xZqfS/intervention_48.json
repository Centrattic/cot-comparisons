Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The ex and author divorced ten years ago, and the relationship was already strained. The ex is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids and didn't communicate with the author about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing unless a court has specified otherwise. So if the ex is the custodial parent, she might have the right to discuss her sexuality with the kids. However, the author might feel blindsided, especially if the kids were previously unaware of her orientation.\n\nThe author's main concerns are about how the kids are perceiving them and the lack of communication. The ex's response was dismissive, telling the author not to text unless it's about scheduling. This could indicate that the ex isn't engaging in proper co-parenting communication.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author is upset because the ex didn't consult him, but the ex might believe she has the right to be open about her identity with the children. On the other hand, the author's approach was to confront via text, which might not be the most effective method. The ex's refusal to engage further could be problematic, as co-parents should ideally discuss matters affecting the kids.\n\nFrom a co-parenting perspective, communication is key. If the ex didn't reach out, that's a missed opportunity to collaborate. However, the author's demand for an explanation might come off as confrontational rather than collaborative. The key issue is whether the ex's actions were appropriate in the context of co-parenting. While honesty is important, the method and timing of disclosure matter, especially if it affects the children's perception of the other parent.\n\nThe author's anger about the kids thinking he's something he's not (since the ex said she's gay instead of bisexual) might be misplaced, as it's not the author's sexuality at issue. The ex's decision to not consult could be a breach of co-parenting responsibilities, but the author's approach might not be fostering a constructive dialogue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The ex should have communicated, but the author's reaction might not be entirely justified, especially if they had a history of conflict. However, the act of not discussing such a significant change in the children's environment without the other parent's input is problematic. Therefore, both parties have some fault, but the primary issue is the lack of communication from the ex. The author's frustration is understandable, but their approach might not be the best. In terms of who is more in the wrong, the ex's failure to communicate is a bigger issue here. However, the author's response could have been more diplomatic. Considering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but the ex's actions are problematic. However, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex didn't communicate, but the author's reaction is a result of that, the answer might be B.\n"
