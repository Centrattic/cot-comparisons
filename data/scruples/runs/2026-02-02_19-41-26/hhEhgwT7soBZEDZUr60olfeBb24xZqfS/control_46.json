Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for being upset that their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and ex are divorced, had a bad split, and don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term relationships. The ex came out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around without talking to the author first. The author is upset because the ex didn't consult them and is worried about what the kids might think about their previous marriage and the author's role as a parent. The ex didn't respond to the author's texts except to say not to contact her during parenting time unless it's scheduling.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nThe ex made a significant life decision\u2014coming out to the kids\u2014and didn't consult the co-parent. The author feels blindsided and is concerned about the impact on the children. The ex's response was dismissive, which might indicate she doesn't see the issue the author does.\n\nIn co-parenting situations, communication is usually important, especially when it comes to major decisions affecting the children. Coming out as part of one's identity is a personal matter, but since they have children, the ex might have a responsibility to consider how this affects the kids and the other parent. However, the ex is also entitled to her identity and the right to be honest with her children. But maybe she should have discussed it with the co-parent first.\n\nThe author's issue is that the ex didn't consult them. The ex's actions might be seen as overstepping by not involving the other parent. The author's reaction is about wanting to be involved in such a decision, which is reasonable. The ex's response of not texting during parenting time except for scheduling is also making it hard for the author to get an explanation.\n\nThe author isn't being judgmental about the ex's sexuality but is upset about the lack of communication and the potential confusion for the kids. The ex's choice to label herself as gay instead of bisexual might be a red herring here; the main issue is the communication breakdown.\n\nIn terms of co-parenting ethics, the ex should have considered the author's feelings and the children's well-being by discussing this. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about not being consulted. The ex's decision to come out is her right, but the method (without communication) might be problematic.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). The ex made a unilateral decision that affects the co-parent and the children, which is why the author is justified in their feelings.\n"
