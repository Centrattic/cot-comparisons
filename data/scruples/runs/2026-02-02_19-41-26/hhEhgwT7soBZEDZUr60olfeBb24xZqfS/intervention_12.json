She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex-spouse who told their kids she's gay without consulting the other parent. The user says the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their ex split ten years ago after a messy divorce, and they don't get along well but try for the kids. The ex didn't date much, while the author had two long-term girlfriends. The key issue is the ex coming out to the kids as gay, bringing her girlfriend around them, without consulting the author. The author is upset about being blindsided and worried about what the kids think of their previous marriage. They confronted the ex via text, but she didn't respond beyond scheduling issues.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for being upset or if the ex is wrong for not discussing this with them. The user's initial thought is the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking a different perspective.\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the rights of co-parents. In many places, once parents are divorced, they still have the right to be involved in their children's lives. If the ex made a significant life decision (like coming out) that affects the children, especially in front of them, and didn't inform the other parent, that could be an issue. Co-parenting usually involves communication, especially on matters that impact the children.\n\nHowever, the ex also has the right to live her life and form relationships. Coming out is a personal matter, and perhaps she felt it was necessary to be honest with the kids. But the way she did it\u2014without prior communication\u2014might be problematic. The author's concern is about the kids' understanding of their own family history and the sudden change in their parent's identity.\n\nBut wait, the author is also implying that the ex told the kids she's not bisexual but gay, which might be a point. However, the author is more concerned about how the kids perceive their own parent (the author) and the previous marriage. That's a valid concern because the kids might be confused about their mother's sexuality in relation to their father.\n\nBut in terms of rights, the ex has the right to her own identity and to introduce her new relationship to the kids. However, the lack of communication and collaboration with the other parent is a problem. Co-parenting requires mutual respect and cooperation, especially when it comes to issues that affect the children's well-being.\n\nThe author's actions in confronting the ex via text are understandable. They wanted to discuss it. The ex's response of only talking about scheduling suggests a lack of willingness to address the issue, which could be seen as dismissive. However, the author's initial approach was to confront via text, which might not be the best method for such a sensitive topic.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The ex's actions of not consulting might be the main issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset or for trying to communicate. However, maybe the author is overstepping by assuming the ex shouldn't have come out to the kids. The ex has the right to her own identity, and the kids might benefit from knowing their mother's truth.\n\nBut the author's role is to co-parent, and the ex's decision to introduce the girlfriend without prior discussion could affect the children's relationship with both parents. The author's concern is valid, but perhaps the ex should have communicated more. However, the author's method of confrontation might not be the best approach. Still, the core issue is the ex's unilateral decision, which could be wrong. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
