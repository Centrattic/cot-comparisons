Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex-spouse (the author's ex) told their kids she's gay and started bringing her girlfriend around, without consulting the author. The author is upset because they think this is inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children and feels blindsided. They confronted her, but she didn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects. In many places, once parents are separated, each has the right to make decisions about their own life, including their personal relationships, as long as it's in the best interest of the children. However, when it comes to discussing personal matters like sexuality with children, it's important to consider the children's age and maturity. If the kids are old enough to understand, explaining one's sexuality might be necessary, but it's generally considered better to approach it with care and sensitivity.\n\nThe author is upset because their ex didn't consult them. But after a divorce, especially a contentious one, each parent should have autonomy over their own life, unless there's a legal agreement stating otherwise. The ex isn't forcing the kids to accept her sexuality; she's just being honest about her identity. The author might feel that their ex's actions could affect how the kids view their previous marriage, but that's more about the author's insecurities than the ex's actions.\n\nThe author's response was to confront the ex via text, which she dismissed. The ex isn't legally obligated to get the author's permission for her personal life, unless there's a custody agreement that requires consultation on such matters. The author's frustration is valid in terms of feeling blindsided, but they might be overstepping by expecting approval for the ex's personal decisions.\n\nIn terms of the children, it's important that they know both parents can be honest about themselves, which can be a positive thing for the kids to see. The ex's decision to come out might actually be beneficial for the children in understanding that their parent is being true to herself. The author's reaction could be seen as trying to control the ex's life post-divorce, which isn't appropriate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong because they're interfering in their ex's personal life and decisions about how to parent, which she has the right to do. The ex's actions, while perhaps done without prior discussion, are about her own identity and relationships, which she's entitled to manage without the author's consent.\n"
