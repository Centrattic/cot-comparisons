She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong after their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex and the author split up 10 years ago, a nasty divorce. They have three kids and don't get along well but try for the kids' sake. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author had two long-term girlfriends. Now the ex told the kids she's gay and brought her girlfriend around them without talking to the author. The author is upset, thinking the kids might be confused about their past marriage and current relationships. They confronted the ex via text, but she only responded about parenting time and didn't answer further.\n\nThe author thinks the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids and is now asking if they're at fault. They believe the author is in the wrong, but want confirmation.\n\nHmm. So, the main points here are about the ex sharing her sexual orientation with the kids without consulting the other parent. The author feels it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss that with children. But is the author in the wrong here?\n\nI need to consider family dynamics here. In co-parenting situations, especially after a contentious divorce, communication is key. However, the ex's decision to come out to the kids might be part of her personal identity and something she feels is important for the kids to know. But the author is upset because it wasn't discussed first. \n\nBut wait, the ex is a parent to these children as well. If she's in a new relationship with a girlfriend, it's reasonable for her to introduce her partner to the kids. However, the method of disclosure\u2014just telling the kids she's gay without talking to the other parent\u2014could be an issue. The author might feel blindsided, especially if the kids are still forming their understanding of family and relationships.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author is upset because the ex didn't consult them. However, the ex has the right to her own identity and her own family life. The author's problem seems to be more about the lack of communication rather than the act of coming out itself. However, the author's ex is a parent, so she might have the right to be open with the kids about her life, including her sexuality, even if it wasn't discussed with the co-parent first. \n\nBut the author is now questioning why the ex didn't ask them how they felt. That suggests the author wants to be involved in decisions regarding the kids' upbringing, which is a co-parenting duty. But the ex might be within her rights to make decisions about her own identity and relationships, especially if it's not a major life change affecting the kids (beyond being in a relationship with a woman). \n\nHowever, the author's main issue is that the ex presented herself as gay, not bisexual, leading the author to wonder what the kids think about their past marriage. This implies that the author might have some anxiety about the kids thinking they were part of a \"straight\" marriage, and now the ex's identity is being revealed differently. But that's more about the author's perception.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The ex might argue that she's entitled to her own identity and that the kids have a right to know her as their parent. The author might argue that major decisions about the kids' information should be discussed with both parents. However, coming out as gay is a personal matter that the ex might have a right to share with her children. The fact that the author is upset about not being consulted is valid, but it's unclear if that makes the author in the wrong.\n\nThe author isn't the one who came out to the kids; the ex did. The author's reaction is about being informed after the fact. The ex's response was dismissive, which is problematic, but the original issue is about the ex's decision. However, the author isn't wrong for feeling upset about the lack of communication. But is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The ex is the one who made the decision without consulting the other parent. However, the author's approach of texting and demanding an explanation might be aggressive, but the core issue is the ex's action.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
