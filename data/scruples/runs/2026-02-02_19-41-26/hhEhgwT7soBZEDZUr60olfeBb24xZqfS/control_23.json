Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The ex also brought her girlfriend around the kids. The author is upset and thinks their ex didn't consider their feelings or the kids' well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author mentions that they had a bad divorce and things are tense. The ex didn't communicate, just dropped the information. The author feels it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the kids. But the author also says they \"fucked up\" and the divorce was long and nasty. However, the main issue here is whether the ex had the right to tell the kids about her sexuality without the author's input.\n\nIn many cases, when parents are separated, big decisions about the kids' lives should be made cooperatively. Introducing a new partner or discussing personal identity like sexual orientation could be something that requires mutual agreement. The ex didn't consult the author, which might be a problem. The author is concerned about how the kids are interpreting the information, thinking they might blame the author for the ex's sexuality or have confusion.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author's argument is that the ex shouldn't have made that decision without them. However, the author also acknowledges that they didn't have a good relationship post-divorce. The ex might have a right to her own identity and relationships, even if it's hard for the author. However, involving the kids is another matter. Parents usually have a responsibility to consider the children's best interests and communicate with each other on matters affecting them.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is wrong. The author is being defensive and might be projecting their own issues onto the ex. However, the ex's actions might have been abrupt and without consideration for the author's role as a co-parent. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about not being informed. The ex's failure to communicate is the main issue here. So the answer would be B\u2014author isn't in the wrong because the ex didn't consult them, which is a co-parenting responsibility.\n"
