Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the ex-spouse told the kids she's gay, which the author is upset about. They split ten years ago, and the divorce was bad. The author is concerned about how the kids are taking it and that his ex didn't consult him. He also mentions he's had two long-term girlfriends since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: the ex shared her sexuality with the kids without talking to the author first, and the author is upset because he thinks it's not appropriate for a parent to discuss such matters with children. But wait, the ex is still a parent, right? So in co-parenting situations, do both parents have a say in how certain topics are approached with the kids?\n\nThe author says he confronted her via text, but she didn't respond. He's asking if he's at fault here. From a co-parenting perspective, communication is important. If one parent feels that a topic is sensitive, they might expect to discuss it with the other parent first. But the ex might believe that her identity is her own and that she should be open with the kids about who she is. On the other hand, the author is worried about the kids' perception and their previous marriage, thinking they might think he's not supportive or that there's something wrong with him.\n\nBut is it the author's place to have a say in how his ex presents herself to their children? If the ex is in a relationship now, it's her life, and the kids are part of her life too. However, if the kids are still young, the way this information is presented could affect them. The author might be concerned about the suddenness and the lack of prior discussion. But the ex might believe that she has the right to live her life and be honest with the kids about her identity, especially if she considers herself a parent figure.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's own actions. He had two long-term relationships, but the ex didn't date much. Maybe that's a red herring, but it shows that the author has moved on. The ex is now in a relationship, and she's sharing her personal life with the kids. The author's main issue is the lack of consultation and the potential impact on the kids.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents generally have the right to make decisions about their children, but co-parents are expected to communicate. If the ex is the parent who is more involved in the kids' lives during her parenting time, she might feel it's her responsibility to be open. However, if the author is the other parent and the kids are split, then both parents should ideally be on the same page about major topics that affect their children.\n\nBut here's a catch: the author is upset because the ex labeled herself as gay, not bisexual, which might imply a rejection of the author's past. However, that's speculative. The main issue is whether the ex should have discussed this with the author first. If the kids are old enough to understand such topics, the author might have a valid point about not being consulted. However, the ex could argue that she has the right to her identity and that the kids need to know the truth.\n\nIn many cases, parents are encouraged to be open with their children about their identity, especially as it relates to the child's understanding of family and relationships. However, the author's concern is about the suddenness and lack of communication. Without knowing the age of the kids or the context of the ex's disclosure, it's hard to judge. But if the ex is in a relationship now, it's reasonable for her to introduce her partner to the kids.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is not the fact that the ex is gay but the lack of communication and possibly the method of disclosure. If the ex had discussed this with the author before talking to the kids, that would have been better. But the author is now upset and hasn't received a proper explanation. The ex's response about not being contacted during parenting time is a bit dismissive. However, the author's demand for an explanation could be seen as reasonable.\n\nIn terms of fault, the ex might be at fault for not discussing this with the author first, especially if it's a significant life change. However, the author might also be overreacting by assuming the worst about the kids' perception and not considering the ex's right to her identity. The key is whether the co-parenting agreement required prior discussions on such matters. If there was no such agreement, the ex might not be in the wrong.\n\nBut in co-parenting, communication is key. The ex didn't communicate, which is a problem. The author's anger is about not being consulted, not about the ex's sexuality itself. Therefore, the ex's fault is not in being gay but in not discussing it with the author first. However, the author's approach\u2014texting during parenting time\u2014might not be the best way to handle it. The ex's response might be a defense mechanism given the history of a nasty divorce.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but the ex is at fault for not communicating. However, the author's approach could be improved. But according to the question, we need to pick A (author is wrong) or B (not). The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is upset about not being consulted and the ex didn't discuss it, the author's stance is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
