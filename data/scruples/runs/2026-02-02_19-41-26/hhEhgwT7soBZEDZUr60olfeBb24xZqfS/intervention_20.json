Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong regarding their ex coming out as gay to their kids without consulting them.\n\nFirst, the situation is that the author and their ex are divorced but co-parenting three kids. The divorce was long and messy. The author admits they messed up, which might affect their current relationship. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex introduced her girlfriend to the kids and told them she's gay, not bisexual, which is causing the author to worry about the kids' perception of their previous marriage. The author feels it's not acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with the children and is upset because it was done without consultation. The ex didn't respond to the author's texts asking for an explanation.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parents have equal rights to make decisions about their children unless a court order specifies otherwise. However, the author's ex is the other parent, so she might have the right to share her personal information with the kids as part of her parenting role. The author might be assuming that the decision to come out to the kids required their agreement, but unless there's a specific custody arrangement that requires joint decisions on such matters, the ex might not need permission. \n\nBut the age of the kids is important here. If the kids are young, the approach to discussing sexuality would be different than if they're teenagers. The original post doesn't specify the kids' ages. However, the fact that they're being brought around the girlfriend might indicate the kids are at least in a stage where they can understand such concepts. \n\nThe author is upset because the ex didn't consult them. But unless there's a legal agreement requiring joint decision-making on parenting issues, the ex isn't necessarily wrong for making that choice. The author might be projecting their own feelings about the situation, especially given the history of a nasty divorce. The ex's response was dismissive, which could indicate that she feels her parental rights are being respected without the author's input.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about the kids' understanding of their previous marriage. If the author was married to the ex, and the ex is now in a same-sex relationship, the kids might be confused about their parents' past. However, the author's own relationships post-divorce might also influence the kids' perceptions. The author has had two long-term girlfriends, so perhaps the ex is trying to model her current relationship for the kids as part of her life now.\n\nThe key question is whether the ex's actions were inappropriate. Coming out to children is a personal decision, but it's also part of being a parent to be honest about one's identity. However, the manner in which it was done without prior discussion could be an issue. The author's reaction is based on the lack of communication, but if there's no legal requirement for such communication, the ex isn't necessarily at fault. The author might need to accept that the ex is part of the kids' lives and has the right to share her personal life with them unless there's a specific reason to believe it's harmful.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be more in the wrong for assuming they have control over the ex's decisions regarding her own identity and parenting style, especially if the ex has the legal right to make those decisions. However, if the author feels it's impacting their parenting, they might need to address it through a legal framework rather than blaming the ex. The answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the ex made a unilateral decision without considering the co-parent's perspective, but it's a bit of a gray area. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong (A) if the ex's actions are within her rights as a parent.\n"
