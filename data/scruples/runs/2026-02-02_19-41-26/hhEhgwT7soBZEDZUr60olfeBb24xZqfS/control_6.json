Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the ex-spouse) is at fault because their ex told their kids she's gay without consulting them. The ex also started bringing her girlfriend around the kids. The author feels blindsided and is upset that their ex didn't discuss this beforehand, especially since they have a contentious history.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, custody arrangements require both parents to be involved in major decisions about the child's upbringing. However, a parent's sexual orientation isn't typically considered a major decision that requires the other parent's consent. The ex is asserting her identity, which is a personal right. But introducing a new partner, especially after a history of conflict, might need some consideration for the children's well-being and the other parent's relationship with them.\n\nThe author is upset because the ex didn't consult them. But the ex's right to her own identity and relationships is important. However, the way she communicated this\u2014without prior discussion\u2014could have been more considerate. The author's approach of texting during parenting time might not be the best method for such a sensitive topic. The ex's response was dismissive, which is unhelpful, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is at fault.\n\nThe key points here are communication style versus the actual issue. The ex made a choice to disclose her sexuality to the kids, which is her right. The author's frustration is valid in terms of feeling excluded, but the ex isn't obligated to consult them on personal matters unless there's a legal agreement requiring co-parenting decisions. The main problem seems to be the lack of communication and the approach taken, rather than the disclosure itself.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether disclosing one's sexuality to children is a shared decision. Generally, it's the parent's right to live their life as they see fit. The author's issue is more about the method of communication and the ex's refusal to discuss it. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the ex's actions aren't inherently wrong either. The fault isn't on the author for being upset, but the ex's lack of consultation might be a co-parenting issue. However, since the author is asking if they are \"in the wrong,\" the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but the ex might be for not considering co-parenting communication. But the question is whether the author is at fault, which they aren't.\n"
