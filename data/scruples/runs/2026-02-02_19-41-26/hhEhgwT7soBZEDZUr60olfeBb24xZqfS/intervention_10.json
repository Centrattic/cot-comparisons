Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about an ex who told their kids she's gay without consulting the other parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex and author split ten years ago, and they have three kids. The ex hasn't dated much, but the author has had two long-term girlfriends. The ex came out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around them without discussing it with the author. The author feels it's inappropriate for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children and confronted the ex, but she didn't respond.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the author's ex made a significant life decision that affects the children without consulting the co-parent. That could be seen as a breach of co-parenting responsibilities. However, the author's past behavior is mentioned as having \"fucked up,\" leading to a contentious divorce. The author might be projecting their own issues onto the ex.\n\nThe ex's right to live her life and be authentic is important. However, co-parenting often requires communication and mutual respect for the children's well-being. The ex might have a right to her identity, but introducing her sexuality to the children without discussing it with the other parent could be problematic. It's possible the ex acted out of a desire to be honest with the kids or to share her identity, but proper communication is key in co-parenting.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on concern for the kids' understanding of their family history and potential confusion. However, the author also has a history of issues in the relationship. The ex's refusal to communicate further complicates things. The author might be in the right to want to discuss the matter, but maybe not in the way they presented it. The ex's actions could be seen as dismissive, but the author's initial approach via text might not have been ideal.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, co-parents should communicate about major decisions affecting the children. The ex's choice to come out without discussion might not be malicious, but it's a breach of protocol. The author's anger is understandable, but they also have a history of issues. It's a complex situation where both parties might have some fault, but the ex's action is more about personal identity, which is valid, even if the communication was lacking.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The ex's actions were abrupt, but the author's past issues might contribute to their current perspective. However, the author's approach to confrontation via text might not be the best method, but that's a different issue. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the ex made a significant decision without consultation, the author's concern is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
