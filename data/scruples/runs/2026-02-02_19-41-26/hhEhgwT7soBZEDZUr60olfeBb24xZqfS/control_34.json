Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that their ex, who they don't get along with, told their kids she's gay and is now bringing her girlfriend around them without consulting the author. The author is upset because they think the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids and didn't get their input.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, when parents are separated, both have the right to make decisions about their children unless there's a court order specifying otherwise. However, the author's ex is talking about her own sexuality, which might be a personal choice. The key issue here is whether the ex overstepped by informing the kids without the other parent's consent. \n\nThe author mentions that the divorce was nasty and they don't get along well. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term relationships. The author is concerned that the kids might think he's not gay, leading to confusion. But the author's main argument is that the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids without consulting him. \n\nOn the other hand, a parent's decision to come out as gay to their children is a personal matter. If the ex is a parent, she might have the right to discuss her identity with the children, especially if she's now in a relationship. However, if the children are minors, maybe the other parent should have been consulted, depending on custody arrangements. But the question is whether the ex is in the wrong. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA). The author didn't consult the ex about their own relationships, but the ex is talking about her own identity. The author might be upset because of the lack of communication, but the ex's action could be about her own truth. However, the author might not be in the wrong if the ex didn't communicate properly. \n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The ex made a significant decision without consulting the co-parent, especially regarding the children. It's important for both parents to communicate, especially when it affects the kids' upbringing. The author's anger is about not being informed and the potential impact on the kids, which is valid. The ex's response of not engaging further is also problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
