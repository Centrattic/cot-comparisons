Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ex-spouse) is in the wrong because their ex told the kids they're gay without consulting them. The author is upset that the kids might think the father is gay or that the marriage was based on a lie. \n\nFirst, the ex and the author are divorced and have kids. The ex didn't mention being gay before, and now they're introducing a girlfriend to the kids. The author feels blindsided and doesn't think it's appropriate for a parent to discuss sexuality with children.\n\nHmm. Legally, parents usually have the right to raise their children as they see fit, including their own identity. But this is more about the communication between co-parents. The ex didn't consult the author, which is a problem in co-parenting. But is the author in the wrong for not accepting this?\n\nThe author's main issue is that the kids might think he's gay or that their marriage was a lie. That's a valid concern because the kids might get confused if they were told the ex was straight during the marriage. But the ex's sexuality is their own, and coming out is a personal choice. However, deciding to inform the children without discussing it with the other parent could be seen as a breach of co-parenting responsibilities.\n\nThe ex's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the ex had a right to come out, but didn't communicate with the co-parent, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The author is upset about the lack of communication and potential confusion for the kids. But the author also admits they had a nasty divorce and don't get along, so maybe the ex's actions are part of that tension.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The ex came out without discussing it with the co-parent, which is a co-parenting issue. 2) The author is worried about the kids' perception. 3) The ex's dismissive response.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the ex didn't communicate, which is important in co-parenting. The author's concern is valid, especially regarding the kids' well-being. However, the ex's right to their identity is also important. But since the author is the one upset about the lack of communication and the potential impact on the kids, maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The ex's actions could be seen as overstepping if they didn't consider the co-parent's feelings, especially after a difficult split. So the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
