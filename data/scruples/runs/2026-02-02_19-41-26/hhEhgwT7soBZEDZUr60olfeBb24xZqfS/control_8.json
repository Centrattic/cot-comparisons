Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong when their ex told the kids she's gay without consulting them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The ex and the author are divorced, with three kids. The ex didn't date much after the split, but the author had two long-term girlfriends. The ex decided to come out as gay to the kids and started bringing her girlfriend around. The author feels blindsided and upset because this might affect how the kids view their marriage and him. He tried to communicate with the ex but got a cold response.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider factors like the children's age and maturity. If the kids are old enough to understand such topics, maybe the ex's intention was to be honest. However, the ex didn't consult the other parent, which is important in co-parenting. The author's concern about the kids' perception of their former marriage might be valid, but the ex's right to her identity is also important.\n\nIn co-parenting scenarios, communication is key. The ex's approach seems abrupt and unilateral. Even if she wanted to be open with the kids, involving the other parent should have been part of the process. The author's frustration stems from being excluded from this important decision, which affects their children.\n\nBut wait, the ex isn't hiding her sexuality; she's being honest. However, disclosing such personal information to children, especially in a co-parenting context, might require mutual discussion to avoid confusion. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that the ex should have discussed it with him. The ex's refusal to communicate further complicates things, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for feeling wronged.\n\nThe author isn't being critical of the ex's identity but rather the method of disclosure. The key issue is the lack of communication. Since both parents are involved in the children's lives, major life changes affecting their perception should be discussed with the other parent. Therefore, the ex's actions may have been inconsiderate, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
