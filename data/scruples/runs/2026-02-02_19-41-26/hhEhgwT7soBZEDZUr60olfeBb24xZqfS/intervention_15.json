Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-spouse who came out as gay to their kids without consulting the other parent. The author is upset because their ex didn't talk to them first and is now bringing her girlfriend around the kids. The author feels blindsided and is concerned about how the kids perceive their previous marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The ex and the author have three kids, and they have a history of a contentious divorce. The ex hasn't dated much, while the author has had two long-term relationships. The main issue is the ex coming out to the kids without discussing it with the author. The author is upset that the ex labeled herself as gay instead of bisexual, which might make the kids question the author's sexuality or their previous marriage.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have the right to make decisions regarding their children's upbringing. However, when it comes to personal matters like sexual orientation, there might not be a legal requirement to consult the other parent. But from a parental responsibility angle, communication is key. The ex might believe that as a parent, she has the right to express her identity to her children, especially if they are teenagers or older who might already be questioning their own identities.\n\nHowever, the author's concern is valid too. Sudden revelations can be confusing for children, especially if the parent didn't discuss it with the other parent first. The ex's response of not engaging in the conversation beyond scheduling might be seen as dismissive, which could escalate tensions.\n\nThe author's argument is that the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids without consultation. But the ex's decision to come out is a personal and important aspect of her identity. It's possible that the ex felt it was necessary for the kids to know her true self, especially if they are at an age where understanding their parents' identities is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction of confronting the ex via text and demanding an explanation could be seen as not supportive of the ex's identity. The author might be projecting their own discomfort onto the kids, worried about how the kids perceive them. However, the ex's right to express her identity isn't contingent on the other parent's approval, especially if the kids are old enough to handle such information.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If the kids are adolescents, it's important for both parents to communicate and perhaps discuss how to handle such situations. The ex's approach might have been abrupt, but her right to come out is her own. The author's reaction, while understandable, might be missing the point of supporting the ex's identity versus worrying about the kids' perceptions of him.\n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but neither is the ex. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), that would mean the author is not in the wrong. Alternatively, if there's a consideration that the author is not considering the ex's right to express her identity, then maybe A (Yes) could be the case. But given the context, the author's concern about communication is valid, and the ex's approach was abrupt. So the answer might be B because the author isn't wrong for being upset about the lack of communication, but maybe the ex isn't wrong for coming out to the kids.\n"
