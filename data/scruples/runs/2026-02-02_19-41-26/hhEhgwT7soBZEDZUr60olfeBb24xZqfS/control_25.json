Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-spouse revealing their sexuality to their children without prior discussion with the other parent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms regarding co-parenting. In many places, once divorced, each parent has the right to make decisions about their child's upbringing unless there's a court order stating otherwise. However, co-parenting often involves communication and mutual respect, especially when it comes to significant decisions affecting the children.\n\nThe ex told the kids she's gay and is bringing her girlfriend around them. The author is upset because they weren't consulted. The key issue here might be whether the ex had a legal obligation to consult the other parent. In some jurisdictions, there's no legal requirement for this, but there's an expectation in co-parenting that both parents discuss major life changes that affect the children.\n\nThe author's argument is that discussing sexuality with children was inappropriate and that they weren't informed. The ex's response was dismissive, which could indicate a breakdown in communication. But the author's actions\u2014confronting via text and demanding explanations\u2014might be seen as overstepping if the ex isn't legally bound to inform them. However, the author's concern is valid about the children's well-being and the potential impact of such a revelation.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's decision to come out as gay to the kids could be a personal choice, especially if she feels it's important for the children to know. However, introducing a new partner into the children's lives without the other parent's input might be problematic. The author's upset stems from the lack of communication and the potential confusion for the children.\n\nAnother angle is the author's past. They admit they \"fucked up\" in the marriage and the divorce was acrimonious. This might affect their credibility, but it's not directly relevant unless there's a history of abuse or neglect. The key here is the current behavior regarding the children.\n\nLegally, unless there's a custody agreement that requires such communication, the ex might not be in the wrong for making her own choices. However, ethically, co-parents are often advised to discuss matters that significantly affect the children. The author's reaction could be seen as reasonable in wanting to be informed, but the method of confrontation via text without a discussion might be where the author could improve.\n\nIn summary, the ex might not be in the wrong if there's no legal requirement to consult, but the lack of communication is ethically questionable. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset and wanting to discuss it, but their approach might be seen as confrontational. The answer hinges on whether the ex was obligated to inform the author. If not, then the answer would be B (author not in the wrong). If there's an expectation of communication, then maybe A, but in legal terms, it's more likely B.\n"
