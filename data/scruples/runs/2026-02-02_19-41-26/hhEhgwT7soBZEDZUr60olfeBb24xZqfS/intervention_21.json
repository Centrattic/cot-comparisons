She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's ex told their kids she's gay and is now bringing her girlfriend around them without consulting the author. The author is upset and thinks the ex didn't have the right to discuss her sexuality with the kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent-child relationship. Both parents are co-parents, right? Even though they're divorced, they have shared custody or joint custody of the kids. So, major decisions about the kids' upbringing usually require mutual agreement unless there's a court order. But here, the ex made a decision without consulting the author. The ex told the kids she's gay and introduced her girlfriend. That's a significant life change for the kids to hear, especially without the other parent being involved. \n\nThe author is concerned about how the kids are processing this. They mention that the ex didn't ask for their opinion, which is a valid point. Even if the ex wanted to come out to the kids, discussing her sexuality might be a personal matter, but when it involves the kids, they might need to be informed. But wait, the ex is the parent. Shouldn't she have the right to be open about her identity to her own children? But the other parent might feel it's their right to be involved in decisions affecting the kids. \n\nHowever, the author's main issue is that the ex didn't consult them. The ex's response was dismissive, only talking about scheduling. That could be problematic. But the author is focusing on the fact that the ex didn't ask for their opinion. But maybe the ex believes that as a parent, she has the autonomy to make decisions about her own family, even if it's a joint custody situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's own actions: the divorce was nasty, and the author admits they \"fucked up.\" They've had two long-term girlfriends, while the ex hasn't. The author is upset that the ex chose to say she's gay instead of bisexual, implying that the kids might think the author is gay. But the author is a man, and the ex is a woman, so maybe the author is assuming bisexuality is about same-sex attraction for women? That might not be the case, but the author is projecting their own insecurities here. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting the ex to discuss her sexuality with the kids? Maybe the ex had a right to be honest with her children. But the lack of communication is an issue. The author is upset that the ex didn't consult them, which is a co-parenting issue. However, the ex is also a parent, so maybe she has the right to make that decision for herself and her kids. \n\nThe key points are: 1) Did the ex have the right to inform the kids without the author's input? 2) Did the author have a right to be consulted? In co-parenting situations, it's usually best to communicate about major decisions. But the ex's sexuality is her personal matter. However, when it comes to the kids, maybe she should have discussed it with the co-parent to ensure consistency and support for the kids. \n\nThe author is upset about the method\u2014sudden announcement without discussion. The ex's response was dismissive, which could be a problem. But does that make the author right in their stance? The author is arguing that the ex shouldn't have discussed her sexuality with the kids without consulting them. However, the ex might argue that she has a right to be open with her children. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? If the ex didn't consult the author, that's a co-parenting failure. But the author might be overreacting by focusing on the sexuality issue instead of supporting the kids. However, the ex's decision could impact the kids' understanding of family dynamics, so communication between co-parents is important. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, if they are a co-parent, they should work with the ex to support the kids, even if they disagree. But the author is upset about being left out of the loop. The ex's response was unhelpful, but the author's reaction might be partly due to their own past issues with the ex. \n\nOverall, it's a complex situation. The ex might have a right to be open with the kids, but she should have communicated with the co-parent. The author's reaction might be valid in terms of wanting to be involved, but focusing on the sexuality aspect could be a red herring if the real issue is the lack of communication. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong, but maybe the ex is more at fault for not communicating. However, the author's approach might be problematic if they're using this as a way to deflect from their own past mistakes. But based on the question, the answer is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong here. So answer B.\n"
