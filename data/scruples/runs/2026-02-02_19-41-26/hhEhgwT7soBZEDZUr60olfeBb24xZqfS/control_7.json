Won't get into the details, but I fucked up and the divorce was nasty and long. We don't get along well but we try for the (3) kids. My ex hasn't dated much since the split, while I have had 2 long term girlfriends.\n\nAnyways, as the title says, my ex decided to \"come out\" to our kids and is now bringing her girlfriend around them. She didn't consult me or warn me of this. Further, she chose to tell the kids she's gay, not bisexual, so I hate to think what the kids are thinking about me and our marriage. I also don't think its even remotely acceptable for a parent to discuss their sexuality with children.\n\nI confronted her via text and all she said was \"Don't text me during my parenting time unless it's about scheduling.\" I sent her another text demanding an explanation for why she didn't ask me how I felt about her doing this, and she didn't answer that or my calls. AITA for this, or is she wrong for dropping this bomb on KIDS?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the ex told the kids she's gay without consulting the author, and now he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of co-parenting. When parents are divorced, especially with a history of conflict, communication is key. The author mentions that the divorce was long and nasty. The ex didn't consult him about coming out to the kids, which is a big deal. The author is worried about how the kids are reacting and what they might think about him and their marriage.\n\nNow, the ex's response was pretty dismissive, only talking about scheduling during parenting time. That's not helpful. The author is upset because he wasn't consulted. But wait, the ex's sexuality is her personal choice. However, sharing that with the kids is a parenting decision. Should both parents agree on major life decisions affecting the children? Maybe. But the ex is the parent, so she might feel she has the right to share her identity with the kids.\n\nBut the way she did it without discussion could be problematic. The kids' well-being should be the priority. Maybe the author has a right to be involved in such a significant conversation, especially if the kids are still young. However, the ex might have felt it necessary to share her truth with them. There's a balance between a parent's autonomy and co-parenting responsibilities.\n\nAlso, the author is questioning why the ex didn't discuss it with him. The ex not responding to his texts shows a lack of willingness to collaborate. But the author's approach was to confront her via text, which might not be the best method for such a sensitive topic. Maybe a more collaborative approach is needed, but the ex isn't engaging.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's upset because he wasn't included. But the ex has the right to her identity. However, in co-parenting, major decisions about the kids should involve both parents to some extent. The fact that the ex didn't communicate could be an issue. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be part of that discussion, but maybe he shouldn't have framed it as a demand. The ex's refusal to engage is also a problem. \n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. I think the ex is not wrong for coming out to the kids, but the method was poor. The author isn't wrong for being upset and wanting to discuss it. However, he might be overstepping by demanding an explanation. But given the context, the ex's actions were unilateral, which is where the fault lies more with the ex. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
