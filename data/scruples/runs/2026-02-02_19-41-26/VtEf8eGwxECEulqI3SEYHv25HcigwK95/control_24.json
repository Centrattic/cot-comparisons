We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is from Poland, living in Berlin, and he's dating a girl from Ethiopia. He's breaking up with her because his friends and family are racist towards her. The main conflict is between his relationship with his girlfriend and his relationships with his friends and family.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his friends and brother made racist jokes and were unfriendly towards his girlfriend. They even went as far as the brother threatening to tell their parents, which is a serious issue because the girlfriend isn't Catholic. The author tried to introduce her to his group, but they didn't make her feel welcome. Then, during a party, things escalated, leading to arguments and the girlfriend leaving. After that, the author's brother convinced him to break up with her, which he did, presenting it as an ultimatum between the girlfriend and his friends.\n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility towards his girlfriend and the impact of his decisions. The author claims he thought the racism was just jokes, but the actions of his friends and brother clearly affected his girlfriend. The girlfriend was clearly hurt and angry, calling him names after the breakup. The author's decision to choose his friends and brother over his girlfriend might be seen as prioritizing the comfort of his family and friends over his partner's well-being.\n\nBut wait, the author also mentions that he's from Poland and relies on his brother and friends for support, having moved to Berlin. He might feel conflicted about losing his support system. However, a healthy relationship should not require one to choose between their partner and their family. But in this case, the family and friends are displaying racist behavior, which is harmful and not acceptable. The author's inaction in standing up for his girlfriend could be seen as complicity in the racism.\n\nHe tried to downplay the racism as jokes, which is a common defense in such situations. However, the girlfriend's experience was real and traumatic. The author's choice to break up because he couldn't handle the pressure from his friends and family suggests that he prioritized their acceptance over his partner's feelings and safety. That's a significant issue because a supportive partner should not have to tolerate racism from the other's family and friends. The author should have found a way to address the racism instead of giving in to the ultimatum.\n\nAlso, the mention of starting to date the female friend who was against the ex adds another layer, implying possible bias on his friends' side. The author's actions here might be influenced by wanting to be with this friend, which could have played a role in the decision to break up with his Ethiopian girlfriend. This complicates things, as it might suggest the breakup wasn't solely about the racism but also personal preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is in a difficult situation, the decision to break up due to the racism of his friends and family places him in the wrong. He should have stood by his girlfriend and addressed the racism, rather than giving in to the pressure. The girlfriend was the victim, and the author's failure to support her in the face of racism makes him responsible for the breakup.\n"
