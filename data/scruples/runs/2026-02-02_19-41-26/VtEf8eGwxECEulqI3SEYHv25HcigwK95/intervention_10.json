We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because their friends and family are racist. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is from Poland, works and studies in Berlin. They met a girlfriend at their job in a hipster caf\u00e9, and she's from Ethiopia. When they tried to introduce her to their friends and brother, the friends were unfriendly, spoke only Polish, and made racist jokes. The brother even mentioned calling their parents about the girlfriend being a non-Christian. The author thought these were just jokes, but the girlfriend was upset. After a birthday party where things escalated with more racist remarks from the friends, the author broke up with the girlfriend, choosing their friends and family over her.\n\nThe key points here are that the author's friends and family are racist, and the author broke up with the girlfriend to keep their support. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral responsibility here. The author's friends and family are making the girlfriend feel unwelcome and are being racist. The author claims they didn't take it seriously at first, thinking it was just humor. But when the girlfriend left the party early and was upset, the author didn't take action to address the racism. Instead, they let it continue, even after the girlfriend expressed her feelings. When the situation escalated again at the birthday party, the author still tried to include the friends, which led to the breakup.\n\nThe author made a choice between their girlfriend and their friends/brother. The girlfriend was the one directly affected by the racism, and the author didn't stand up for her. Even though the author might have felt pressured by their family and friends, the ethical stand here is that supporting a relationship where one partner is being discriminated against by the other's family and friends is important. Choosing to side with the abusers against the victim is wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that after the breakup, they started \"dating\" the female friend who was against the ex. This could indicate a possible motive of aligning with the friends who opposed the girlfriend, which adds to the notion that the author prioritized their own social group over the girlfriend's well-being.\n\nIn terms of racism, it's a serious issue. The author's friends and brother made it clear that they were uncomfortable with the girlfriend's ethnicity and made racist jokes. The author's inaction in confronting this behavior and ultimately breaking up with the girlfriend to maintain their social connections shows a lack of support for their partner in a critical time. The girlfriend leaving because she felt unsupported is a valid reaction, and the author's decision to side with the racists makes them complicit in the discrimination.\n\nAnother angle is the initial belief that the jokes were just part of \"friendly\" humor. However, the girlfriend's experience and the subsequent actions of the friends (like the brother wanting to tell parents) show that it was indeed racism, not just harmless jokes. The author should have recognized the seriousness of the situation and taken steps to address it, not just dismiss it as a joke.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they chose to prioritize their friends and family's racist behavior over supporting their girlfriend, leading to the breakup. They failed to stand up against racism and instead let their social circle's prejudice dictate their relationship decisions.\n"
