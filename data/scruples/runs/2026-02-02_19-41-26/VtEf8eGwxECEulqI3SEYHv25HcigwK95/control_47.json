We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. The situation is that the author, from Poland, is in Berlin and met his girlfriend at work. She's Ethiopian. When he introduced her to his friends and family, they were unfriendly, using racist jokes and not speaking her languages. His brother even said he'd tell their parents about dating a non-Christian. The girlfriend was upset, and after a birthday party where things escalated, the author broke up with her. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's social circle has racist tendencies, he broke up with his girlfriend to maintain his relationships with them, and he's now dating the female friend who was against his ex. \n\nFirst, the author claims he didn't realize his friends were being racist, thinking it was just jokes. However, the girlfriend's experience shows that their behavior was harmful and exclusionary. The author's friends' actions\u2014speaking only Polish, making jokes, mocking her\u2014clearly made her feel unwelcome. The author's brother even threatened to inform their parents, which adds a layer of family pressure to conform to their views.\n\nThe author broke up with his girlfriend because he couldn't handle the conflict between her and his friends/family. He says it was an ultimatum: her or them. But in relationships, mutual respect and support are crucial. If his friends and family were not supportive of his partner, that's a significant red flag. The author chose to side with his friends over his girlfriend, which could be seen as prioritizing his social circle over his partner's well-being and the relationship itself.\n\nHowever, the author might feel conflicted because his friends and brother have been part of his life since childhood and have supported him in practical ways. But staying in a relationship where the partner is constantly devalued and excluded by the partner's own social group is unsustainable. The girlfriend's reaction was to leave, and the author's decision to break up might have been influenced by external pressure rather than his own conviction.\n\nThe author also mentions he's now dating the female friend who was against his ex. This could indicate a pattern of valuing the opinions of his friends over his girlfriend's needs. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author's friends and brother are the ones engaging in racist behavior, which is clearly wrong. However, the author is directly responsible for not standing up against their behavior and allowing it to impact his relationship. By breaking up with his girlfriend because of the racism from others, he's complicit in perpetuating the environment where that racism thrives. A healthy relationship should withstand external pressures, and the author's inability to protect his partner from those pressures suggests he didn't prioritize her needs as a partner should.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling him a weakling\u2014shows she felt he wasn't standing up for her, leading to her feeling unsupported. The author might be in the wrong for not defending his girlfriend against the racism and instead complying with his friends' and family's demands. \n\nIn summary, while the author's friends and brother are at fault for their racism, the author shares responsibility for not confronting their behavior and choosing to end the relationship rather than advocate for his girlfriend. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
