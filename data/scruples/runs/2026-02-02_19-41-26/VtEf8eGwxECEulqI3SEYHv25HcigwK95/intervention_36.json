We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because his friends and family were being racist towards her. The key points here are the context and the choices made.\n\nFirst, the author is Polish, living in Berlin, and his girlfriend is from Ethiopia. The friends and family were making racist jokes, using only Polish at the party so she couldn't participate, and even the brother was threatening to tell their parents about the girlfriend's religion. The author initially thought the racism was just jokes but realized the severity after the incidents. He tried to explain to his girlfriend that it was just humor but it led to conflicts. Eventually, after a party where things escalated, he broke up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From what I know, being in a relationship and facing racism from your partner's side is a serious issue. The author had the choice to stand by his girlfriend or his friends. Choosing family and friends over a partner in the face of racism might be seen as prioritizing his social circle over supporting his girlfriend. However, there's also the aspect of not wanting to lose his support system, especially since he's far from home.\n\nBut here's the thing: when someone faces racism from their partner's friends or family, the partner is expected to take a stand. The author's friends and family were actively making their partner feel unwelcome and using racist language. By not standing up for his girlfriend and instead choosing to break up, he might be complicit in the racism, even if he didn't participate. The girlfriend felt that the author didn't support her, leading to the breakup. The author's brother even pushed for the breakup, which adds to the idea that the author was under pressure but made a choice that hurt his girlfriend.\n\nAlso, the author later started dating a female friend, which might indicate that he wasn't truly committed to his ex and perhaps used the family issues as an excuse. His justification about not wanting to lose his friends since childhood is a common one, but it doesn't excuse the decision that led to the breakup caused by racism.\n\nSo, in ethical terms, when someone is in a relationship and their partner's friends are being racist, the correct action would be to support their partner against the racism, not to side with the racists. The author's choice to break up because of the friends' racism suggests that he prioritized his friends over his girlfriend, which is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
