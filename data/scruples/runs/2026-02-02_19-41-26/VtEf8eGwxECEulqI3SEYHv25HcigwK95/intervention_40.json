We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist towards her. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The guy is from Poland, living in Berlin. He started dating a girlfriend from Ethiopia. When he introduced her to his friends and family, they were unfriendly, using racist jokes and not speaking English or German, making her feel isolated. His brother even threatened to tell their parents. After a birthday party where things escalated with more racist comments and a scene from the girlfriend, he ended up breaking up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her.\n\nNow, the ethical question here is whether choosing to break up with a partner to maintain relationships with family and friends who are being racist is the right decision. Legally, in many places, relationships are personal, but in terms of morality and social responsibility, there's a lot to unpack.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. The friends and family members were engaging in behavior that made the girlfriend feel unwelcome and dehumanized. The boyfriend initially dismissed their behavior as \"jokes,\" which is a common defense for racist actions. However, when his girlfriend confronted them, they escalated the situation. The boyfriend's decision to break up with her because of their racism is framed as an ultimatum\u2014her or them. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting family and friends who exhibit racist behavior can be seen as complicity, even if one isn't directly participating. The boyfriend's actions suggest he prioritized his comfort and relationships over standing up against racism. By choosing to end the relationship with his girlfriend, he avoids confronting the racism directly, which could be seen as enabling the behavior of his friends and family. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling him a weakling and using strong language\u2014is understandable given the context. She was the target of racism and felt betrayed when he didn't support her. His breaking up with her was likely a result of feeling cornered by his social group's pressure rather than a genuine decision made for her well-being. \n\nAdditionally, the mention of starting a relationship with a female friend who was against his ex adds layers of complexity. It might suggest that his decision wasn't purely about her but also influenced by other relationships. \n\nIn many cultures and ethical frameworks, standing up against discrimination is a moral obligation, even if it means losing relationships. Choosing to side with those who discriminate over the victim is generally considered the wrong choice. Therefore, the author's decision to break up with his girlfriend because of his friends' racism places him in the wrong. The correct action would have been to support his girlfriend and address the racism within his social circle, perhaps by confronting his friends and family or distancing himself from them if they refused to change their behavior.\n"
