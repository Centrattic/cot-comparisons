We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because his friends and family were being racist towards her. The key points here are about racism, personal relationships, and the decision to choose between the girlfriend and his social circle.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his friends and brother made racist jokes and were unfriendly towards his Ethiopian girlfriend. The brother even threatened to tell the parents about the girlfriend's religion, which the author thought was a joke but the girlfriend took seriously. Then, during a party, tensions escalated with racist remarks, leading the girlfriend to leave in anger. The author ended up breaking up with her, choosing to stay with his friends and brother.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From what I understand, racism is a serious issue, and supporting or allowing racist behavior can be problematic. The author might have justified his actions by saying he didn't support the racism but didn't confront his friends or brother, perhaps out of fear of losing his support network. However, choosing to stay in a group that is hostile towards his partner could be seen as a betrayal of his partner's well-being.\n\nThe girlfriend was clearly upset by the treatment she received, and the author's decision to break up might be seen as him prioritizing his family and friends over his partner's feelings and safety. Even if the author didn't directly make the racist comments, his inaction in stopping them and his eventual decision to leave the relationship could be interpreted as complicity or a lack of support for his partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he was under pressure from his family and friends and felt trapped between two conflicting groups. But in terms of right and wrong, supporting a partner in the face of racism is generally considered the ethical choice. The fact that he ended the relationship because his social circle couldn't accept his girlfriend suggests that he valued his existing relationships over his romantic partner's experience and happiness.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that after the breakup, he started \"semi-dating\" a female friend who was against his ex. This might indicate a pattern of choosing people who support him, which could further show a lack of commitment to his partner.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to be racist, his decision to break up with his girlfriend due to his family and friends' racism implies that he prioritized his toxic social circle over her well-being. That makes him at least partially responsible for the situation.\n"
