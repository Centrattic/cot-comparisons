We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. The situation is that the author is from Poland, living in Berlin, and his girlfriend is Ethiopian. His friends and brother made racist jokes and weren't accepting of her. He tried to introduce her to them, but it led to conflict. Eventually, he broke up with her to keep his friends and brother, creating an ultimatum between her and them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author made the right choice. The key here is whether he was responsible for the situation. His friends and family had a toxic environment, making her uncomfortable and even racist remarks. The author claims he didn't realize the extent of their racism at first, thinking it was just jokes. However, when his brother explicitly said he'd tell their parents about the non-Christian aspect, that's a serious issue. The girlfriend was clearly hurt and called the friends out, leading to a scene. The author then broke up with her, feeling pressured by his brother and friends.\n\nThe girlfriend was the \"wronged party,\" as the author admits. By choosing to side with his friends and brother, he prioritized their acceptance over her well-being. Even if the relationship might not have lasted, the fact that he ended it because of external pressure from a racist environment is problematic. A healthy relationship shouldn't require the person to choose between their partner and their toxic family/friends. The author allowed their racism to influence his decision, which is a failure to stand up for his partner.\n\nAdditionally, he mentions that he's now \"kinda dating\" the female friend who was against his ex, which might indicate a lack of loyalty and further shows he's choosing the group's approval over his ex's feelings. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't support his girlfriend despite knowing about the racism, and he let his family and friends' prejudices dictate his relationship decision.\n"
