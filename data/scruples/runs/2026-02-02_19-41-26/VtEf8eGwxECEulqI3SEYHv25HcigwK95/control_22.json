We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is from Poland, living in Berlin, dates a girl from Ethiopia. His friends and family, including his brother, are being racist towards her. The guy didn't realize how bad it was at first because he thought the jokes were just for fun. Then, when he tries to introduce his girlfriend to them, things go poorly. The brother and friends make racist comments, and after a party where things escalate, the guy ends up breaking up with his girlfriend because he can't choose between her and his family and friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's friends and family were actively racist. The girlfriend was being excluded by not speaking her language, making jokes, and even the brother threatening to tell the parents. The author didn't confront them at first but thought it was just jokes. Then, after the girlfriend's attempts to stand up for herself and the resulting arguments, he breaks up with her, choosing his family and friends over her.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, the problem here is that the author didn't stand up for his girlfriend. He tried to downplay the racism, thinking it was just jokes, and then when the racism actually affected his relationship, he broke up with her instead of supporting her. That seems like he's not taking a stand against racism. Choosing to stay with friends and family who are racist rather than supporting his girlfriend in a relationship where she's being discriminated against is a clear issue.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's dating a friend of the family after the breakup adds another layer. The female friend was against the ex, which might indicate complicity in the racism. The author's decision to break up because he couldn't lose his friends and brother shows that he prioritized his existing relationships over standing by his girlfriend in the face of racism. That's problematic because racism is a serious issue that shouldn't be tolerated. The girlfriend was the one being targeted and didn't deserve to be in a relationship where her partner wasn't protecting her from racism. The author's failure to support her and his choice to break up because of his own fear of losing his family and friends makes him at fault.\n"
