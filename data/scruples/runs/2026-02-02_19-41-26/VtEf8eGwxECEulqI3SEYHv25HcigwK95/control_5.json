We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is from Poland, living in Berlin. He started dating a girl from Ethiopia, which his friends and family didn't take well. They made racist jokes and were unfriendly towards her. The brother even threatened to tell their parents, which the author found problematic. The girlfriend was upset because the friends wouldn't speak English or German at the party, making her feel excluded. Later, at a birthday party, tensions escalated with more jokes, leading to an argument, and the author ended up breaking up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points here are about loyalty, racism, and the impact of his decisions. The friends and family's racist behavior is clearly harmful. The author might have thought he was being neutral or trying to keep peace, but by staying with his friends, he's enabling their racism. The girlfriend left because she felt unwelcome and disrespected. Breaking up because of others' racism could be seen as a way to avoid conflict, but it might also mean he didn't stand up for her. \n\nBut wait, the author says he tried to explain the differences to his family, and they were making jokes. He might not have realized how serious it was. However, when the girlfriend confronted the issues, he didn't support her enough. The ultimatum situation is tricky. If he couldn't support his girlfriend despite knowing his friends' racism, that's a problem. Relationships require mutual respect and support, and if the partner feels that the other person can't stand up against harmful behavior, that's a valid reason to end things. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel pressured by his family and friends. But choosing family over a partner in the face of racism is a tough choice. However, the fact that his friends' actions were racist and he didn't actively confront them could mean he's complicit. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014calling him a weakling\u2014suggests she felt he didn't have her back. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he knew his friends were being racist and didn't take steps to address it, protecting them over his partner shows that he prioritized his own comfort and relationships over her well-being. That would make him wrong. Alternatively, if he genuinely felt he couldn't change his family's views and couldn't handle the conflict, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But given that the racism was clear and he didn't support his girlfriend when she needed it, he's likely in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
