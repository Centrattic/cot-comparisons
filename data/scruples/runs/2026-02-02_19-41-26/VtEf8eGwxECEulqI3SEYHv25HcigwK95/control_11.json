We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. The situation involves the girlfriend being Ethiopian, and the author's friends and brother making racist jokes and not accepting her. The author ended up choosing his friends and family over the girlfriend, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The author's friends and brother were unfriendly towards his girlfriend, using Polish and not English or German, making racist jokes, and even the brother threatening to tell their parents. The girlfriend was upset and the author tried to downplay it initially, thinking it was just humor. But after another incident at a birthday party where things escalated, the author broke up with her, choosing his friends and brother.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The main ethical consideration here is whether the author is responsible for the actions of his friends and family. While racism is clearly wrong, the author is making a choice to prioritize his social circle over his partner. However, the girlfriend was the victim of discrimination, and the author's decision to leave her might be seen as abandoning her in a situation where she was being targeted. On the other hand, the author might feel pressured by his family and friends, especially since the brother helped him financially and they've known each other since childhood.\n\nBut here's the thing: the author is an adult and should be responsible for his own relationships. Even if his friends and family are part of his support system, they shouldn't dictate his choice of partner. The author's decision to break up because his friends didn't accept his girlfriend is problematic because it's her right to be respected, and he should have stood by her instead of choosing the people who were being racist. The fact that he later started dating the friend who was against his ex might compound the issue, showing a lack of support.\n\nSo, in this case, the author is in the wrong because he allowed the racism of his friends and family to influence his decision to end the relationship, which was not his girlfriend's fault. The girlfriend was the victim, and the author didn't take a stand against the racism. Therefore, Answer A (the author is in the wrong) is appropriate.\n"
