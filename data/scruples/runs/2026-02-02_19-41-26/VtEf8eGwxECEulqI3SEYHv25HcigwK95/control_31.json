We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because their friends and family are racist. The main issue here is that the author's friends and family were being racist towards the GF, using offensive jokes and not including her in conversations during social events. The author tried to downplay it at first, thinking it was just humor, but the GF left early due to the hostility. Then, when they tried to have a joint birthday party, things escalated into arguments and the GF left in anger. The author's brother even threatened to tell their parents, which adds another layer of pressure.\n\nThe author then breaks up with the GF, choosing their friends and family over her. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nFirst, the author's friends and family exhibited clear racist behavior. Even if they're family, their actions were harmful and exclusionary. The GF was directly targeted, and the author didn't support her adequately. The fact that the author's brother used religion as a reason to oppose the relationship (even though the GF is a different Christian denomination) shows a lack of respect and understanding.\n\nThe author tried to rationalize the racism as just jokes, which is a common way people dismiss real issues. However, the GF's experience was real and hurtful. The author's decision to break up could be seen as prioritizing their social circle over the GF's well-being, which is a valid point the GF was upset about. \n\nBut the author also mentions that they were dependent on their family and friends for support, which complicates things. However, choosing to stay in a relationship that's constantly undermined by racism in this environment might not be sustainable. The author might feel they couldn't support the GF adequately if their own network was hostile.\n\nHowever, the key point is that the author allowed the racism of their friends and family to influence the breakup. Even if the author struggled to support the GF, the responsibility lies with them to stand up against the racism. The GF's decision to end the relationship because of the toxic environment is understandable. The author's choice to break up because of the family's racism does make them at fault because they didn't fully support their partner against the discrimination. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they allowed the racism of their network to dictate the relationship's end rather than confronting the issue or supporting their partner.\n"
