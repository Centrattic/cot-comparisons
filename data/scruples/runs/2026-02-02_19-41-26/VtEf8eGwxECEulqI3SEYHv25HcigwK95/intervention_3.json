We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family were racist. The situation is that the author is Polish living in Berlin, dating a woman from Ethiopia. His friends and family, including his brother, made racist comments and jokes, and during a party, tensions led to a fight. The author eventually broke up with her, choosing his friends and family over her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is whether the author made a wrong choice by prioritizing his friends and family over his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt targeted and isolated at the parties, which is a serious issue. The author thought the racism was just jokes, but he realized that his friends and family actually meant it, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important. She left the party early, was upset, and later confronted them. She felt that the author didn't support her, which led to the breakup. The author felt pressured by his brother and friends to end the relationship to avoid losing them. He also mentions that he's now dating a female friend, which might have influenced his decisions.\n\nEthically, choosing between a partner and family/friends can be complex, but the fact that the friends and family were being racist is a significant factor. In many societies, racism is a serious issue, and supporting friends who are racist can be seen as complicit. The author's decision to prioritize his friends over his girlfriend might be seen as enabling the racist behavior, which is problematic.\n\nHowever, the author might have felt he was in an impossible situation, especially if his family and friends are his main support network. But from an ethical standpoint, standing up against racism is crucial. The girlfriend was the one being targeted, and the author's support was lacking, leading to her feeling isolated.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014ultimately breaking up because of the friends' racism\u2014could be seen as failing to protect his partner from discrimination. Even if the author believed it was a joke initially, continuing the relationship in that environment shows a lack of support for his girlfriend's well-being. The decision to break up under the pressure of friends suggests that he valued their approval over his partner's dignity and safety.\n\nIn many cases, relationships require mutual respect and support, which includes standing against harmful behaviors. Choosing to end the relationship because of others' racism, rather than addressing it, could be considered wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he prioritized his friends over his responsibility to support his partner against racism.\n"
