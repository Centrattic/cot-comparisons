We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is from Poland, living in Berlin, and they broke up with their girlfriend because their friends and family were being racist towards her. The girlfriend is from Ethiopia, and their friends and brother made racist jokes and were unfriendly. The person tried to downplay it as just jokes, but after a couple of incidents where the girlfriend was uncomfortable, they ended up breaking up. They feel like they had to choose between their partner or their friends and family.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether the person is in the wrong. On one hand, they ended the relationship because their social circle was being racist. But on the other hand, supporting a partner when others are being discriminatory is a big part of a healthy relationship. The person might have felt pressured by their family and friends, but choosing to leave the relationship instead of standing up against racism could be seen as a failure to support their partner.\n\nThe author mentions that their friends and brother made racist jokes and were unfriendly towards the girlfriend. Even if it was presented as a joke, it's still harmful. The girlfriend left early from the party because she couldn't communicate and was treated poorly. The author defended their friends initially, but after the girlfriend was upset, they still tried to reconcile by saying the friends were just joking. Then, when the girlfriend confronted the friends again at a birthday party, things escalated, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here: the author's social circle was racist, the author didn't take it seriously enough, and ultimately chose to leave the relationship rather than address the racism. The girlfriend felt she couldn't be with someone who couldn't stand up for her against their own friends and family. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other against discrimination is crucial. If the author couldn't stand up for their partner when faced with racism from their own family and friends, then they might be at fault. The ultimatum \"her or them\" is a real conflict, but in this case, the author chose the latter, which could indicate that they prioritized their own social circle over their partner's well-being and dignity. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author recognized the racism as a serious issue and failed to take a stand. Since the author downplayed the racism and allowed their friends' behavior to influence the relationship's outcome, they are in the wrong. The girlfriend was right to feel wronged, and the author's choice to break up because of the friends' racism shows a lack of support. So, Answer A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
