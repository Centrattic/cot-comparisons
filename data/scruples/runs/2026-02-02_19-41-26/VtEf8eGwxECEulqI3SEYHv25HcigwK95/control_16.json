We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the author is from Poland, living in Berlin. He started dating a girl from Ethiopia. When he introduced her to his friends and brother, they weren't friendly. They spoke only Polish, which she couldn't understand. Then his brother directly asked why he's dating a \"black person,\" which is racist. The group makes racist jokes and tropes, and even the former Turkish manager wasn't enough to change their behavior. His brother even threatened to tell their parents, which adds to the pressure.\n\nAfter the first incident, the author tried to explain the situation to his girlfriend, but she was upset. Then, when they tried a birthday party together, things escalated with more racist jokes and arguments, leading to the breakup. The author then breaks up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her. Now, he's considering dating a female friend who was against his ex.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author is responsible for his friends' and family's racism. He claims he didn't realize they were serious about their racism before, thinking it was just jokes. However, the actions of his brother and friends clearly indicate racism. The girlfriend was directly targeted, and the author's friends made her feel unwelcome. The author's decision to prioritize his family and friends over his girlfriend's well-being raises questions about his responsibility.\n\nEven if he didn't intend to be racist, by not standing up for his girlfriend and allowing his circle to make her feel excluded and attacked, he's complicit. The fact that he later started dating someone else who was against his ex might suggest he's not taking her feelings seriously. The ultimatum \"her or them\" is problematic because he's choosing his toxic circle over a relationship that was valid and respectful.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he didn't support his girlfriend against the racism and instead allowed his friends' and family's behavior to dictate the end of the relationship. He should have addressed the racism directly rather than breaking up with her.\n"
