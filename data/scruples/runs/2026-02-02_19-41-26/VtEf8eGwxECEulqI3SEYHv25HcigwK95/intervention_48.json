We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy is from Poland but lives in Berlin. He works in a restaurant and is dating a girlfriend from Ethiopia. He introduces her to his friends and family, but they're not welcoming. The friends and brother make racist jokes and use Polish instead of English/German, making the girlfriend unable to communicate. The brother even threatens to tell their parents about the girlfriend being non-Christian. The girlfriend is upset and later confronts the friends during a birthday party, leading to a scene. Eventually, the guy breaks up with her, choosing his friends and family over her.\n\nThe key points here are the racism from the friends and family, the girlfriend's experience, and the decision to break up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nRacism is a serious issue. The fact that the friends and family were making racist jokes and creating an unwelcoming environment for the girlfriend is problematic. The author initially thought the jokes were just humor but realized they were offensive. However, he still chose to side with his friends and family, leading to the breakup. \n\nThe girlfriend clearly felt marginalized and criticized the friends' lack of education. The author's brother even tried to convince him to break up, which might have pressured him. The author mentions that he can't abandon his friends and family who've been supportive since childhood. But the girlfriend was the one who was the target of racism, so the author's choice to stay with his family might be seen as supporting the racist behavior, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and support are important. If the author's environment is not accepting of his partner, it could lead to ongoing issues. The author's decision to break up could be seen as giving in to the racism rather than standing up for his partner. However, the girlfriend did call him a weakling, which might indicate some conflict on her end too. But the main issue is the racism from his side.\n\nSo, considering that racism is a systemic issue and the author didn't protect his girlfriend from it, he might be in the wrong for prioritizing his friends and family over her well-being. Breaking up because of the toxic environment created by his own people, who were being racist, makes him complicit or at least not standing against racism. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
