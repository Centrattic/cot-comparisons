We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is at fault for breaking up with their girlfriend because their friends and family are racist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is from Poland, living in Berlin. He's in a relationship with a girlfriend from Ethiopia. When he tries to introduce her to his friends and brother, they aren't welcoming. They use racist jokes and only speak Polish, making her feel excluded. The brother even mentions calling their parents to complain about her religion. Despite initial resistance, the author continues the relationship but then hosts a birthday party where tensions escalate. The girlfriend confronts the friends' racism, leading to a scene and her leaving. After that, the brother pressures the author to break up, which he does. The author feels torn between his partner and his family/friends, eventually choosing the latter.\n\nNow, the key points here are the author's actions and his justification. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user wants a simple A (yes) or B (no) answer. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author knew his friends and brother had racist tendencies but initially thought it was just jokes. When the girlfriend was mistreated, he tried to explain it away as humor. Later, after the incident at the party, he broke up with her to keep his relationship with his family and friends. The girlfriend felt wronged, and the author's decision led to the breakup.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, supporting a partner against family and friends' racism is important. If someone is in a relationship and their partner is being discriminated against by their social circle, the right thing would be to stand with their partner. The author, instead, chose to side with his family and friends, leading to the breakup. This could be seen as prioritizing his social ties over his partner's well-being and respecting her dignity.\n\nHowever, there's a mention that the author was influenced by his brother and friends, and perhaps felt pressured. The girlfriend was also confrontational during the party, which might have contributed to the conflict. But the main issue is the author's decision to break up due to the racism. Even if the author felt torn, choosing to end the relationship because of others' racism could be considered supporting the racist environment indirectly.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction (calling him a weakling) is another point, but her anger is justified given the situation. The author's choice to not support her in the face of racism is the crux here. In many perspectives, standing up against racism is a moral duty, and choosing not to do so could make the author complicit, even if he thought it was just jokes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he allowed his family and friends' racism to dictate the end of a relationship, rather than standing by his partner. Therefore, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
