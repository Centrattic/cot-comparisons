We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of his friends and family's racism. So, the author is from Poland but studies in Berlin. He dates a girl from Ethiopia, and when he introduces her to his friends and brother, they are not accepting. They use racist jokes, avoid speaking English/German, and make her uncomfortable. The brother even threatens to tell their parents, which is a big deal because the girl is a non-Christian. Then there's a birthday party where things escalate, leading to a breakup. The author breaks up with her, choosing his friends and family over her, and later starts dating a female friend who was against the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the racism from his family and friends, the impact on his girlfriend, and his decision to choose his support network over her. \n\nThe author mentions that his friends and brother made racist comments and jokes, which the girlfriend found offensive. Even if the author thought it was a joke, the reality is that their behavior was racist. The girlfriend was the one directly affected, and the author's support system was not supporting her. By choosing to break up with her because his friends and family were uncomfortable, he's essentially choosing to stay in an environment where his partner is not accepted, which can be seen as complicity in the racism.\n\nAdditionally, the author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as a betrayal of his partner's trust and safety. The girlfriend was clearly hurt and upset by the treatment, and the author's response was to side with the people who were making her feel unwelcome. That seems like a clear-cut case of the author being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that he later starts dating a friend who was against his ex might indicate that he's prioritizing his social circle over his partner's well-being even more. This suggests that his decision was influenced by wanting to maintain his existing relationships rather than standing by his partner.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel trapped between his family and friends, but that doesn't excuse his actions. He could have tried to address the racism, set boundaries with his friends, or support his partner more actively. The ultimatum he faced isn't a valid reason to side with the racists. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to break up with his girlfriend because of his friends' racism makes him complicit in the problem. He should have supported his partner and worked to change the behavior of his friends, not the other way around.\n"
