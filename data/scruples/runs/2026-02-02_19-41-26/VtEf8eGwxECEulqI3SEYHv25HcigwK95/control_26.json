We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. The scenario is that he's from Poland, living in Berlin, has a girlfriend from Ethiopia, and his friends and brother are being racist. He broke up with her because of the pressure from his friends and family, who weren't accepting of her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author's main point is that he's facing an ultimatum: her or his friends and family. He felt he couldn't maintain the relationship because of their racism. However, the girlfriend was clearly hurt by the friends' behavior and the brother's threat to tell their parents. The author also mentions that he tried to introduce her to his friends, but they weren't respectful, using racist jokes and not even speaking her language. \n\nThe key factors here are the author's responsibility. Even if he didn't personally hold the same racist views, by not standing up for his girlfriend against his friends and family, he might have contributed to her discomfort. The girlfriend was left in a hostile environment during the parties, and the author didn't protect her. The fact that he later started dating a female friend who was against his ex might indicate that he's choosing his social circle over his girlfriend's well-being.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other is crucial. If the author's social circle is toxic, it's his responsibility to distance himself from them to protect the relationship. By breaking up with his girlfriend because his family and friends didn't accept her, he's prioritizing his own social ties over her and their relationship. That's a significant issue because it shows he's not willing to stand up for his partner against racism. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of his brother helping him financially and emotionally. But that shouldn't override the importance of a healthy relationship. The author's decision seems to be a choice to stay with the people who are causing the racism rather than confronting it. This makes him complicit in the racism by not taking a firm stance. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel torn, the wrong lies in his decision to prioritize his friends and family's acceptance over his girlfriend's dignity and the relationship itself. He should have addressed the racism directly instead of breaking up with her. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
