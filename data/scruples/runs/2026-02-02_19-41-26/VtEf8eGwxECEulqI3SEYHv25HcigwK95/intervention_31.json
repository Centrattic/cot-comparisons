We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy is from Poland but living in Berlin. He met his girlfriend at his job, which is a hipster caf\u00e9. She's from Ethiopia, and he's happy with her. He wants to introduce her to his friends and family, but they aren't friendly. The friends and brother use Polish among themselves, making her feel excluded. The brother even mentions calling their parents about the girlfriend being a non-Christian. Then there's a party where racist jokes escalate, leading to the girlfriend leaving. After another party where things go badly, the guy breaks up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her. He also mentions that he's now \"dating\" a female friend, possibly as a reason for the ex's anger.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether he is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me consider the key points. The girlfriend is dealing with racism from his family and friends. The guy initially thought the racism was just jokes but realized it was serious when the manager from Turkey was okay. His brother's comment about calling parents is a clear example of prejudice. The girlfriend was clearly hurt and wanted him to take a stand against the racism. The guy, however, tried to downplay it, convincing her that the friends weren't really racist, but when the situation escalated, he broke up with her to avoid losing his friends and brother. He also mentioned that he's now dating a female friend, which might have influenced his decision.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other through challenges is important. If his girlfriend felt unwelcome and the man couldn't stand up for her against his family and friends, that's a problem. Choosing to stay with friends who are being racist over a partner who's being targeted shows a lack of support and empathy. The girlfriend's reaction was understandable given the environment she was placed in.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might feel torn between his family and his partner. However, in a healthy relationship, mutual respect and support are crucial. If his friends and family can't accept his partner, it's a sign that they might not be supportive of his choices, which can affect the relationship. But the fact that he broke up with her to avoid losing his family and friends suggests that he prioritized his existing relationships over her well-being.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The girlfriend was being discriminated against, and the man didn't take a firm stand. He allowed the toxic environment to persist, leading to the breakup. By choosing to end the relationship to stay with his friends, he let the racism influence his decision against his partner. That's a yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
