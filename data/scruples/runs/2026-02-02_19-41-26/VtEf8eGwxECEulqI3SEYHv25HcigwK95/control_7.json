We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. So, the main issue here is the decision to end the relationship due to the racism from his social circle.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is Polish, living in Germany, and dating a woman from Ethiopia. His friends and brother, however, are making racist jokes and not being inclusive. When he introduces her to them, they don't interact with her, stick to their language, and make racist comments. The brother even threatens to tell their parents, which is a serious issue. The girlfriend ends up feeling excluded and the parties don't go well. Eventually, he breaks up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nI should consider the ethical implications. Racism is clearly wrong, and the author's friends and family are displaying harmful behavior. However, the author's response is to end the relationship rather than confront the racism. Is that a failure on his part to support his girlfriend? Relationships require support and standing up for each other, so if the author didn't challenge the racism, he might be complicit.\n\nThe author mentions that he thought the racist jokes were just humor, but when they targeted his girlfriend, it became clear it wasn't just joking. He also tried to convince the girlfriend that it was okay, but she felt it wasn't. The fact that he broke up with her to keep his friends suggests he prioritized his existing social group over her well-being. That seems like a problem because he didn't take a stand against the racism in his own circle.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's anger and the scene at the party indicate that the racism was a significant issue for her. The author's brother even pressured him to break up, which adds another layer of coercion. If the author is under pressure from family to conform to their racist views, it shows a lack of personal integrity.\n\nThe author also mentions starting a relationship with a female friend, which might have influenced his decision. That introduces potential bias or inconsiderate motives. The ultimatum \"her or them\" is a problematic approach because it forces the girlfriend to choose between his support and his family, which is not a fair or healthy dynamic.\n\nIn conclusion, the author made the wrong choice by not standing up against racism in his social circle and instead choosing to end the relationship. Supporting a partner against family's harmful behavior is a key aspect of a healthy relationship. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
