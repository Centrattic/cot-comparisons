We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves breaking up with a girlfriend because friends and family are racist towards her.\n\nFirst, the author is from Poland, now in Berlin. He dates a woman from Ethiopia. His friends and family, including his brother, behave in a racist manner during social gatherings. They use racist jokes and exclude her by speaking only Polish. His brother even mentions telling their parents about the non-Christian aspect. The author tried to downplay the racism, thinking some jokes were just humor, but after conflicts at a birthday party, he decides to break up with his girlfriend, choosing his friends and brother over her.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up. The key points to consider are: \n\n1. The author's actions: He chose to end the relationship because his social circle was racist against his GF. He initially dismissed the racism as jokes but later realized the harm. However, the breakup was a direct result of prioritizing his family and friends over his GF.\n\n2. Responsibility: Even if the author didn't intend to be racist, he didn't actively confront his friends and brother's behavior. Instead, he let it affect his relationship. The fact that he later dates a female friend (who was against the ex) might imply he's shifting focus, but that's not directly relevant here.\n\n3. Ethical perspective: Relationships require support and standing up for each other. By choosing his family over his GF, he failed to protect her from racism. The GF felt isolated and left early. Breaking up because of the family's racism could be seen as wrong, as it's his responsibility to address the racism rather than abandon the GF.\n\n4. Alternatives: The author could have stood up to his family, set boundaries, or tried to mediate. Instead, he gave up when conflicts arose, which might indicate he wasn't committed to making the relationship work despite the challenges.\n\n5. Impact on GF: She was put in a hostile environment multiple times, leading to arguments and her feeling disrespected. The author's decision to break up after the ultimatum suggests he didn't prioritize her well-being enough.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's failure to confront the racism and his decision to end the relationship instead of addressing the root issue likely makes him at fault. He had a duty to support his partner and create an inclusive environment, which he didn't fulfill.\n"
