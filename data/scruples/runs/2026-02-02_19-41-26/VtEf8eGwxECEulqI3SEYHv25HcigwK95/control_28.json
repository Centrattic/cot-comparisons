We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is from Poland, living in Berlin. He dates a woman from Ethiopia. When he introduces her to his friends and family, they aren't welcoming. They use racist jokes and tropes, refuse to speak her languages, and his brother even threatens to tell their parents. The girlfriend is upset, and after another bad party where the racism resurfaces, she leaves. The author then breaks up with her, choosing his friends and family over her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author claims he didn't realize his friends were being racist, just thought they were joking. But the girlfriend felt targeted and marginalized. The author decided to break up because he couldn't choose between his girlfriend and his friends/family. He also mentions that he's now \"dating\" the female friend who was against his ex, which adds a layer of possible bias.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, relationships require mutual respect and support. If the author's social circle is openly racist and it's causing his partner distress, it's his responsibility to support her. Choosing friends who are harmful to his partner's well-being shows a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author should have stood by his girlfriend instead of letting external pressures dictate the relationship's end. The fact that he didn't confront his friends' racism and instead let it lead to a breakup suggests he prioritized his own comfort and social ties over his partner's feelings and the health of their relationship. \n\nEven if he didn't see the racism as intentional, the outcome was harmful. The girlfriend was clearly hurt and called out the racism, which he didn't address effectively. Breaking up because he can't handle the social pressure from his family and friends makes him complicit in the environment that caused the problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not supporting his girlfriend and allowing external influences to end the relationship.\n"
