We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is Polish, living in Berlin. He met his girlfriend at work, who is from Ethiopia. When he introduced her to his friends and family, they were unfriendly, used Polish instead of English or German, and made racist jokes. His brother even threatened to tell their parents he's dating a non-Christian. After a bad birthday party where tensions exploded, the author chose to break up with her, prioritizing his family and friends over the relationship. He's now dating a female friend who was against the ex.\n\nSo, the key points here are that the author's circle was being openly racist, and he broke up with his girlfriend to avoid conflict. But he's wondering if he was in the wrong. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author's friends and family were clearly being racist, which is wrong. But on the other hand, he chose to break up with his girlfriend instead of standing by her. That could be seen as taking the side of his friends and family's racism over his partner. \n\nIn relationships, supporting your partner against discrimination is crucial. Choosing family over a partner in such a situation can be seen as a betrayal. However, the author might feel he was caught between two groups and couldn't handle the pressure. But the fact that he's now dating the friend who was against his ex might add to the perception that he was complicit in the racism, or at least not actively opposing it.\n\nAlso, the author mentions he tried to explain the situation to his girlfriend, but she left early. Then he tried to convince her it would be okay to socialize with his friends again, but that also failed. The breakup was mutual, but he's the one who gave in to his brother's pressure. \n\nIn many cases, supporting your partner when they face discrimination from your family and friends is expected. Choosing to abandon the partner in favor of the discriminatory group could be seen as being in the wrong, even if the pressure was intense. The author might not have actively supported the racism, but by not standing up for his girlfriend and leaving the relationship, he might be complicit in enabling the racist environment.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he prioritized his racist friends and family over his girlfriend, allowing their behavior to dictate the end of the relationship instead of taking a stand against the racism.\n"
