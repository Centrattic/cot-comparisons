We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe user is Polish, living in Berlin. He met his girlfriend at a caf\u00e9 where he works, and they started dating. When he introduced her to his friends and family, they were not friendly. They spoke only Polish, making it hard for her to communicate. His brother even asked why he's dating a Black person and mentioned calling their parents to say she's not a Christian. The girlfriend was upset and left early. Later, at a birthday party, there was another conflict where friends made racist jokes, leading to the GF having a scene and leaving. The author then broke up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her.\n\nThe user is asking if he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications. Choosing family and friends over a partner in a situation where the family is being racist is problematic. The girlfriend was being discriminated against by the author's close circle. The author initially thought the racism was just jokes but realized it was serious when it affected his relationship. By breaking up, he prioritized his social group over standing up for his partner. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was understandable given the treatment. The author's brother even threatened to tell their parents, which adds to the pressure. The author's friends made jokes and refused to communicate in her language. The author claims he tried to mediate, but the situation escalated. \n\nThe key point is whether the author should have supported his girlfriend against the racism or chosen to stay with his friends. In many ethical frameworks, supporting your partner against discrimination is important. Choosing family over a partner in such a case can be seen as a betrayal of the partner. \n\nHowever, the author might feel torn between two important relationships. But the fact that the friends and family were the source of the problem makes it a difficult choice. Still, the author's decision to break up suggests he valued his existing relationships over his commitment to his girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's anger and the fact that she called him a weakling indicate that she felt betrayed. The author's friends also started dating a female friend, which might have influenced his decision, but that's a separate issue. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author was in a tough spot, the racial discrimination from his side's friends and family is a serious issue. Choosing to side with the racists rather than supporting his girlfriend means he was in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
