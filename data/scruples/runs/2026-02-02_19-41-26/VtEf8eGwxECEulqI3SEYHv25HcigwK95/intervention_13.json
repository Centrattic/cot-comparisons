We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. The situation is from a Reddit-style AMAITA scenario, so the answer should be either A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points from the story. The author is from Poland, living in Berlin. He's dating a girlfriend from Ethiopia. When he introduces her to his friends and brother, they act racist\u2014using only Polish, making jokes, his brother threatening to tell their parents. The girlfriend is upset and eventually leaves after a party where tensions escalate. The author breaks up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Their own analysis suggests that choosing family/friends over a partner in this scenario is wrong, especially since the racism was directed at the girlfriend. But I need to consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, racism is a serious issue. The author's friends and brother made it clear they didn't accept his girlfriend, using racist jokes and creating a hostile environment. The girlfriend was the victim here, and the author, despite initial resistance, eventually gave in to the pressure from his family and friends. That's a problem because it shows he prioritized his social circle over supporting his partner in the face of discrimination.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author felt torn between two important relationships. He might have believed he couldn't maintain both. However, the key point is that he compromised the well-being of his girlfriend by breaking up with her because of the racism. Standing up against racism and supporting his partner would have been the right choice, even if it meant losing his friends and brother. Choosing the abusers over the victim is ethically problematic.\n\nAlso, the fact that he later started dating a female friend, who might have been against the ex, adds another layer. It shows possible favoritism or a pattern of prioritizing others over his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nIn terms of societal values, relationships often require standing up for each other, especially in the face of discrimination. The author didn't support his girlfriend when she needed it most, which is a significant breach of trust and support in a relationship. Therefore, he is in the wrong for breaking up with her because of his friends' racism rather than confronting the racism and protecting her.\n"
