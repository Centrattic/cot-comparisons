We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend because their friends and family were racist towards her. The boyfriend is Polish, the girlfriend is Ethiopian. The friends and family made racist jokes, didn't speak English or German at the party, and the brother even threatened to tell their parents about the girlfriend's religion. The girlfriend felt excluded and eventually left in an argument. The author then broke up with her to keep his relationship with his friends and brother.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to prioritize his family and friends over his girlfriend. From what I understand, racism is a serious issue. The girlfriend was being discriminated against by his close circle, and the author didn't stand up for her. Even though he thought the jokes were just \"friendly\" at first, he later realized they were hurtful. The girlfriend tried to handle it but eventually couldn't take it anymore. The author's decision to break up seems to be because he couldn't choose between his partner and his family/friends, which led to the ultimatum. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other through challenges is important. If the partner is facing discrimination, the partner should stand by them, not leave because of the family's disapproval. The author's friends and family were actively making the girlfriend feel unwelcome, which is a red flag. The author might have been aware of the racism but didn't take it seriously until the conflict escalated. The fact that he ended up dating a female friend who was against his ex might indicate that he's still influenced by his circle's racism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that his brother helped him financially and that he couldn't lose them. But that doesn't excuse the racist behavior. True friends and family should support someone's choices, even if they disagree. The author's choice to prioritize his friends over his girlfriend's well-being seems to show a lack of commitment and support. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend was the one who faced the discrimination, and the author's inaction or hesitation to protect her could be seen as complicity. Even if the author wasn't overtly racist, by not confronting his friends and brother, he allowed the racism to happen. Breaking up because of that might be a way to avoid conflict but doesn't address the root issue. So, it's possible that the author is in the wrong because he didn't stand up for his partner and let his family's racism influence his decision.\n"
