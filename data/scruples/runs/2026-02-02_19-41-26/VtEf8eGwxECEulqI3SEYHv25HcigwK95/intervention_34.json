We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because his friends and family were racist towards her. The girlfriend is Ethiopian, and the friends mainly spoke Polish, made racist jokes, and during a party, things escalated into arguments. The author ended up choosing his friends and brother over the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The girlfriend was being discriminated against, which is a serious issue. The author's friends and family were making racist jokes and not making her feel welcome. The author tried to explain it as a joke, but that's not an excuse for racism. When his girlfriend confronted the issue, the author didn't support her, and instead, his brother even threatened to tell their parents. That's pretty harsh.\n\nThe author then had a birthday party where things went bad again. The girlfriend left in a huff, and after that, the brother pressured him to break up. The author did so, saying it wasn't working out. The girlfriend was clearly hurt and angry. Now, the author is questioning if he was in the wrong. He mentions he might be dating a female friend now, which complicates things because that friend was against the ex.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual respect and support. If the partner is being discriminated against, the partner should stand up for them. By not standing by his girlfriend and choosing his friends, the author didn't support her in her time of need. Even if he thought the racism was just joking, he should have addressed it. The fact that he ended the relationship because of his friends' racism suggests he prioritized their approval over his girlfriend's well-being. That's a red flag. Also, the girlfriend's anger and the way he broke up with her might show a lack of empathy. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for not supporting his girlfriend against racism and making her choose between them.\n"
