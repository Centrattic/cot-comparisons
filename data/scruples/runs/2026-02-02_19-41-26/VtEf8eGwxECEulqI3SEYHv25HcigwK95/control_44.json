We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. The situation is that the girlfriend is Ethiopian, and the author's friends and brother made racist jokes and weren't accepting of her. The author tried to introduce her, but the friends used Polish and didn't communicate with her. The brother even threatened to tell their parents. After a bad party where things escalated, the author broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical aspects here. The author's main conflict is between his partner and his family/friends. The question is whether he made the right choice in prioritizing his family and friends over his girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend was clearly treated poorly by the author's circle. The author might have thought it was just joking, but the actions of his friends and brother were racist. The girlfriend felt isolated and the situation led to the breakup. The author later started dating a female friend who was against the ex, which might indicate some bias.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author should have supported his girlfriend instead of choosing his family. Breaking up because of others' racism could be seen as enabling their behavior. The author didn't stand up against the racism, which is a problem. Even though he felt pressured by his brother and friends, he should have chosen to support his partner. The girlfriend was the victim here, and the author's decision to leave her might be seen as wrong because he didn't confront the racism in his circle. \n\nHowever, maybe the author felt he couldn't handle the pressure and needed to maintain his support network. But in that case, he might still be in the wrong because he didn't try to address the racism or support his girlfriend. The key point is whether he took responsibility. Since he didn't, the answer is likely A.\n"
