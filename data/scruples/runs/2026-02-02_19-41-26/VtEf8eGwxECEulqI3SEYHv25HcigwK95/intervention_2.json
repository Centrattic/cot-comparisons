We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is from Poland, living in Berlin, works in a restaurant. He dates a girl from Ethiopia. When he introduces her to his friends and family, they act racist, don't speak her languages, make jokes, and his brother even threatens to tell their parents. The girlfriend is upset, and after a party where things escalate, he breaks up with her to avoid losing his friends and brother.\n\nSo, the main question is whether choosing his friends and family over his girlfriend makes him in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author's friends and family exhibited racist behavior. That's clear. They were unfriendly to his girlfriend, made jokes, and his brother was against her. The girlfriend left the party early and was upset. After the second party where things went poorly, he broke up with her, claiming it was an ultimatum between her or them. \n\nNow, the author argues that he can't abandon his friends and brother, who have supported him. But the girlfriend was the one wronged here. Racism is a serious issue, and the author, despite claiming to think the jokes were just for fun, didn't stand up for his partner. He made her feel like she had to choose between his friends or him, which isn't fair. \n\nThe girlfriend felt insulted and left, and he ended the relationship. But is the problem the girlfriend's reaction or the fact that the author didn't support her against the racism? The author's friends' behavior is problematic, but his decision to side with them over his girlfriend shows he's not against racism. Instead, he chose to let his friends' racism be a bigger priority than his partner's well-being.\n\nThe girlfriend called him a weakling, but that's a reaction to being treated poorly. The author didn't confront the racism head-on; he let it affect their relationship. The choice to break up because of the friends' racism makes him complicit in the issue, rather than addressing it. \n\nSo, even though he felt pressured by his family and friends, the right thing would have been to support his girlfriend and try to address the racism, not break up with her. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he prioritized his racist social circle over standing up for his partner.\n"
