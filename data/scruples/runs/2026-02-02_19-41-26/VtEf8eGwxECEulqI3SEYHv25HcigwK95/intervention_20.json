We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist is in the wrong. I need to figure out if he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed Reddit-style story. The guy is from Poland but in Berlin. He met his girlfriend at work, she's from Ethiopia. When he introduced her to his friends and family, they weren't friendly\u2014using Polish, making racist jokes, and his brother even threatened to tell their parents. The girlfriend was upset, and after a birthday party that turned into a mess with more jokes and arguments, he ended up breaking up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to know what I think. The answer should be A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nSo, let's break it down. The key points here are about racism and the decision to prioritize family/friends over a partner. The girlfriend faced racism from the group, and when confronted, the author tried to downplay it as jokes. Even after the girlfriend was upset, he tried to convince her to stay, then broke up with her to keep his social circle. \n\nRacism is a serious issue. Choosing to stay with friends who are racist rather than supporting a partner who is being discriminated against can be seen as complicit in the racism. The author's friends and brother made it clear they were uncomfortable with his relationship, using racist language and jokes. The author might have thought it was just humor, but the impact on the girlfriend was clear\u2014she felt excluded and targeted. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other against discrimination is important. The author's decision to break up because his friends and family didn't accept the girlfriend's race is a clear case of prioritizing his social group over his partner in the face of racism. The girlfriend was right to feel wronged, and the author's actions show that he valued his existing relationships over standing up for his partner. \n\nThe author might argue that he's just trying to maintain his support network, but in doing so, he allowed the racist behavior to continue. Choosing to end the relationship because of others' racism is a form of enabling their bigoted attitudes. Even if the author didn't realize the severity of the racism at first, his continued association with those people after being made aware of their behavior contributes to the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author wasn't directly racist and was caught between conflicting loyalties. However, in cases of racism, neutrality isn't a neutral ground\u2014it often sides with the oppressor. The author's actions of not confronting his friends and family, despite knowing their stance, led to the breakup. That makes him complicit. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for not standing by his partner against racism and for allowing his friends and family's bigotry to dictate the outcome of his relationship. The answer should be A.\n"
