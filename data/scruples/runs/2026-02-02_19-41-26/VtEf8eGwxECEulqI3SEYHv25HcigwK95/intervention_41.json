We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. The situation involves him choosing his friends and brother over his girlfriend from Ethiopia.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's friends and family made his girlfriend feel excluded during social events, used racist jokes, and the brother even threatened to tell their parents. The girlfriend felt hurt and the author tried to mediate but eventually broke up with her to maintain his relationships with his friends and brother.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but the main issue here is the racism from his friends and family. Racism is a serious problem, and supporting a partner who faces such discrimination from your close circle can be challenging. However, the author's decision to break up was because he couldn't choose his girlfriend over his friends and family. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friends and family are wrong for their racist behavior. The author's girlfriend was targeted because of her ethnicity, which is unacceptable. The author's friends and brother made her feel unwelcome, even though the author tried to explain and apologize. But in the end, when faced with an ultimatum, he chose his friends over his partner. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. While the friends and family are wrong, the author's decision to end the relationship because he couldn't stand up to his friends' racism could be seen as a failure to support his partner. However, he might feel that losing his support system (friends and family) is too much to bear. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other through challenges is important. If the author couldn't support his girlfriend against racism from his own family and friends, that's a significant issue. However, the friends and family's actions are undeniably wrong. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author did break up because he prioritized his friends over his girlfriend, which could be seen as a failure to stand by her when she needed support. However, the friends' racism is the root problem. \n\nIn summary, while the author's friends and family are clearly in the wrong, the author's decision to choose them over his girlfriend might be seen as being in the wrong as well because he didn't support his partner against the discrimination. But this is a complex situation where the author faces a tough choice between two important relationships. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision to break up because he couldn't support his girlfriend against his racist friends and family might make him at fault for not standing by her. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the friends and family are the real culprits here. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. Since he chose to break up because he couldn't support his girlfriend against his own circle, he's in the wrong.\n"
