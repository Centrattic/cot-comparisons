We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist. So, the main issue here is whether choosing to side with his racist friends and brother over his girlfriend was the right decision.\n\nFirst, the guy is from Poland, living in Berlin, works in a restaurant, and starts dating a girlfriend from Ethiopia. When he tries to introduce her to his friends, they act unfriendly, only speak Polish, and make racist jokes. The brother even mentions calling the parents to say he's dating a non-Christian. The girl gets upset because she can't communicate and feels excluded. Later, at a party, things escalate with more jokes and arguments. The girlfriend leaves in a huff, and after the brother pressures him, he breaks up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her.\n\nNow, the key points here are about racism and loyalty. The author's friends and family are being racist, which is clearly wrong. The author claims he thought the jokes were just humor, but when the situation actually affects his relationship, he realizes the harm but still sides with his friends. Choosing to break up with his girlfriend because his family and friends are racist implies that he prioritizes his relationships with them over standing up against racism. That's a problem because supporting racism, even if it's through inaction, is complicity. By not confronting his friends and brother, he's allowing their behavior to drive the decision to end the relationship, which is a form of enabling their racism. The girlfriend clearly felt disrespected and excluded, and the author didn't take a stand to protect her feelings or their relationship. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he later dates a female friend who was against the ex, suggesting possible favoritism or inconsistency. But the main issue is the initial decision to break up based on the racist behavior. In a healthy relationship, mutual respect and support are crucial. If the author's social circle is so toxic that they can't accept his partner's background, it's a sign that those relationships might be harmful. The author is in the wrong because he allowed racism to dictate the end of his relationship instead of addressing the root issue and standing up for his partner. Choosing friends and family over a romantic partner in the face of racism is a clear indication of where the author's true loyalties lie, and that's problematic.\n"
