We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is from Poland, living in Berlin. He's dating a girl from Ethiopia. He introduces her to his friends and family, but they act racist. His brother even comments on why he's dating a \"non-Christian,\" and there's a bunch of racist jokes and not speaking English or German so she can't communicate. Then, after a birthday party where things go badly, he breaks up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points are that the author's friends and family were being racist. The author claims he didn't take it seriously at first, thinking it was a joke. But when presented with the reality (the girlfriend being upset), he tried to downplay it. Then, when the girlfriend confronts the racism at the party, he breaks up with her, choosing his friends and brother over her.\n\nSo, the author is in a situation where he's choosing between his partner and his family/friends. The main issue here is whether he's in the wrong for prioritizing his family over his girlfriend when they were being racist.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting family members who are racist could be seen as wrong. The author's friends and brother were making racist jokes and being exclusionary. The girlfriend was directly targeted, which led to the conflict. The author's decision to break up because he couldn't abandon his friends and brother suggests that he valued his relationships with them over standing up for his partner against racism.\n\nEven if the author didn't intend for the racism to go too far, once it became clear that it was causing harm, his choice to side with the family and friends indicates complicity. By breaking up due to the ultimatum, he's effectively accepting their behavior because he can't confront it, which is a problem.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that after the breakup, he started dating a female friend who was against the ex. This might indicate some bias or favoritism in his decisions, which could affect his judgment in the situation.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if someone is in a relationship with a person of color and their family/friends are being racist, the partner should support the affected individual. Choosing to leave the relationship to stay with family who are being racist can be seen as a failure to take a stand against racism. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not supporting his girlfriend and instead choosing his family's acceptance over her well-being.\n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
