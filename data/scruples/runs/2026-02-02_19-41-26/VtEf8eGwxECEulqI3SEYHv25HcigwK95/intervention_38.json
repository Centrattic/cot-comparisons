We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend because his friends and family are racist is in the wrong. The scenario is from AITA (Am I the Asshole) and the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy is from Poland, works/studies in Berlin. He starts dating a girlfriend from Ethiopia. When he introduces her to his friends and family, they act racist\u2014using Polish among themselves, making racist jokes, the brother even mentions telling parents he's dating a non-Christian. The girlfriend is upset, there's a party where things escalate, she leaves, and the guy eventually breaks up, choosing his family/friends over her. He now dates a female friend, possibly why she was against the ex.\n\nThe user argues the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nIn relationships, supporting your partner against discrimination is crucial. The author's friends and family showed clear racism, and the girlfriend felt alienated. By not standing up for her, the author failed to support her, leading to the breakup. However, he's also in a situation where his support system is his family/friends. Choosing between them and his partner is a tough spot, but prioritizing the partner's well-being is usually expected. \n\nThe brother's comment about non-Christian and wanting to inform parents is a red flag. The author's friends made excuses for racism, using humor as a cover. The girlfriend was clearly wronged. The author's decision to break up might have been a result of pressure from his family, which could indicate he's avoiding conflict but not necessarily wrong. However, in modern contexts, standing by a partner against racism is expected, so the author's choice to prioritize family might be seen as the wrong decision. \n\nBut the girlfriend called him names and accused him of being weak. That complicates things. However, the root issue is the systemic racism from his side. The girlfriend's anger is a response to the racism, which is valid. The author's friends and family are the source of the problem. The author's decision to leave the relationship because of the conflict might be a way to avoid responsibility, but he's also in a difficult situation. \n\nIn AITA contexts, people are often criticized for not supporting their partners in such cases. The author's friends and family are the ones at fault for the racism, but the author is being held accountable for not defending his partner. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't stand up for his girlfriend against the racism, choosing instead to break up to keep his family/friends. But the user already thinks that, so I need to confirm if that's correct.\n"
