We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend because their friends and family were being racist towards her. The girlfriend is from Ethiopia, and the author's friends and brother made racist jokes and were unfriendly. The author tried to introduce the girlfriend to their group, but things went poorly. Eventually, the author chose to side with their friends and brother over the girlfriend and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue. The author's friends and family engaging in racist behavior is clearly wrong. The author might have justified their actions by saying they couldn't lose their friends and family, but the girlfriend was the victim of that racism. When someone is subjected to racism, especially from their partner's close circle, it creates a toxic environment. The partner is supposed to be a support system, but the author's group was actively harmful.\n\nThe author claims they thought the racist behavior was just jokes. However, the girlfriend was directly affected, and the jokes were not acceptable. The author's brother even threatened to tell their parents about the girlfriend's religion, which is another form of prejudice. Even if the author didn't realize the severity initially, the continued behavior and the girlfriend's distress show that the environment wasn't safe for her.\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other against external negativity is important. The girlfriend felt that the author wasn't standing up for her. The author chose to prioritize their social network over their partner's well-being. Breaking up might have been a way to avoid conflict, but it's also a failure to confront the racism in their own circle.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was in a difficult position, pressured by their family and friends. But the responsibility of the author is to support their partner, not to choose between them and their family. The author's decision to break up because their family was racist is essentially condoning that racism, which is problematic.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they didn't address the racism and instead allowed it to dictate the end of the relationship. The girlfriend's experience of racism was real and harmful, and the author didn't protect her from that. The answer is A.\n"
