We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is from Poland, living in Berlin, and broke up with his Ethiopian girlfriend because his friends and family were racist. He tried to introduce her, but the friends were unfriendly, using Polish instead of English or German, making racist jokes. The brother even threatened to tell the parents about dating a non-Christian. The girlfriend was upset and the author eventually broke up with her to keep his friends and brother. Now he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the author's decision to choose his friends and family over his girlfriend due to their racism. The girlfriend wasn't the problem; it was the friends and brother's behavior. The author claims he thought the jokes were just jokes and didn't realize the depth of their racism until it escalated. However, when his girlfriend confronted the issue, he didn't stand up for her or address the racism directly. Instead, he broke up with her to avoid conflict with his friends and brother.\n\nThe author's friends and family are exhibiting racist behavior, which is a serious issue. The girlfriend was a victim of this racism, and the author's inaction in supporting her is problematic. By breaking up with her to maintain relationships with the racist friends and brother, the author is complicit in allowing that racism to continue. He didn't try to change their behavior or create boundaries to protect his girlfriend. Instead, he prioritized his own comfort and his friends' acceptance over standing with his girlfriend against racism.\n\nThe author's justification that he can't \"abandon\" his friends and brother because they've been there for him since childhood doesn't excuse his decision. Standing against racism is a moral obligation, and it's not about abandoning people but confronting harmful behavior. The fact that he's now \"dating\" the female friend who was against the ex suggests he might be trying to find validation from the same group that was racist, which further indicates he's not taking responsibility for his actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because he chose to support the racist environment created by his friends and family over standing with his girlfriend. He failed to address the racism and instead prioritized his own social group's approval, which is a clear moral failing.\n"
