We were quite a close group but recently i started new job in restaurant as i do want to became a chef one day so we were meeting each other less often as they tend to stick in their dormitory most of the times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell long story short i met a girl in my new workplace (hipster-ish caf\u00e9) and after some time we started dating. I was really gladfull for some company as i was mostly alone or just chatting with friends. Everything seems fine but then i wanted to introduce my new GF to friends and problems started. We threw a small party in pub but my friends were not really friendly towards her, most of the time they refused to speak german or english and stick to polish so only person she was able to talk was myself. I did not know what was going on, she left early but i stayed as it was quite some time i saw my old buddies. Well, almost immediately she left my brother asked my, straightforwardly, why am i dating black person. You see, GF is from Ethiopia which i did not saw as a problem (as it is not a problem in normal sociaty i guess). \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean, we always ran racist jokes and tropes and stuff like that but i honestly always thought it is joke, not something taken seriously. Our former manager was from turkey so i did not knew they will seriously take this as an issue. My brother and one girl from our group were the worst in this - my brother even told me he will call our parents and tell them iam dating non-christian girl (although SHE IS non-catholic christian, but explain difference to parents...). Initially i told them to fuck off and left place (as we were all little bit drunk i still considered that nothing more than \"friendly\" joking).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell afterwards i told my GF what was that all about, why did not they talk to her and she was pissed and told me i dont need them and they are assholes (true, i guess). Things went back to semi-normal, i kept chatting with friends (they were still making fun of me for dating her but in a way friendlier way) and hanging out with her but then i had my birthday party and naturally i wanted to celebrate with both my friends and brother, and her. I convinced her it will be okay, that they indeed are assholes but not a real racist people and they just have this kind of humour.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs you can expect it did not go well. It did not take long to arguments starting but this time she was more aggressive - calling out their lack of education, making polish jokes about plumbers, etc. Truth be told i think it was my female friend who started that with some stupid monkey-related joke but then it was all in from all parties involved. In the end she made a scene, called herself an uber and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nParty ruined, i felt like shit and brother started to convince me to break up with her. So i did that. Next day we met and i told her we need to break up because this is not working for us. She called me names, specifically stating iam weakling and i should ho fuck myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo - i know iam asshole in many ways and she was the wronged party but i really cannot \"abandon\" all my friends. We were together since childhood, my brother looked up for me since i remember and i was never really able to go againts him. I would never be able to study and work here without them and they, mainly my brother, helped me multiple times when i had struggled with money or anything else.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo AITA for breaking up with here since it was basically ultimatum her or them? Or was it only viable solution?\n\nIt was not going to work and i really dont want to loose everyone i know since child. Since then iam kinda (not really \"serious\") dating that female friend, that might be the reason she was so againts my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTl;dr\n\nI break up with GF because she is ethiopian and my friends and brother are racist.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because his friends and family were being racist towards her. The main issue is that the author chose to side with his friends and brother over his girlfriend when there was racism involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspect of the situation. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting friends or family who exhibit racist behavior can be problematic. The author mentions that his friends and brother made jokes and were unfriendly towards his girlfriend, especially because she was Ethiopian. He initially thought it was just joking around, but the girlfriend clearly felt hurt and uncomfortable.\n\nThe key point here is the ultimatum: the author had to choose between his girlfriend and his friends/family. By breaking up with his girlfriend, he prioritized maintaining relationships with people who were being racist. Even if he felt pressure from his brother and friends, supporting racist behavior is a red flag in any relationship. The girlfriend decided that she couldn't continue in a relationship where her partner's close circle was treating her poorly because of her race.\n\nAnother angle is the author's responsibility. Even if he didn't realize the extent of the racism at first, he should have taken the girlfriend's feelings seriously when she expressed her discomfort. The fact that his brother even threatened to call their parents about her religion shows a level of intolerance. The author's decision to break up with the girlfriend to avoid losing his friends suggests he valued his existing relationships over her well-being and respect for her identity.\n\nAlso, the aftermath where he started dating a female friend who was against the ex might indicate that his motivations weren't entirely pure. It could imply that he was looking for a new partner who would be more aligned with his social circle, further supporting the idea that he prioritized his friends over his girlfriend's needs.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author might have felt torn, choosing to side with the racist friends and family over standing up for his girlfriend places him in the wrong. Supporting racism, even if it's within family or close friends, is ethically incorrect. The author should have tried to address the racism or find a solution that respects his girlfriend's dignity, rather than using her as a sacrifice to maintain toxic relationships.\n"
