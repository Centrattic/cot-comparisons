      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with his ex-girlfriend because of her sexual past.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The couple was together for 8 months without having sex. The breakup happened after the author learned about her past. She had multiple partners in college, up to 15, while he had two. He left her, and she accused him of slut-shaming. His friends also think he was an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about jealousy, past relationships, and the justification for ending a relationship. The author's reason for breaking up is her past, which doesn't involve current behavior but past actions. Since they were in a relationship for 8 months without sex, maybe there were other issues, but he focused on her past. \n\nI should consider if past sexual experiences are a valid reason to end a relationship. Generally, people's pasts can include various experiences, and unless it's causing current issues, it might not be fair to hold it against them. The fact that he broke up because of her past, when they weren't even having sex, might indicate his own insecurity or jealousy. \n\nAlso, the number of partners can be subjective. She estimates 8-15, and he had 2. If he's okay with his own number, why does her higher number matter? It could be a double standard. The term \"slut-shaming\" is used because he's judging her for her past, which is a form of shaming someone for their sexual history. \n\nHis friends agreeing that he was an asshole suggests that his actions might not be socially accepted. The ex's reaction of calling him a slut-shamer makes sense if he's criticizing her for something that's none of his business, especially since they weren't in a sexual relationship. \n\nAnother angle: maybe there's an underlying issue in their relationship. Since they hadn't had sex yet, perhaps there were other problems, but he chose to blame her past instead. That might be a way to avoid addressing mutual issues. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he made a choice to end the relationship based on her past. Unless there was a specific agreement about past relationships, it's his own issue. So, he might be in the wrong for projecting his own standards onto her without discussing it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer seems to be A, that the author is in the wrong because he's holding her past against her without valid reason, leading to slut-shaming and an unfair breakup.\n"
