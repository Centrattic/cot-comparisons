      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend after 8 months because of her sexual past. They never had sex themselves. The girl claims he's slut-shaming her and being an asshole, and some friends agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of slut-shaming. That usually involves judging someone's decisions about their own sexuality, especially in a negative or demeaning way. The author is making a judgment based on the number of past partners the girl had, which could be seen as slut-shaming if he's criticizing her without considering her perspective or consent to those relationships.\n\nThen there's the fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship. That might indicate he had his own standards, but he's choosing to end the relationship based on her past actions. However, if the girl didn't bring up her past and he only found out later, maybe he was holding onto expectations that he didn't communicate clearly. \n\nAlso, the number of past partners can vary a lot. The girl's count is 8 but possibly up to 15. The author has slept with 2 people. So, he's making a decision based on a significant difference in their past experiences, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's justified. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. If he had issues with her past, maybe he should have discussed it sooner. Ending the relationship after 8 months because of her past might come off as unfair, especially if he's not being hypocritical in his current behavior. But the act of judging her past choices and ending the relationship without prior discussion could be seen as holding her to a double standard. \n\nHis friends agreeing that he's in the wrong might suggest that his actions are not socially acceptable. Slut-shaming is generally frowned upon because it promotes judgment and can be harmful. Even if he felt uncomfortable, it's important to address that without making the other person feel ashamed. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because he's making a judgment about her past without clear communication, potentially slut-shaming her, and not respecting her past choices. His own past with two partners doesn't negate her experiences, and the timing of the breakup suggests possible insensitivity.\n"
