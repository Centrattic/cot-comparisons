      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her sexual past.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple was together for 8 months and never had sex. The guy broke up with her because he found out she had slept with multiple people in college (8 to 15 guys), while he had only 2 partners. She accused him of slut-shaming, and his friends support that view.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the breakup reason is based on her past sexual behavior, not her current actions. They weren't sexually active during their relationship. The guy's reaction is based on her history, which he learned about after 8 months. The question is whether that makes him the asshole.\n\nI should consider societal norms and personal ethics. In many modern perspectives, people's past sexual relationships are their own business, especially if they're not currently affecting the relationship. The guy's judgment of her past could be seen as hypocritical, especially since he has a history himself (2 partners). Also, slut-shaming is generally frowned upon because it's a judgment of someone's sexual history, which is often considered personal and not a valid reason for a breakup unless there are specific issues like cheating or dishonesty in the current relationship.\n\nThe fact that they never had sex during their 8-month relationship is important. It might indicate that the guy had his own boundaries or preferences, but bringing up her past when they weren't even having sex could be seen as unfair. His friends agreeing with her suggests that others see it as hypocritical or judgmental.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is in the wrong (A) because he's judging her past, which isn't relevant if she's honest and not currently engaging in behavior that affects their relationship. The answer is A.\n"
