      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her sexual past. The situation is that they were together for 8 months without having sex, and he found out she had multiple partners in college. He ended the relationship, and some friends and the ex think he's an asshole for it. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man broke up because of her past, which some might see as slut-shaming. But why was he okay with being with her for 8 months without sex? That might indicate he had some personal boundaries or reasons for not having sex yet. However, the fact that he later broke up over her past could be hypocritical if he was okay with their current relationship but not her history.\n\nSlut-shaming is generally frowned upon because someone's past sexual experiences don't affect current compatibility unless there's specific issues like STIs or trust concerns. But the key here is that he didn't have any issues during their 8 months together. Maybe he was okay with her past but only found out later and then decided to break up. That could be seen as using her past as a reason after the fact, especially if he was fine with being in a relationship where they didn't have sex. \n\nAlso, his friends and the ex think he's an asshole. That suggests that others don't see his reasoning as valid. People often don't look favorably on ending a relationship over something that was in the past and not relevant to the current relationship. Unless there were specific issues, like him not being okay with her having multiple partners, but he didn't address that earlier. \n\nAnother angle: if he had values that he didn't communicate upfront, like being against premarital sex or wanting exclusivity from the start, but he didn't mention it before the relationship. If he waited 8 months to bring up her past, it's probably his own insecurities or judgment that led to the breakup, which is unfair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's making a judgment based on her past, which isn't a valid reason for a breakup in a healthy relationship. The fact that he didn't have sex with her during their relationship might indicate he had his own issues, and using her past as an excuse shows hypocrisy. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
