By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her sexual past. They were together for 8 months without having sex, and the breakup happened after he found out she had multiple partners in college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is ending a relationship based on his girlfriend's past sexual experiences. That's a sensitive topic. Jealousy or insecurity might be factors here. The key point is whether his actions are justified or if it's an example of slut-shaming. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves judging someone, usually a woman, for their sexual behavior. The fact that the author is focusing on her past while he has only had two partners might indicate double standards. The girlfriend didn't do anything during their relationship that he's upset about; it's her past. That could be seen as holding her accountable for things that don't affect their current relationship. \n\nAlso, the friends called him an asshole, which might suggest that society generally disapproves of such actions. However, personal beliefs and values play a role here. If the author had different expectations, maybe he felt uncomfortable, but it's important to communicate that before the breakup. Ending the relationship just because of her past without addressing if it's a problem for the current relationship could be seen as unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author's values are such that he can't be in a relationship with someone with a different sexual history, it's his right to choose. But the way he handled it, without considering her perspective or addressing it through open communication, might be where the issue lies. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's judging her past and using that as a reason to end the relationship, which could be seen as slut-shaming and not respecting her autonomy or their current relationship dynamics."
