      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who left his girlfriend because of her sexual past is in the wrong. The question is AITA (Am I the Asshole), and I need to determine if the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple was together for 8 months without having sex. The author broke up after learning about her past, where she had multiple partners (8 to 15). He had only two. His ex accused him of slut-shaming and being an asshole, and some friends agree. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the key issues here are: Is it fair to break up based on someone's past sexual history? Does that constitute slut-shaming? And is the author being unreasonable?\n\nIn many modern perspectives, people's past relationships or sexual history are considered personal and not a reason to judge them in a current relationship. Unless there's a specific reason (like STIs or something that affects the current relationship), past actions shouldn't matter if the person is being truthful now. The fact that they hadn't had sex yet suggests maybe there were other issues, but the break up was based on her past, which is not the current partner's business in a healthy relationship. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone judges another for their sexual behavior, often in a way that's derogatory or discriminatory. The author is judging her past, which could be seen as slut-shaming. The number of partners is subjective; what's considered a lot for one person might not be for another. The important thing is the current relationship dynamics. \n\nAlso, the author's own past (2 partners) is less than hers, but that's not the point. What's important is whether the past impacts the current relationship. If she's honest and not hiding anything, then the past shouldn't be a dealbreaker. The author might have personal issues or double standards here. \n\nHis friends calling him an asshole and slut-shaming suggests others see his actions as inappropriate. The ex's reaction is also valid if she felt judged for her past. So, in this case, the author is likely in the wrong for using her past as a reason to end the relationship without valid current reasons. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
