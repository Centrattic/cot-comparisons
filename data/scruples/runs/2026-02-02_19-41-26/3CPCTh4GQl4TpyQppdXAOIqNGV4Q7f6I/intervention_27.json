By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for leaving their girlfriend after 8 months because of her sexual past. They never had sex themselves, and they found out she had a lot of partners in college, maybe 8 to 15. The ex says he was slut-shaming and being an asshole, and some friends agree.\n\nHmm. First, communication in relationships is key. If the author had a problem with her past, did they talk about it before? It seems like they broke up after learning about it, which might mean they didn't address it earlier. Maybe they were okay with her past at first but then changed their mind? Or maybe they had expectations about their relationship being exclusive and abstinence, but that wasn't discussed.\n\nAlso, the fact that they never had sex in 8 months is interesting. Maybe there were issues about readiness or differing expectations even in the current relationship. If the author is asexual or has different values about premarital sex, that's one thing, but if they were leading the relationship on without addressing their own boundaries, that could be a problem. \n\nSlut-shaming is definitely a negative thing. If the author is judging her past without considering her current behavior, that's unfair. The number of partners might not matter if she's been faithful in the current relationship. The author's own experience (only 2 partners) might indicate their own standards, but it's not necessarily right or wrong. However, making a decision to break up based solely on her past could be seen as holding onto outdated or unrealistic beliefs about purity, which is where the friends might be coming from.\n\nAnother angle: relationships are about mutual respect and understanding. If the author couldn't accept her past, maybe that's a personal issue rather than a deal-breaker. Everyone has a different background, and unless there's something specific in her past that's affecting the current relationship, it's not their place to judge. The ex's reaction is valid because the author is applying double standards\u2014judging her for things he wouldn't do but also not engaging in sex himself. Friends agreeing with the ex likely see the hypocrisy here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they broke up over something that doesn't impact their current relationship, potentially for no good reason, and they might be being hypocritical given their own history. The answer should be A.\n"
