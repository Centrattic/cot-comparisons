      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for leaving their girlfriend because of her sexual past. The AITA question here is about whether the decision to break up was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was together for 8 months without having sex. The man broke up because he found out about her past, where she had multiple partners (8 to 15). He's now being called a sluttish and an asshole by friends and his ex. \n\nThe key points here are the man's reasons for the breakup. If he's judging her based on her past sexual behavior, that's typically considered slut shaming. Slut shaming is when someone is criticized or judged for their sexual behavior, especially if it's used to belittle or control them. \n\nSince they never had sex themselves, his issue isn't about betrayal or current actions but her past. That suggests it's more about his own values or discomfort with her history. If he wasn't okay with her past, maybe that should have come up earlier. Ending the relationship based on her past without addressing it sooner could be seen as unfair, especially if he's not holding himself to the same standard (he's had 2 partners). \n\nAlso, the fact that his friends are criticizing him implies that this might be a common view that people don't find his reasoning valid. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if this was a dealbreaker for him, he's allowed to make that choice. But in most relationships, judging a partner for their past without a valid reason (like infidelity in the current relationship) is usually frowned upon. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's judging her past, which is a personal choice and not relevant to their current relationship. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong)."
