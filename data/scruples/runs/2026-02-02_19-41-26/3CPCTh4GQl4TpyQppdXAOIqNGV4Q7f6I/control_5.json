By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her past sexual relationships is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a relationship for 8 months without having sex. The guy ends it because he found out she had a lot of past partners. She says he's slut-shaming her, and some friends agree. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nHmm. Well, slut-shaming is definitely a big issue. Judging someone's past sexual behavior, especially when it's not affecting the current relationship, is generally frowned upon. The guy's reasoning is that her past led to the breakup, but if they didn't have sex themselves, maybe his insecurities or personal values are the real issue. Also, the number of past partners isn't necessarily relevant if there's no current infidelity. The fact that he didn't have sex with her yet might mean he's projecting his own standards without discussing them beforehand. Communication is key in relationships. If he had issues with her past, he should have addressed it earlier. Ending the relationship over something that doesn't impact their current relationship could be seen as unfair. Plus, the fact that his friends call him an asshole suggests that his actions might not be socially accepted. So, I think the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
