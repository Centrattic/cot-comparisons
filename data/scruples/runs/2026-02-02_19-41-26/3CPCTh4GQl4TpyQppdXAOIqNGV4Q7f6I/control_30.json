      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for leaving a girl because of her sexual past. The situation is that they were in a relationship for 8 months without having sex, and the author broke up after finding out about her past with 8 to 15 guys. The author's friends now say they're an asshole, and the ex accuses him of slut shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the author's motivations. They didn't have sex with their ex during the 8 months but broke up because of her past. That's important. It might suggest that the author has personal boundaries or values that the ex didn't meet, but it's also possible that the author is being hypocritical or judgmental.\n\nSlut shaming is a common issue where someone judges another person, especially a woman, for their sexual history. The fact that the author is focusing on her past when they themselves have slept with two people might indicate they are holding her to a different standard. That's a red flag for slut shaming.\n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't have sex in 8 months might point to a personal choice or perhaps a mismatch in expectations. If the author is uncomfortable with her past but is okay with his own, that could be seen as unfair. People's sexual histories are personal, and unless it directly affects the current relationship, it's not a valid reason to end it. The friends agreeing that he's an asshole supports the idea that his actions were wrong, as friends often provide a more balanced perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author had valid reasons. For example, if there's a lack of communication or if there were specific issues related to her past that impacted the relationship. But the way it's presented here, it seems like the break-up was solely based on her past, which is problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're being judgmental about her past without a valid reason, and that's a form of slut shaming. The answer should be A.\n"
