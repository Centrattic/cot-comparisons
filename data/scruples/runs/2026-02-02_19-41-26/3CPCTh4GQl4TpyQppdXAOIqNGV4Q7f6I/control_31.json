      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ended a relationship with his ex because she had slept with multiple guys in college, while he's only slept with two. He's now being called a slut-shamer by his ex and some friends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The relationship lasted 8 months, and they never had sex. The breakup was because of her past. The ex is upset and claims he's shaming her, and friends side with her. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether judging a partner's past sexual behavior is a valid reason to end a relationship and if that constitutes slut-shaming. Let's consider the dynamics. The author is using his partner's past as a reason to end the relationship, which could be seen as holding her to a standard he doesn't hold himself to. Since he's slept with two people and she's slept with more, but he's judging her, that might be hypocritical. \n\nSlut-shaming involves criticizing someone for their sexual behavior, especially if it's done to shame or belittle them. If the author is making a moral judgment about her past, that could fall under that. The fact that they never had sex themselves might indicate that the issue isn't the act itself but the number of partners, which is a subjective matter. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the author had specific concerns about her past, like STIs or emotional issues, that's different. But judging based on the number of partners without a valid reason is problematic. Also, the fact that the ex and friends are calling him out suggests that this is a common issue where people are against shaming others for their sexual history unless there's a mutual agreement on such matters.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a relationship for 8 months without sex, which is unusual. Maybe there were other issues they didn't address, and her past became a convenient reason to break up. The author might be projecting his own insecurities or societal pressures onto her. \n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, slut-shaming is widely considered harmful. It's important to respect a partner's autonomy and past unless it directly affects the current relationship. Since they didn't have sex, maybe the issue is more about his own values conflicting with hers, which is a personal choice but shouldn't be used to shame her. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong for slut-shaming his ex and using her past as the reason to end the relationship without addressing his own biases.\n"
