By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend after finding out she had a lot of sexual partners in the past. They hadn't had sex themselves yet, and he's now being called a slut-shamer by his friends and the ex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: the breakup was based on her past, not her current actions; they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship; he's using that to end the relationship. The question is whether that's justified or not.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, people often have different expectations about past relationships and sexual history. If the guy had issues with her past, maybe that was a personal insecurity or a value clash. But since they hadn't even had sex yet, it's possible he's projecting his own standards onto her without considering mutual respect. Slut-shaming is about making someone feel bad for their sexual activity, which is generally considered harmful. If he's using her past as a reason to end the relationship, even if he's not confronting her about current behavior, it could still be seen as judgmental and disrespectful. \n\nOn the other hand, if the guy had clear boundaries and communicated that his past would affect his ability to be in a relationship, that might be different. But the scenario doesn't mention any prior discussion. It seems like he waited until after 8 months to bring it up, which could be seen as unfair. Also, the number of partners she had is a past matter, and unless there were specific issues like STIs or other current concerns, it's more about her history than their current relationship. \n\nHis friends and the ex calling him out for being an asshole suggests that society generally doesn't support judging someone's past in this way. So, the consensus might lean towards him being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
