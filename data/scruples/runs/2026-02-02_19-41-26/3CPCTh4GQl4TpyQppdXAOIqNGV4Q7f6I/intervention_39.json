We never had sex. Yesterday I broke up with her after learning about her past. She was a bit of a party girl in college and ended up sleeping with a few guys. By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving a girl due to her sexual past. The question is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, so the context is a relationship issue.\n\nThe author was in an 8-month relationship where they didn't have sex. Then they found out the ex had a lot of sexual partners in the past\u20148 to 15, according to her. The author broke up because of that, and now the ex and friends are calling them a slute shamer and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning. The author is using the ex's past sexual behavior as a reason to end the relationship. But since they haven't been sexually active themselves, this seems more about the author's personal values or expectations rather than the ex's current actions. The key issue here is whether past sexual activity is a valid reason to end a relationship, especially when the person hasn't acted on it during the current relationship.\n\nSlut shaming typically involves judging someone for their sexual behavior, often in a derogatory way. However, in this case, the author isn't necessarily shaming her but making a judgment that led to the breakup. The problem is that past relationships or sexual history shouldn't affect the current relationship if both partners are faithful now. The author's decision might stem from personal insecurities, jealousy, or moral beliefs, which can be problematic because it's not about the current relationship's health but the past.\n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't have sex during their 8 months together might indicate different levels of physical intimacy or emotional readiness. The breakup is based on something that happened before they were together, which isn't something the ex can control now. If the author's issue is about her past, that's more about their own inability to accept her history rather than current actions affecting the relationship.\n\nThe ex's reaction and friends' support suggest that the author's actions are seen as unfair or judgmental. The ex might feel that her past is none of his business once they were in a committed relationship. The author's choice to end the relationship over past behavior could be viewed as holding a grudge or being overly critical, which are signs of being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely the asshole here because the breakup is based on the ex's past, which isn't relevant to their current relationship if both are committed now. The right answer should be A.\n"
