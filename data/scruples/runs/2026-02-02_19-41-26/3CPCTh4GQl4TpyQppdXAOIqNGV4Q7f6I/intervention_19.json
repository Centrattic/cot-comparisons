We never had sex. Yesterday I broke up with her after learning about her past. She was a bit of a party girl in college and ended up sleeping with a few guys. By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend after finding out about her past relationships, even though they never had sex themselves. They mention she had between 8 to 15 partners, while the author has only had 2. The ex called them a slut-shamer and an asshole, and some friends agree. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to check.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The breakup is based on the girlfriend's past sexual behavior. Even though they were in a relationship for 8 months and didn't have sex themselves, the decision to end the relationship because of her past is the key point here. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone judges or criticizes a person, especially a woman, for their sexual behavior. If the author is breaking up because of the number of past partners, that could be seen as slut-shaming, especially if the author isn't applying the same standard to themselves or their own history. The author has only had 2 partners, while the ex had more, so the discrepancy might be a red flag. \n\nAlso, in a healthy relationship, being judgmental about a partner's past, especially if it's not relevant to the current relationship, can be problematic. The fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship might indicate issues in their current relationship dynamics. The author's decision to end things because of the past might be more about their own insecurities or prejudices rather than the ex's actions affecting the relationship now.\n\nFriends agreeing that the author is an asshole suggests that the social perspective leans towards the author being in the wrong. The ex's reaction is valid because being judged for past sexual behavior is a form of slut-shaming. The author's actions could be seen as controlling or disrespectful of the ex's autonomy and history. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has the right to set boundaries based on their own values. But if those boundaries are based on judgment rather than mutual respect, it could be problematic. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which often relates to moral or social standards. In most modern contexts, judging someone's past sexual partners is considered unfair and discriminatory, especially when it's not affecting the current relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because their actions constitute slut-shaming and being judgmental about their ex's past, which isn't a valid reason for a breakup if it's not impacting their current relationship. The answer would be A.\n"
