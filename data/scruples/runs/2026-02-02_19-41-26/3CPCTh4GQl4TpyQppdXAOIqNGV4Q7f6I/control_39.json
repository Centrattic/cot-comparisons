      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with someone because of their sexual past.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was in an 8-month relationship where they never had sex. They broke up after finding out the ex had multiple partners in college (8 to 15), while the author has only been with two people. The ex says the author is slut-shaming, and their friends agree. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the reasons for the breakup. The author ended the relationship based on the ex's past sexual behavior. The ex feels this is slut-shaming. Let me think about what slut-shaming means. It's when someone criticizes or judges another person, usually a woman, for their sexual behavior, implying that their actions are wrong or immoral. \n\nThe author didn't have any issue with the current relationship until they found out about the past. Since they didn't have sex during their 8 months together, maybe the issue isn't about current actions but past ones. The author's reasoning might be that they can't accept someone with a lot of past partners. But is that valid?\n\nIn many relationships, people have different levels of comfort regarding their partner's past. Some might care, others not. But if the author is judging the ex for past actions they've already done, especially if those actions don't affect the current relationship, that could be seen as judgmental. The ex is in college, which is a common time for people to explore relationships and sexuality. \n\nThe author's friends are on the ex's side, calling them an asshole. That suggests that society might view this as unfair or hypocritical, especially since the author has also had multiple partners (2), but the number here is the ex's past. The author's issue is not with their current behavior but with past actions. \n\nIs it the author's right to end the relationship for that? Yes, maybe. People have the right to walk away from a relationship if their values or expectations aren't met. However, the way they handled it by calling it a deal-breaker could be seen as wrong, especially if the ex didn't have any current behaviors that the author was uncomfortable with. \n\nBut the author's friends are saying the author is wrong. That might be because they see it as the author being judgmental of the ex's past without valid reasons. Also, the fact that the author wasn't having sex with the ex during the relationship could imply that the author's personal standards or values are the issue here, not the ex's past. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of making a decision to leave, but the motivation and the judgmental attitude could be problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). \n\nI think the correct answer here is A. The author is in the wrong because judging someone's past sexual behavior without valid, relevant reasons can be considered slut-shaming. The ex's past doesn't affect the current relationship's fidelity, so the breakup is based on the author's judgment rather than any current issues. The friends' reactions also support that the author's actions are viewed negatively.\n"
