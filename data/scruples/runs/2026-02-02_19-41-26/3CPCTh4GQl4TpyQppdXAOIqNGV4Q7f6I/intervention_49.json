By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his ex because of her sexual past. The situation is that they were together for 8 months without having sex, and he found out she had a lot of partners in college. He broke up with her, but she and his friends think he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't have any issues with her past until he decided to break up. But why now? Maybe there's an underlying issue. They didn't have sex during their relationship, so maybe he has his own issues or expectations about sex. But he's using her past as a reason. \n\nNow, the key points here: the woman's sexual history is part of her past. If the author is holding that against her now, especially after 8 months of being in a relationship where they didn't even have sex, that could be seen as hypocritical. Because if he's not engaging in sex with her, maybe his own standards are inconsistent. Also, judging someone's past sexual behavior can be considered slut-shaming, which is a form of discrimination against women for their sexual history. That's generally frowned upon because it's a double standard. \n\nThe fact that his friends are saying the same thing she did might indicate that his actions are not socially accepted. The woman's response that he's an asshole could be justified if he's using her past to justify breaking up without addressing his own contributions to the relationship's issues, like not having sex. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's judging her past and using it as a reason to end the relationship, which is a form of slut-shaming and doesn't address the actual issues in their relationship. The correct answer would be A.\n"
