      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend over her past sexual relationships. The user left her after finding out she had slept with 8 to 15 guys in college, while he's only slept with two. She accused him of slut-shaming, and his friends agree he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main issue here is about judgment based on someone's past. The ex-boyfriend ended the relationship because of her sexual history, which is something that happened before they were together. The key question is whether this is a valid reason to break up. \n\nIn most modern perspectives, unless there's an agreement or specific deal-breakers discussed beforehand, judging someone's past is generally seen as unfair. People have the right to their past without being shamed. The fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship might indicate different views on sex, but ending it over her past seems more about his inability to accept her history rather than any current behavior affecting their relationship.\n\nThe friends and the ex's reaction suggest that his actions are considered judgmental and hypocritical, especially since he has his own past. Slut-shaming is typically about shaming someone for their sexual behavior, which he did here. The AITA community usually sides against people who are judgmental without valid reasons. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's being judgmental about her past, which doesn't affect their current relationship, and it's a form of slut-shaming. His friends agreeing he's an asshole supports that view. The key is that people's pasts don't define their worth in a relationship unless there are specific mutual boundaries that were broken.\n"
