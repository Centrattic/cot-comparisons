By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend after finding out she had a lot of sexual partners in the past, even though they were in an 8-month relationship without having sex themselves. The ex claims they were slut-shaming, and friends are on her side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the reasons for the breakup and whether it's justified. The author didn't have sex with the ex during their relationship but ended it upon learning about her past. That seems like a double standard. If the author was okay with having a partner with a sexual history before they were together, but then broke up because of it, that's being hypocritical. Especially since their own history includes two partners, which is fewer than the ex's count but still not zero. \n\nNext, the ex's reaction: she says he's slut-shaming. That term usually refers to judging someone for their sexual behavior, often in a way that's harmful or based on stereotypes. By leaving her solely because of her past, the author is making a judgment about her based on her sexual history, which is a form of slut-shaming. The friends agreeing with her suggests that others see the author's actions as hypocritical or unfair.\n\nAlso, the timing matters. They were in a relationship for 8 months without having sex. That might indicate that the author had certain expectations about the relationship's boundaries, but if the breakup is based on her past rather than any current behavior, it's not about the relationship's terms but about her history. That's usually seen as invalid, because past sexual activity with previous partners is not relevant to a current relationship unless there's an issue like STIs or trust, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is making a judgment about her past, which isn't relevant to their current relationship, especially since he himself has had multiple partners. This is hypocritical and slut-shaming, so he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
