      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they broke up with their ex because the girl had a lot of sexual partners in college, and now their friends and the ex are saying they're a slut-shamer and an asshole. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their ex were together for 8 months without having sex. That's interesting because it might suggest the author is not very sexually active or maybe they have different views on sex. Then the author found out about her past with 8 to 15 partners. The author decided to break up because of that. The ex claims they were slut-shamed, and some friends agree.\n\nNow, I need to think about the ethics here. Is it okay to end a relationship over someone's past sexual behavior? In many modern perspectives, people's pasts are their own business, and if they're in a committed relationship now, the past doesn't affect the current relationship. Unless there's something specific like cheating in the current relationship, but here it's about her college days. The author might be holding onto some purity or jealousy issues, which are their own problems.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue. If the author is judging her based on her past actions and using that as a reason to leave, that could be a form of slut-shaming. The fact that they didn't have sex themselves might indicate they have a double standard. If they were okay with their own past (2 partners) but not hers, that's hypocritical. Also, the reason for the breakup is based on something that's in the past, and how does that affect the present relationship? Unless there were other issues like dishonesty or betrayal, breaking up just over her past might not be justified.\n\nThe friends agreeing that the author is an asshole suggests that their actions are seen as judgmental and unfair. The key here is that the author is making a decision based on their ex's history, which isn't relevant to the current relationship if she's not currently being unfaithful. People have different values, but if the author can't accept her past without judgment, that's a problem. So, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they're slut-shaming and making the breakup about something that's not relevant now.\n"
