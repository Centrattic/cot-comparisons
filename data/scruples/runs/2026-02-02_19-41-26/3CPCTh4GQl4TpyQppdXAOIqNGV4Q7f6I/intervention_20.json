      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up with a partner because of her past sexual experiences. So, the author ended the relationship after finding out she had slept with multiple people in college, and some friends and the ex are calling them out for slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they were together for 8 months and never had sex. That's a bit unusual because, in many relationships of that duration, especially if they're serious, you might expect some level of physical intimacy. But not all couples are in the same place, so maybe they were both okay with that. The key issue here is the author's reaction to the ex's past, not their current behavior.\n\nThe ex had a \"party girl\" past, with 8 to 15 partners. The author has only had 2. The author broke up because of her past, which seems to be a judgment based on her previous sexual activity rather than her current actions or the relationship itself. That's a classic case of slut-shaming, where someone is criticized for their past sexual behavior, which is personal and consensual. \n\nSlut-shaming is generally frowned upon because it's about a person's history rather than their present choices. Unless there were specific issues like STIs, non-consensual acts, or something that directly affects the current relationship, judging someone's past sexual partners is not a valid reason for a breakup. The friends and the ex's reaction suggests that the author's reasoning is not socially accepted, which supports the idea that they are in the wrong.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author never had sex with the ex, so maybe there was an unspoken expectation in the relationship about remaining abstinent. If that was the case, the author might have had a point, but the way they left is about the partner's past, which is irrelevant. The ex's past doesn't affect the current relationship unless there's a breach of trust, like lying about it. But the author seems to have left because of the number, not because of any deceit.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's acceptable to end a relationship based on someone's past sexual behavior. Most modern perspectives would say no; it's a form of judgment that's not healthy in a relationship. The author's action is more about their own insecurities or strict moral views rather than the partner's actions in the present. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
