      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending the relationship because of their partner's sexual past. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was together for 8 months and never had sex. The author broke up with the ex because she had multiple partners in college\u2014between 8 to 15. The author has only been with 2. The ex and friends called the author a slut-shamer and an asshole.\n\nSo, the core issue here is whether it's fair to end a relationship based on a partner's past sexual behavior. From a modern perspective, many would argue that someone's past doesn't define their worth in a relationship, especially if the current relationship hasn't involved sexual activity. The author is holding his partner to a standard he hasn't held himself to, which could be seen as hypocritical. Also, slut-shaming is generally frowned upon, as it imposes judgment on someone's past sexual experiences, which are often personal and not relevant to the current relationship's health. \n\nHowever, some people might say that if the author has personal values or beliefs that make him uncomfortable with a partner's past, then his decision isn't necessarily wrong. But the key point here is that the breakup was based on something that occurred before the relationship, and the author's own history is significantly less. This inconsistency might make others view his actions as unfair or judgmental.\n\nIn most discussions about relationships, the consensus tends to be that past sexual history shouldn't dictate the current relationship's validity unless it's a matter of mutual values or trust. Since the couple wasn't even sexually active, the breakup seems more about the author's personal standards rather than any current behavior affecting the relationship. Therefore, the author is more likely in the wrong because he's judging his partner's past, which is not a valid reason for ending a relationship in most people's eyes. The friends and the ex calling him out suggests that his actions are considered inappropriate or hypocritical.\n"
