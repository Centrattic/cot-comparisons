      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her sexual past. The situation is that they were together for 8 months, never had sex, and he found out she had multiple partners in college (8-15). He broke up with her, and she and his friends are calling him a slut-shamer. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is ending the relationship based on the number of his ex's past sexual partners. That's a classic case of someone holding a double standard. If he's okay with sleeping with two people but is upset about her past, that's inconsistent. He might be projecting his own standards onto her, especially since they never had sex themselves. Maybe he's not ready for a sexual relationship or has different values, but using her past as a reason to break up seems unfair, especially if he's not holding himself to the same standard. \n\nAlso, slut-shaming is about judging someone for their sexual behavior, which is exactly what he's doing. The fact that his friends agree with him might indicate a social issue where such double standards are normalized. The ex's actions in the past don't necessarily affect their current relationship unless there's something like cheating involved. Since they were in a relationship for 8 months without having sex, maybe there were other issues that weren't addressed, but using her past as the reason for the breakup seems like the wrong approach. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's applying a double standard and engaging in slut-shaming. He's focusing on her past rather than current relationship dynamics or his own actions. The key point is that people have different sexual histories, and it's not fair to judge someone for their past unless it's directly relevant and agreed upon in the relationship.\n"
