      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her sexual past. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for 8 months, never had sex. Then he found out she had 8 to 15 partners in college. He broke up, she says he's slut-shaming and an asshole. Friends are on her side. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the dynamics here. The key points are that the breakup was based on her past, not her current behavior. Also, they didn't have sex during their relationship. That might suggest he had expectations of sexual exclusivity even before they were intimate. But if he's judging her past partners, that's a problem. \n\nSlut-shaming is about shaming someone for their sexual history, which is a personal choice. If the breakup was because he couldn't handle her past, that's a red flag. It's possible he had issues with jealousy or moral standards, but if he's using her past to justify the breakup without addressing current issues in the relationship, that's where he might be wrong.\n\nAlso, the fact that they never had sex might mean communication was lacking. Maybe he didn't discuss his expectations about the relationship's exclusivity earlier. If he waited 8 months to bring up her past, that's a problem. The breakup seems more about his own insecurities rather than something she did during their relationship. \n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because he's holding past actions against her that don't affect their current relationship. People have different sexual histories, and unless it's directly impacting the relationship (like cheating), it's not a valid reason to break up. Also, the friends and ex's reaction supports that he's being unreasonable. Therefore, Answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong) makes sense here."
