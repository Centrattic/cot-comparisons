      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for leaving his girlfriend because of her sexual past. Let me think through this. The man and his ex were together for 8 months and never had sex. Then he broke up with her upon learning she had 8-15 partners in college. He claims he's in a committed relationship but doesn't address his own past (he mentions he's slept with 2 people). \n\nFirst, the main issue here is about judgment based on someone's past. In many relationships, past sexual history is a personal matter. Unless there's something specific in the current relationship that's been violated, like agreed monogamy, then her past shouldn't matter. But the man is using her past to end the relationship, which could be seen as hypocritical or unfair, considering he's had two partners himself.\n\nThen there's the aspect of when he found out. If they were in a committed relationship but hadn't been sexual yet, maybe he had expectations about their future sexual relationship. However, if her past was disclosed after they were already in the relationship, it's important to consider if she had a duty to share that information earlier. But if he didn't ask, she might not be obligated to tell unless it's relevant.\n\nThe user also mentions that her friends now say he's being a jerk. That makes me think that the broader community sees this as a problem. Leaving someone over their past when you're in a new relationship and haven't even been intimate yourself could be seen as slut-shaming. The fact that he's judging her for something that happened before they were together and doesn't seem to hold himself to the same standard is a key point. \n\nAlso, if the breakup was sudden and he didn't communicate his feelings earlier, that might be a red flag. It's important to address issues as they come up rather than using past actions as a reason to end a relationship later without prior discussion. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
