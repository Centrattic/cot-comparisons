      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for breaking up with their ex because of her sexual past. They were together for 8 months without having sex. The ex had a lot of partners in college, maybe 8 to 15, while the user had only two. The user broke up with her, and now the ex and friends are saying they're a slut-shamer and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should think about the key points here. The user broke up because of the ex's past. But why? If they never had sex, maybe the user was holding onto some expectations about fidelity or past relationships. But is that fair? The user is making a judgment about her past, which is something she can't change. Slut-shaming is when someone judges another for their sexual activity, often in a derogatory way. If the user is using that as a reason to break up, that could be seen as slut-shaming.\n\nBut the user is doing it based on the number of partners, not necessarily how she behaved or communicated. However, the ex's past is in the past. Unless there's an issue with current behavior or trust, the number of past partners shouldn't affect the current relationship. The user might be projecting their own standards onto her without discussing it. Maybe they should have talked about expectations earlier. If they didn't have sex, maybe there were other issues, but breaking up because of her past when they haven't even had sex yet seems like it's more about their own insecurities or judgment rather than any actual problem in the current relationship.\n\nAlso, the user's friends are saying they're an asshole, which might indicate that their reasoning is not valid. The friends might be pointing out that the user is being judgmental. So, the user is in the wrong because they broke up over something that's not relevant to their current relationship and is making a judgment about her past without considering that people have different histories and that mutual respect is important in a relationship. The user's actions could be seen as slut-shaming, which is wrong. So the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
