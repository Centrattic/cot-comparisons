      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they broke up with their girlfriend after finding out she had a lot of sexual partners in the past. They were together for 8 months and never had sex themselves. The ex claims the person is a slut-shamer and an asshole, and some friends agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author ended the relationship based on the ex's past sexual behavior, even though they didn't have sex during their relationship. The ex's past is in the past, so it's about her history, not current actions. The author's own sexual history is mentioned as 2 partners, while the ex had 8-15. \n\nNow, slut-shaming is about judging someone for their sexual behavior, often in a derogatory way. If the author is making a judgment about her past and using that as a reason to end the relationship, that could be seen as slut-shaming. However, the author might argue that their values or expectations for a relationship require monogamy or a certain past, so it's a personal choice. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many perspectives, holding someone's past against them, especially when it's consensual and in the past, is considered unfair and judgmental. The fact that they didn't have sex during their relationship but broke up over her past might indicate that the issue isn't her current actions but her history, which could be seen as hypocritical or judgmental. \n\nAlso, the friends and the ex's reaction suggest that others see it as slut-shaming. The author's friends are on the ex's side, which might indicate that the author's actions are socially frowned upon. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because ending a relationship based on a partner's past sexual behavior without any impact on the current relationship can be seen as unjust and hypocritical, especially given their own history. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
