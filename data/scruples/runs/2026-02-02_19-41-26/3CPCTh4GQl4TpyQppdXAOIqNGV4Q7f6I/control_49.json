      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend because of her sexual past is in the wrong. They were together for 8 months without having sex, and then the guy found out she had a lot of partners in college. He broke up with her, and she and some friends think he's a jerk.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The relationship had been going on for 8 months without sex, which might indicate that they were in a committed or maybe even asexual relationship. The guy's decision to break up is based on her past, not her current behavior. So, maybe he's holding her past against her. But why would he care about her past? If he was okay with her in the present and they were not having sex, maybe his issue is more about jealousy or insecurity. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real problem. If he's judging her for her past sexual experiences, that's a form of slut-shaming. The fact that she's not currently being promiscuous and they hadn't even had sex yet might make that an issue. The friends also called him an asshole, which could suggest that his actions are seen as unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy might have had personal boundaries or values that were violated. If he's not into casual sex and her past includes many partners, he might feel uncomfortable. But is it fair to end the relationship after 8 months because of that? Especially if they weren't having sex themselves. Maybe they had an agreement or an expectation of exclusivity. But if they were in a relationship, some level of trust should be there. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The breakup was based on her past, not present actions. 2) They weren't having sex, so maybe he's projecting his own insecurities. 3) The term \"slut shaming\" is used, which is a negative judgment. 4) Friends support the ex more than him, implying his action is seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the consensus is usually that judging someone's past isn't right unless there's a specific reason, like infidelity during the relationship. Since she's not currently being unfaithful, and the breakup is based on her history, which is her personal life, the guy probably is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
