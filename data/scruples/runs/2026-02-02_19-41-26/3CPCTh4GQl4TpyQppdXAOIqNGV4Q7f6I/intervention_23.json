We never had sex. Yesterday I broke up with her after learning about her past. She was a bit of a party girl in college and ended up sleeping with a few guys. By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her sexual past. The guy is in a relationship where they never had sex, and he found out she had multiple partners in college, up to 15. He broke up with her, and she and his friends are calling him a slut-shamer and an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the reason for the breakup and the societal expectations around sexual history in relationships. The man is ending the relationship because of his partner's past sexual behavior, which she had before they met. That seems like a classic case of slut-shaming, especially since they didn't engage in sexual activity during their relationship. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone judges or criticizes another person, usually a woman, for their sexual behavior. It's often based on double standards where men are more accepted for having multiple partners than women. In this case, the man is holding his ex to a standard he himself doesn't meet (he's had two partners), which could indicate hypocrisy. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were in a relationship for 8 months without having sex might suggest that the man had his own boundaries, but he's now judging her for her past. It's possible that his reaction is more about his own feelings of jealousy or insecurity rather than any actual issue in their current relationship. \n\nFriends calling him an asshole probably because they recognize the double standard or the unfair judgment. The ex's reaction is also valid because she's being criticized for her past, which shouldn't affect the current relationship if both partners are committed and honest now. \n\nSo, the man's reasoning for the breakup is based on her past, which isn't relevant to their current relationship. That makes him the asshole here. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
