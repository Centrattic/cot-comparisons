We never had sex. Yesterday I broke up with her after learning about her past. She was a bit of a party girl in college and ended up sleeping with a few guys. By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for breaking up with their partner because of her sexual past. They were in a relationship for 8 months without having sex. The ex had a lot of partners in college, maybe 8 to 15, while the author has only had 2. Now the ex is upset, and some friends say the author is an asshole for being a \"slut shamer.\"\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The author broke up because of the partner's past, not because of anything happening in their current relationship. That seems problematic. If they were okay with not having sex during the relationship but then had an issue with her past, that could be judgmental. People have different pasts, and unless there's something current that affects the relationship, judging someone's history might not be fair.\n\nAlso, the fact that they never had sex themselves might be a red flag. Maybe the author had expectations about their partner's past that they weren't even addressing in their own relationship. It's possible they were projecting their own insecurities or moral standards onto the relationship. If they were okay with not having sex, why was the number of her past partners an issue? That doesn't align.\n\nThe ex's reaction, calling the author a slut shamer, makes sense because slut shaming is about criticizing someone's past without a valid reason, especially when it's not affecting the current relationship. The author's friends agreeing with the ex suggests that the author might be in the wrong here. They should have considered whether their reasons for breaking up were valid or just based on personal judgment.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's decision to leave based solely on the partner's past without it impacting their current relationship seems unfair. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
