      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their ex because of her sexual past. They were together for 8 months, never had sex, and then found out she had a lot of past partners. The user claims they're not a prude, but their friends are calling them a hypocrite and a shamer. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of relationships and communication. If they were in a relationship for 8 months and never had sex, that's a pretty long time without physical intimacy. Maybe there were other issues here, like personal boundaries or unmet expectations. But the user's reason for the breakup is based on her past, not the present actions. \n\nNow, slut shaming is when someone judges or criticizes another for their sexual behavior, often in a derogatory way. The user is saying they broke up because she slept with many people in the past. If they didn't have sex with her during their relationship, that's her choice or their mutual agreement. However, bringing up her past like this might be seen as judgmental, especially if there's no current infidelity. \n\nThe user's friends think they're an asshole, which suggests that their actions might have been harsh or unfair. The ex girlfriend might feel hurt because the breakup is based on her past, not her current behavior towards them. In a healthy relationship, past experiences shouldn't matter if both are committed now. Unless there's a specific issue, like jealousy or controlling behavior, the user's reason for breaking up seems outdated. \n\nAlso, the user mentions they never had sex, so maybe there were underlying issues about their own readiness or expectations. But using her past as the reason to end the relationship could be a way to avoid confronting their own reservations. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, it's about whether the user's actions were justified. Since the relationships are in the past and there's no indication of ongoing behavior affecting their current relationship, the breakup might be more about the user's insecurities or double standards. If the user is okay with their own past (2 partners) but not hers, that's a double standard. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A, the user is in the wrong because they judged her past actions which don't affect the current relationship, and their friends support that view.\n"
