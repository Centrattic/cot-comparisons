By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote about breaking up with their ex because of her sexual past is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person was in a relationship for 8 months without having sex, then broke up upon learning about their ex's past. The ex had multiple partners in college, up to 15, while the person had only two. The ex and some friends called them a \"slut shamer\" and an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. In relationships, especially in Western cultures, people often have different values and expectations. One key point is that past sexual history shouldn't determine the validity of a relationship if both partners are okay with it. The author is choosing to end the relationship based on the ex's past, which is a personal choice, but it might be problematic if it's based on judgment or double standards.\n\nThe author hasn't had sex with their partner despite being in a relationship for 8 months. That might indicate their own personal boundaries or maybe personal issues. If they were okay with their own past (two partners) but not hers (8-15), that's a double standard. It's not fair to judge someone else's choices if you've made similar ones yourself. So that's a point towards the author being in the wrong.\n\nAlso, slut-shaming is about making negative judgments about someone's sexual behavior, especially women, in a way that's degrading or controlling. If the author is doing that, then they could be in the wrong. The ex's reaction and friends' support suggest that the author's actions were seen as judgmental.\n\nBut maybe the author had other reasons. For example, if they had specific religious or moral beliefs that they were adhering to, but the problem is that they didn't address this earlier. If they didn't discuss their expectations about sexual history from the start, then it's their fault for not setting boundaries early. Relationships should be built on honesty and communication, not ultimatums based on undisclosed expectations.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author is making a judgment based on their partner's past, which is a personal choice and not a deal-breaker unless both parties agree. The double standard and the lack of prior communication suggest the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
