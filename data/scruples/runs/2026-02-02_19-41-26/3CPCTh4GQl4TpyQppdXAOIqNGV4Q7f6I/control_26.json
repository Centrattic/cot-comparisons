      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who left their girlfriend because of her sexual past is in the wrong. The situation is that they were together for 8 months, never had sex, and he broke up after finding out she had multiple partners in college. He says he's not in the wrong, but his ex and friends think he's slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is whether it's acceptable for someone to end a relationship based on their partner's past sexual history. The man never had sex with her but decided to break up because of her past. That seems a bit contradictory if they didn't even have a sexual relationship themselves. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real problem, and it's about judging someone for their sexual activity. If he's judging her past while they didn't have a sexual relationship, that could be seen as hypocritical. Also, the number of partners she had in the past shouldn't affect the current relationship if both partners are okay with it now. \n\nI should also think about mutual respect in a relationship. If he couldn't accept her past, maybe that's a personal issue rather than a justification for breaking up. The fact that they never had sex suggests that maybe he had his own boundaries, but using her past against her could be seen as unfair. \n\nHis friends agreeing that he's an asshole might indicate that his reasoning is not socially accepted. People generally don't hold past actions against someone in a current relationship unless there's a specific issue like cheating during the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's making a judgment about her past that's not relevant to their current relationship, which is a form of slut-shaming. He's not in a position to judge her past when he himself has had multiple partners, even if fewer. The breakup is based on her history rather than any current behavior, which is typically not a valid reason unless there's a fundamental disagreement about values or current actions.\n"
