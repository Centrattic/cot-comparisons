      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who left the girl over her sexual past is in the wrong. The situation is that they were together for 8 months, didn't have sex, and then he found out she had multiple partners in college. He broke up with her, and now she and his friends are calling him a slut-shamer and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical and relationship aspects here. The key points are: the breakup reason is based on her past, which is irrelevant to their current relationship. In most relationships, especially in modern times, people's past sexual experiences are not typically a valid reason to end a relationship unless there are specific issues like STIs that weren't disclosed, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nThe fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship might indicate that the issue isn't her past but perhaps his own insecurities or personal standards. Also, the discrepancy in the number of partners (8 vs. 15) shows that maybe he was focused on the number rather than her current behavior. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone criticizes another for their sexual behavior, especially if it's judgmental and based on gender stereotypes. By judging her past, he's likely engaging in that. The friends backing her up suggests that his actions are seen as hypocritical or unfair. \n\nThe user's question is whether he's in the wrong. Choosing between A and B. A would mean he is wrong, B that he isn't. Considering the context, the answer leans towards A because breaking up over someone's past sexual history without a legitimate reason (like health issues) is generally considered judgmental and unfair. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
