      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her sexual past. The situation is that they were together for 8 months, never had sex, and he found out she had multiple partners in college. He ended the relationship, and she accused him of slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the reason for the breakup. The author broke up because of her past, which is something that can be sensitive. Let's think about personal values and boundaries. If someone has a value against premarital sex or a certain number of partners, that's their choice, but acting on that in a relationship can be seen as judgmental.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where someone is criticized or judged for their sexual behavior, especially if it's done in a way that's misogynistic or controlling. The author's decision to leave based on her past could be seen as slut-shaming if it's not based on mutual respect. However, if he had clear boundaries and communicated them before the relationship, maybe it's not. But since they were already in a relationship for 8 months and didn't have sex, it's possible he didn't communicate his expectations early enough.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's a \"party girl\" in college might not directly affect their current relationship. Unless there's a specific issue like STIs or infidelity, her past doesn't impact their present. The author might be holding onto outdated or conservative views about sexual history, which can lead to unfair judgments.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author couldn't handle her past and felt it was deal-breaking, maybe he isn't the right partner for her. However, breaking up after 8 months for something that happened before they met could be seen as holding a grudge or not accepting her for who she is. The friends agreeing that he's an asshole suggest that the social consensus leans towards him being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because his reaction is based on her past actions that don't affect their relationship now, and it's a judgmental stance that can be seen as slut-shaming. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
