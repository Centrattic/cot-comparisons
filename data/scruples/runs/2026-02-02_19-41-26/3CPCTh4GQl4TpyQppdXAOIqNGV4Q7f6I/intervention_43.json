We never had sex. Yesterday I broke up with her after learning about her past. She was a bit of a party girl in college and ended up sleeping with a few guys. By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was in a relationship for 8 months and they never had sex. Then they found out the ex had slept with 8 to 15 guys in college and decided to break up, calling it \"her sexual past.\" The author's friends say they're a slut-shamer and an asshole. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The key points here are that the ex was a \"party girl in college,\" which is a past time. The author and ex were in a relationship for 8 months but didn't have sex. That's interesting because if they were together but not having sex, maybe the author had certain expectations about abstinence or monogamy. But the breakup is based on the ex's past, not current behavior. \n\nSlut-shaming usually involves judging someone for their sexual behavior, often in a derogatory or misogynistic way. If the author broke up with the ex because of how many people they had been with before the relationship started, that could be seen as slut-shaming. Especially since the ex is female and the number of partners is from her college days, which is in the past. The author's own count is two, which is significantly lower, but they're ending the relationship over the ex's past actions. \n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't had sex in 8 months might indicate that the author had expectations about not having sex before marriage or some other standard. But if the ex's past actions are the reason for the breakup, it's about her past, not the current relationship's dynamics. That could be a red flag for double standards. If the author is okay with their own two partners but not with the ex having more, even if it's from before they met, that's a problem. \n\nThe friends agreeing that the author is in the wrong suggests that their actions were not socially acceptable. People usually frown upon judging a partner's past partners unless there's a specific reason like STI risks or trust issues. But in this case, there's no mention of those factors. It seems like the author is ending the relationship based on the ex's past, which is a common example of slut-shaming. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is using the ex's past number of partners as a reason to break up, which can be seen as holding a grudge over something that happened years ago and isn't relevant to their current relationship. That's likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
