We never had sex. Yesterday I broke up with her after learning about her past. She was a bit of a party girl in college and ended up sleeping with a few guys. By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up with a partner due to her past sexual history. The author and his ex were together for eight months without having sex, and he ended the relationship after learning she had multiple partners in college. The ex claims he was slut-shaming, and some friends agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't have sex with her during their relationship, which might indicate he had personal or religious reasons for abstinence. However, the breakup was based on her past. The key issue here is whether holding someone's past against them is justified.\n\nIn modern relationships, people often have different values. If the author was okay with her past when they started dating but later found out and broke up, that could be seen as inconsistent. Also, the number of past partners doesn't inherently harm the current relationship unless there are specific deal-breakers discussed. Since they didn't have sex, maybe he had different expectations. But making a decision based on her history without prior discussion might come off as judgmental. Slut-shaming is about judging someone for their sexual activity, so if he condemned her without understanding her perspective, he's in the wrong. Friends' opinions also suggest that his actions were not well-received. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
