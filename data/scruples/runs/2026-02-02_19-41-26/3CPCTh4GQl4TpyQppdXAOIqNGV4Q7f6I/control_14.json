By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that he broke up with his girlfriend after finding out she had a lot of sexual partners in her past. They were together for 8 months and never had sex. He says she was a party girl in college, maybe 8 to 15 partners, while he had only two. His friends and the ex are saying he's being a jerk and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The main issue is whether it's reasonable for him to end the relationship based on her past sexual history. In many modern perspectives, a person's past relationships shouldn't affect current ones unless there are specific issues like infidelity during the relationship. Since they never had sex themselves, her past might not be relevant. He's making a judgment about her based on her history, which could be seen as slut-shaming. That's a term used when someone judges another person, especially a woman, for their sexual behavior, which is often considered hypocritical or unfair because it enforces double standards.\n\nAlso, the fact that they hadn't had sex yet in their 8-month relationship might indicate different expectations. Maybe he had certain expectations about their relationship's future, but ending it after 8 months because of her past seems harsh. The friends agreeing with the ex suggests that his reaction might be out of line. People often have different values, but being judgmental about someone's past is generally frowned upon.\n\nAnother angle: if he had specific issues with her past, like STI concerns, that's a health issue, but he didn't mention that. It seems more like a personal judgment. So, the author is in the wrong because he's judging her for past actions that don't affect their current relationship. The answer should be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
