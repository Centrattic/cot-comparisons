By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her sexual past. The situation is that they had been together for 8 months without having sex, and the guy found out she had a lot of sexual partners in college. He broke up with her, and now she and his friends are saying he's being a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether it's justified for the guy to end the relationship based on her past sexual history. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the opinion here.\n\nSo, thinking about this, in modern relationships, people's pasts are generally considered their own business unless it's directly affecting the current relationship. The fact that they hadn't had sex yet means that her past sexual activity might not be relevant to their current relationship. Choosing to end the relationship based on her past could be seen as holding onto outdated or judgmental views.\n\nAlso, slut-shaming is about shaming someone, especially a woman, for their sexual behavior. If the guy is critical of her past without acknowledging her autonomy, that could be seen as slut-shaming. The fact that she was honest about her past and he reacted by breaking up might indicate that his issue is more about his own insecurities or moral judgments rather than something about their relationship's dynamics.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the guy's values are such that he can't be in a relationship with someone who has a different number of sexual partners, then maybe it's a deal-breaker. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's making a judgment about her past and it's causing harm, even if it's his own decision, it might still be seen as wrong because it's not her current behavior and she's being honest about it.\n\nAlso, since they hadn't had sex yet, his decision to end the relationship before knowing her current stance on their future sexual relationship could be problematic. It might be more about his own issues with her past rather than something concrete in their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's making a judgment based on her past which isn't relevant to their current relationship, and it's a form of slut-shaming. His friends and her calling him an asshole supports that view."
