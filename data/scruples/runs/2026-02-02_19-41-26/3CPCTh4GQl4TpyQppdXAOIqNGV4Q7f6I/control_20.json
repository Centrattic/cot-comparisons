      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and their ex were together for 8 months and never had sex. The author broke up with the girl after finding out about her sexual past. She was a party girl in college and slept with 8 guys, possibly up to 15. The author has slept with 2. The ex says the author was slut-shaming and an asshole, and some friends agree. The question is, is the author in the wrong? Answer A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let me consider the key points here. The author is ending the relationship because of the other person's past sexual behavior. The fact that they never had sex themselves might be significant. The ex feels judged and called out for her history, which is common in slut-shaming scenarios. The friends also support the view that the author was wrong, but I should focus on the situation itself rather than third-party opinions.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves criticizing someone's sexual history, often implying they are immoral or not a good partner. If the author is making a judgment based on the number of people the ex has been with, that could be seen as slut-shaming. Even if the author's intention was to be honest, if it's about the ex's past and not about any current behavior or issues, it might be inappropriate. The fact that they never had sex during their 8-month relationship suggests there might be other underlying issues, like differing sexual expectations or lack of intimacy. However, the author's decision to break up specifically because of her past might be the problem.\n\nAlso, considering that the ex's friends say the author is an asshole, it's possible that the author's approach was disrespectful. People's sexual histories are personal, and unless it's affecting the current relationship (like not being honest, having STIs, or emotional issues), it's usually not a valid reason to end a relationship. The author's own history (2 partners) is less, but that doesn't make the ex's history wrong. Everyone has different values, but acting on someone else's past in this way might not be fair.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have had personal issues or insecurity, leading them to act out. It's possible the author wasn't open to the idea of their partner having a past, which isn't the partner's fault. But using that as a reason to break up without addressing their own feelings or discussing it openly could be problematic. The ex's reaction is understandable if the breakup was abrupt and judgmental.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they ended the relationship based on the ex's past sexual behavior without a genuine, mutual reason. This can be seen as disrespectful and judgmental, hence slut-shaming. The answer would be A.\n"
