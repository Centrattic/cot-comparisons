By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their ex over her sexual past is in the wrong. The situation involves an 8-month relationship where they never had sex. The guy ends things because she had a certain number of sexual partners in the past. She claims he's being a jerk, and some friends agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy has only slept with two people, while she's had up to 15. But he broke up with her because of her past, not her current behavior. Is that fair? Well, if they never had sex, maybe there were unspoken expectations about exclusivity or past experiences. But is it his right to judge her past? That's where the problem might lie.\n\nSlut-shaming is generally considered negative because it's about someone's past choices, which shouldn't affect their worth. If he's holding her past against her, especially after eight months of not having sex, that could be seen as hypocritical or unfair. He might have his own standards, but imposing them without discussing them upfront could be the issue. She might feel judged, and friends supporting her might think he's being unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the fact that they never had sex might indicate that he had reservations, and instead of communicating that, he waited until later to bring up her past. That could be a communication breakdown. So, he's in the wrong because he's blaming her past for their breakup without addressing his own expectations earlier. Therefore, answer A.\n"
