      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend after finding out she had a past where she was a \"party girl\" in college and had slept with several guys, maybe 8 to 15. He only had sex with two people. He's being called a slut-shamer and an asshole by his ex and friends. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship lasted 8 months, and they never had sex. That's a key point. If the author was okay with abstinence during the relationship, why did the partner's past affect the breakup? Maybe he had different expectations about sexual history. But the main issue here is that her past actions are in the past and shouldn't affect the current relationship's validity. \n\nSlut-shaming is about judging someone based on their sexual history, which is considered unfair. The author's decision to end the relationship because of something that happened before they were together could be seen as holding her past against her. That's a red flag. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's comparing their numbers (he's with 2, she's with 8-15) is problematic. Sexual history isn't a competition. What matters is the current relationship's dynamics. If he was comfortable with her past when they were together but became uncomfortable later, that's more about his own insecurities or judgment rather than her actions.\n\nFriends supporting his ex and calling him an asshole suggest that his actions might be seen as hypocritical or unfair. The ex's accusation of slut-shaming is likely valid here. The author is holding her past sexual behavior against her, which is a form of slut-shaming. \n\nHowever, there's a line where personal values and boundaries come into play. If the author had discussed his expectations earlier, it might have been a valid point. But breaking up after 8 months specifically over her past seems more like an issue with his own judgment rather than her behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
