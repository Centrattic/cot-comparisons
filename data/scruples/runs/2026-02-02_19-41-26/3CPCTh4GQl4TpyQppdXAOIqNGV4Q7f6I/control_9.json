      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his ex because of her sexual past. So, first, I need to understand the context. They were together for 8 months and didn't have sex. The guy breaks up with her because he found out about her past, where she had multiple partners. He claims she had up to 15, and he had two. Now she and his friends think he's a jerk for it.\n\nHmm. So, the first thing that comes to mind is that judging someone's past sexual behavior can be a form of slut-shaming, especially if it's not affecting the current relationship. But the guy might have personal reasons or values that make this an issue for him. However, since they didn't have sex yet, maybe his reaction is based on assumptions or his own insecurities. \n\nWait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he broke up with her because he couldn't accept her past, even though that past didn't impact their relationship, then maybe he is being judgmental. It's important to consider mutual respect and consent in relationships. If he didn't communicate his feelings about this beforehand, he might be at fault for not addressing it earlier. Also, holding someone's past against them when they're not currently engaging in the behavior he dislikes could be unfair. \n\nBut then again, if his values are such that he can't be in a relationship with someone who has had multiple partners, that's his personal choice. However, acting on that judgment after 8 months without discussing it first might be the problem. The key here is whether his actions were based on her current behavior or his own past. Since she's not doing anything now, judging her past could be seen as holding a grudge or being hypocritical if he's had a couple of partners too. \n\nSo, in most cases, people are advised to focus on the present and the current relationship dynamics rather than past experiences unless there are ongoing issues. Since the breakup was based on her history and not on her current actions, the author might be in the wrong for being judgmental. Also, the fact that his friends are siding with her suggests that his actions might not be widely accepted as justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be AITA for the author because he judged her past, which doesn't affect their current relationship, leading to a breakup without proper communication. That's probably why the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
