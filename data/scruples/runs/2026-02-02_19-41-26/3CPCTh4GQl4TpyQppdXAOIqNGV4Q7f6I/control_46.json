      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his ex due to her sexual past. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were together for 8 months, didn't have sex. He broke up because he found out she had multiple partners in college, maybe 8-15. He's been with 2. His ex called him a slut-shamer and an asshole, and some friends agree. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, slut-shaming is a big issue. Judging someone's past sexual behavior, especially if they're not currently being unfaithful, is generally frowned upon. The key points here are that the breakup was based on her past, not any current issues. The fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship is interesting too. Maybe he had his own expectations about virginity or past partners that weren't discussed.\n\nHe might have had his reasons, but the problem is that judging someone's past choices, especially without it affecting their current relationship, can be seen as unfair. Also, the number of partners is subjective; what's a lot for one person isn't for another. The ex feeling targeted and the friends agreeing he's an asshole suggests that his approach was hurtful.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal boundaries. If he felt uncomfortable and couldn't reconcile that, maybe ending the relationship was his choice. However, the way he did it\u2014without addressing his own biases\u2014might make him at fault. Slut-shaming is a serious accusation, so if he was indeed doing that, he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably A (he's in the wrong) because his judgment of her past, leading to the breakup, is slut-shaming, which is inappropriate. Even if he felt conflicted, the action of breaking up based on her history without it affecting their current relationship is problematic."
