      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup due to the ex's past sexual relationships. The guy broke up with his ex because she had multiple partners in college, while he only had two. He's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the reasons for the breakup. The author is leaving because of her past, even though they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship. That makes me think maybe he had some expectations about her being a virgin or not having many past partners. But why would that be a dealbreaker? It's important to consider societal norms and personal values here.\n\nThe ex called him out for slut-shaming, which is a serious accusation. If he's judging her past sexual behavior in a way that's derogatory, that's problematic. However, if it's about personal boundaries, maybe he felt uncomfortable with her history. But in a relationship, people usually have discussions about such things. Did they talk about this before getting serious? If not, breaking up later because of it might come off as holding a grudge or not being honest about his expectations.\n\nAlso, the number of past partners isn't the only factor. The fact that they didn't have sex during their relationship might mean he had other issues, like not being ready for a sexual relationship, but he's using her past as a reason. That could be a way to avoid taking responsibility for his own feelings or boundaries.\n\nFriends calling him an asshole suggests that his friends don't support this reasoning. It's possible that they see it as unfair or hypocritical, especially if he's not holding himself to the same standard. The author's actions might be seen as judgmental, especially given that he has his own past with two partners. The number difference (8 vs. 15 vs. 2) could be a red herring; the real issue might be his judgment of her lifestyle rather than the actual numbers.\n\nIn terms of ethics, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries, but using someone's past sexual behavior as a reason to end a relationship can be seen as invalid if it's not discussed upfront. It might also reflect more on the author's personal issues rather than her actions. The key is whether he was honest about his expectations from the start. If he didn't communicate his boundaries and is only bringing it up now, that's a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because he's making a judgment based on her past without addressing it earlier, leading to accusations of slut-shaming. His friends' reactions back this up. Therefore, Answer A would be the correct choice.\n"
