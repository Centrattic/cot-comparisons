      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because of her sexual past. They were together for 8 months and never had sex. The guy found out she had a lot of sexual partners in college and decided to break up. Now, she and his friends are saying he's being a jerk and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is judging his ex based on her past, which is something she did before they were in a relationship. They had only been together for 8 months and didn't even have sex yet. That might be a red flag. It's possible he's holding her past against her, which isn't fair because their relationship started after that period. \n\nSlut-shaming is about judging someone for their sexual behavior, especially when it's not relevant to the current relationship. If he's using her past to justify breaking up without addressing any current issues in their relationship, that's problematic. Also, the numbers (8 to 15 partners) are from her college years, which is a time when many people are more sexually active. Comparing his own 2 partners against hers could be hypocritical or irrelevant.\n\nHis friends calling him an asshole suggests that his actions were socially frowned upon. The key points here are whether his decision was based on valid reasons related to their current relationship or just her past. Since they didn't have sex yet, her past might not affect their current dynamic. The author is making a judgment based on something that happened before they met, which isn't his place to dictate. So, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong (A).\n"
