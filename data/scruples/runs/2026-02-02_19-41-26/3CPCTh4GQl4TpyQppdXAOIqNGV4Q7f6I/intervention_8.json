By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because of her sexual past. The situation is that they were together for 8 months without having sex, and he found out she had 8 to 15 sexual partners in college. He broke up with her, and she and his friends now think he's being a jerk or slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are the reason for the breakup and societal norms. The author is ending the relationship based on his partner's past, which is something she has already done and can't change. That seems like a double standard unless he was honest about his values before the relationship. If he didn't discuss his expectations regarding past relationships or sexual history earlier, then it's his fault for not being upfront. \n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship is interesting. Maybe he had specific expectations about virginity or monogamy that weren't communicated. If he wasn't willing to have sex with her but was upset about her past, that's a contradiction. It might indicate that his issue isn't with her past per se but with his own insecurities or hypocrisy.\n\nSlut-shaming is about criticizing someone for their sexual behavior, which is exactly what he's doing. Even if he doesn't intend to, by ending the relationship based on her past, he's making a judgment that her choices were wrong, which is a form of slut-shaming. His friends agreeing with that judgment reinforces the idea that he's in the wrong because his friends are also applying the same standards without considering her autonomy.\n\nAnother angle is that people's pasts don't define their current relationships. If the ex was honest about her past and he found it incompatible, maybe there was a mismatch in values. But the problem arises when the reason for the breakup is judgmental and not about current behavior. Since she's not doing anything now that he's objecting to, his reasons are based on past actions, which is unfair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his expectations, is being judgmental about something she can't change, and is engaging in slut-shaming. The answer should be A.\n"
