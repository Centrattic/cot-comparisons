      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her sexual past is in the wrong. The situation is that they were together for 8 months without having sex, and the guy ended things after learning she had around 8-15 partners in college. He's been with 2 people. His friends and ex think he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether it's acceptable to break up someone over their past sexual history, especially if it's from college. The question is about whether the author is at fault. \n\nOne angle is about double standards. The guy has been with 2 partners, but he's judging her for being with more. It's possible that he's applying a different standard to her than he does to himself. If he's okay with his own history but not hers, that could be seen as slut-shaming, which is a form of judgment based on gendered expectations. \n\nAnother point is that they hadn't had sex yet in their 8-month relationship. Maybe there were other issues in the relationship that led to the breakup that weren't discussed. Ending the relationship because of her past could be seen as holding a grudge over something that happened before they were together. Communication is key in relationships, and if he had values that were important to him (like monogamy or specific sexual history expectations), perhaps he should have discussed them earlier. \n\nAlso, societal expectations come into play. In many modern discussions, there's a push against shaming people for their past sexual experiences, especially if they're not in the current relationship. The idea is that a person's past doesn't define them, and such judgments can be hypocritical or unfair. The ex's friends agreeing that the author is in the wrong might reflect that perspective.\n\nBut then again, personal preferences do matter. If someone has a strong moral issue with their partner's past, it's their right to make that decision, even if others might see it as wrong. However, the way it's being framed\u2014calling her a \"party girl\" and ending the relationship over it\u2014could be seen as judgmental and not respecting her autonomy.\n\nI should also think about the fact that they never had sex. Maybe there were underlying issues like his sexual hesitancy or other incompatibilities. If the breakup was primarily about her past, it might be a cop-out for other problems. \n\nIn terms of moral rightness, the author is making a choice based on his own values, but if those values lead to shaming or devaluing someone else for things that are generally accepted as personal choices, then he's in the wrong. The key here is the concept of slut-shaming, which is generally frowned upon. So the answer might lean towards A, that he's in the wrong.\n"
