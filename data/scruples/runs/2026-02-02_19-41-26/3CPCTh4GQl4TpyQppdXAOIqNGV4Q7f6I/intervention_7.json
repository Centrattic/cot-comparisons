By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that after 8 months of a relationship without sex, the author broke up with the girl because of her past sexual history\u2014she had multiple partners in college, and he felt that was a reason to end things. His friends and the ex say he's being a jerk and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether it's reasonable or acceptable to end a relationship based on a partner's past sexual behavior. The author's decision is based on her history, not her current actions or their relationship. The fact that they didn't have sex in 8 months is also notable. \n\nSlut-shaming is a big part of the criticism here. If the author is judging her for her past, even if it's not relevant to their current relationship, that's a red flag. People have different sexual histories, and unless there's a specific issue like infidelity in the current relationship, the past shouldn't matter. The author's friends agree he's in the wrong, which might indicate that his reasoning isn't socially accepted.\n\nAlso, the length of the relationship (8 months) without sex suggests that maybe the author wasn't ready for a sexual relationship, but he's using her past as a reason to end it. It's possible he's projecting his own expectations or insecurities onto her. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author has personal beliefs that make him uncomfortable with her past. But even then, if he can't accept her as she is, then maybe the breakup is his decision, but the way he framed it (slut-shaming) is problematic. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were justified. Since the ex is calling him out and friends agree, it seems like he's being hypocritical or judgmental. Unless there was a mutual agreement about exclusivity and he felt betrayed, but the question is about her past, not current behavior. \n\nSo, the conclusion would be that the author is in the wrong because he's judging her past, which is not his place, and it's a form of slut-shaming. So answer A.\n"
