      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the person is ending a relationship because their ex had a sexual past. They were together for 8 months and didn't have sex. The ex had multiple partners in college (8 to 15), and the person ended the relationship because of that. Now friends and the ex are saying they're a sluttish and an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author's reason for breaking up is based on their partner's past relationships. The main issue is whether it's fair or acceptable to end a relationship for reasons related to someone's past, especially their sexual history. \n\nIn many modern perspectives, a person's past sexual experiences are their own business, and it's not considered acceptable to judge someone for that. The author is making a decision based on their personal standards, but that doesn't mean it's valid. The problem is that the author is holding their partner to a standard they might not hold themselves to, which can be seen as hypocritical or judgmental. The ex is accusing the author of slut-shaming, which is a form of gender-based judgment and is generally frowned upon.\n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship suggests that there might have been other issues or unspoken expectations. The author might have had a double standard\u2014perhaps they expected their partner to be sexually exclusive or inexperienced, while they themselves have had a few partners. That inconsistency can lead to being seen as hypocritical.\n\nAdditionally, the friends agreeing that the author is wrong indicates that the social norm in their circle is against such reasoning. In many cases, people are encouraged to accept their partners for who they are, past included, unless there are current issues like cheating. Since the ex's past is in college and not affecting the current relationship, it's more about personal judgment than actual behavior in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author is likely in the wrong because they are being judgmental about a personal aspect of their ex's life that doesn't impact their current relationship. The key here is the judgment and the imposition of personal standards on another person, which is generally considered unfair or oppressive. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
