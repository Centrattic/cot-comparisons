      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again. The person broke up with their girlfriend after 8 months because they found out about her past\u2014she had multiple partners in college. The author never had sex with her, and he's upset because she had 8 or 15 partners while he only had 2. His ex says he's slut-shaming her, and his friends agree. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are: the breakup reason, the comparison of past partners, and the concept of slut-shaming. \n\nThe author is ending the relationship because of his girlfriend's past, which is something that happened before they were together. If they had an open relationship or discussed expectations, maybe it's different, but the scenario doesn't mention that. He's choosing to leave her over her past, which isn't his to judge. People have different sexual histories, and unless there were specific agreements about exclusivity before the relationship started, it's not fair to hold past actions against someone. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone is criticized or judged for their sexual behavior. The author is doing that by ending the relationship based on her number of past partners. Even if he has a lower number, that doesn't justify judging her. Everyone's past is different, and it's not a valid reason to end a relationship unless there's a specific issue like cheating in the current relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that they never had sex in 8 months might be a red flag, but that's separate from her past. The breakup reason here seems to be about her past, not her current behavior. So the author is holding her past against her, which is not his place. His friends and the ex are pointing out the slut-shaming, which suggests that the author is in the wrong for making a judgment based on something that doesn't affect their current relationship.\n\nSo the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong because he's judging her past and slut-shaming her, which is not acceptable.\n"
