      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for leaving their girlfriend over her sexual past. The situation is that they were together for 8 months, never had sex, and he broke up with her after finding out she had multiple partners in college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person says they never had sex, which might mean he's a virgin or chose abstinence. The breakup is based on her past, which is in college and before they were together. The key here is whether it's fair to judge someone's past, especially if it's not affecting the current relationship. \n\nSlut-shaming is a big issue. If he's judging her for her past behavior that's not relevant to their relationship now, then he might be in the wrong. The fact that her friends are calling him an asshole suggests that his actions are seen as unfair. \n\nAlso, in a relationship, communication is important. If he had values about his partner's sexual history before the relationship, he should have discussed that openly. Ending the relationship after 8 months specifically because of her past might be seen as holding onto outdated or judgmental views. \n\nOn the other hand, personal values and boundaries vary. If he felt that her past was a deal-breaker, even if it's in the past, he might genuinely have a problem with it. But that's where the line between personal preference and judgment comes into play. \n\nIn many modern perspectives, a person's past sexual experiences don't define their worth, and bringing it up after a breakup could be seen as holding a grudge. The fact that he never had sex with her might indicate pressure or expectations he wasn't comfortable meeting, and he's projecting his own insecurities onto her past.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he's judging her past which doesn't affect their current relationship, and it's a form of slut-shaming. However, if he had clear boundaries and communicated them, it's a bit more nuanced, but the way he acted post-breakup suggests it's more about his judgment rather than a mutual decision.\n"
