      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they broke up with their ex after finding out she had a certain number of sexual partners in college, while they themselves had 2. Their friends and the ex are saying they're a \"slut shamer\" and an asshole. So the question is, is the author at fault here?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was together for 8 months without having sex, which is interesting. The breakup is based on her past, not their current relationship's sexual activity. The key issue here is whether it's acceptable to end a relationship over a partner's past sexual history, especially when the current relationship hasn't involved sex yet. \n\nSlut shaming typically involves making someone feel guilty or judged for their sexual history or behavior. If the person is holding her past against her in a current relationship where they were abstaining from sex, that could be seen as hypocritical. The author might be projecting their own standards onto her, especially since they have a similar or more lenient history themselves. \n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't have sex in 8 months suggests there might have been unspoken expectations or boundaries. If the breakup is because they disapprove of her past but aren't willing to engage in a sexual relationship themselves, that could be inconsistent. It's possible that the author's decision is based on personal discomfort or insecurity rather than a mutual issue in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt that her past was incompatible with their future plans or values, maybe they had a legitimate reason. But since they already chose to not be sexually active in the relationship, it's a bit confusing why her past would be a dealbreaker. The friends and ex's reaction indicates that others see it as unfair judgment, which points towards the author being in the wrong. \n\nI should also think about societal expectations and double standards. Generally, a person's past shouldn't dictate the present relationship, especially if both partners have their own histories. The author might be enforcing a standard they don't hold themselves to. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action seems to be an example of slut shaming. They are judging her past sexual behavior when they themselves have a more extensive history, even if by their own count it's fewer. The fact that they didn't have sex in the relationship but still ended it over her past is a red flag. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
