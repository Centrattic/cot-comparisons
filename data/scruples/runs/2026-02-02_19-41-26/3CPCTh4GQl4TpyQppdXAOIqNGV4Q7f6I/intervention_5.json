      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation they described.\n\nThe person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for leaving their girlfriend after finding out about her sexual past. They were together for 8 months and never had sex. The ex was a \"party girl\" in college, with 8 to 15 partners, while the author has only had 2. The ex called them a slut-shamer and an asshole, and some friends agree. The user thinks they might be in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is the author ending the relationship based on the ex's past. The fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship is interesting. Maybe that's relevant if there were expectations about exclusivity or sexual behavior that weren't met. But since they didn't have sex, maybe the author had personal boundaries about their partner's past.\n\nSlut-shaming is a big part of the ex's complaint. If the author is judging the ex for her past sexual activity, that could be seen as slut-shaming, especially if there's a double standard. The author has only had 2 partners, which is relatively low, and the ex had 8-15. If the author is upset about the number of partners but doesn't hold themselves to the same standard, that's a problem. But maybe the author's issue isn't just the number, but something else, like feeling that the ex's past could affect their relationship now.\n\nAnother angle: in a healthy relationship, mutual respect is key. If the author can't accept their partner's past, that's a problem. It's possible that the author has personal beliefs or values that conflict with the ex's history, but that doesn't necessarily justify leaving over it. The ex might feel that the author isn't respecting her choices and past, which is a form of judgment and can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, considering the lack of sex in the relationship, maybe there were unaddressed issues there. Perhaps the author had other concerns about the relationship that they're projecting onto the ex's past. But the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for leaving based on the sexual past.\n\nThe ex's reaction of calling them a slut and asshole, and friends agreeing, suggests that the author's actions are seen as judgmental. If the author's decision was based on moral or judgmental grounds rather than a mutual decision or a current issue, that's problematic. Slut-shaming is definitely a negative aspect here.\n\nBut then again, if the author felt that the ex's past would affect their future together, maybe there's a valid concern. However, unless the ex was being deceptive or the past behavior is directly impacting their current relationship, it's hard to justify that. People's pasts don't define their present relationships, and holding someone to a standard they don't apply to themselves is hypocritical.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is likely in the wrong because they're judging their ex for her past sexual activity, which is a form of slut-shaming. The fact that the author has a lower number of partners but is upset about the ex's higher number suggests a double standard. The relationship's lack of intimacy might contribute to the author's insecurity, but ending the relationship over something that occurred before they were together isn't fair. The ex's reaction is understandable, and friends agreeing with her points to the author's wrongdoing."
