      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with their ex because of her past number of sexual partners. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were in an 8-month relationship, never had sex. The guy found out she had a lot of partners in college (8 or 15), and he broke up with her. She says he's slut-shaming, and his friends agree. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, in relationships, being judgmental about a partner's past can be a big issue. The key points here are the man's motivation and the context. Since they never had sex themselves, the breakup is based solely on her past. That seems like he's holding onto some expectations about fidelity or purity that might not be realistic or fair, especially if they weren't in a committed relationship before. \n\nSlut-shaming is about criticizing someone for their sexual history, which is a form of judgment based on their past. Even if there's a difference in the number of partners, if he's using that as a reason to end the relationship without considering her perspective or if it's based on his own biases, that's problematic. Also, his friends calling him an asshole and a slut-shamer suggests that his reaction might be over the line.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he felt uncomfortable with her past and couldn't move past it. But the problem is that if she's not currently being unfaithful, her past shouldn't dictate the relationship's future unless there's an issue with trust or respect. Since they never had sex, it's possible he had other issues, but basing a breakup solely on past partners could be seen as unfair.\n\nI think the consensus here is that the author is in the wrong because he's judging her past and letting it affect their current relationship, which isn't his business if they're not sexually active. Plus, slut-shaming is a negative behavior. So the answer is A."
