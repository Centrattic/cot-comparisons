By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the girl because of her sexual past. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nSo, the situation: They were together for 8 months, no sex. The guy found out she had a lot of sexual partners in college (8-15) and broke up with her. He says he's not okay with her past, but she and his friends are calling him a slut-shamer and an asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of slut-shaming. That's when someone judges or criticizes another person, usually a woman, for their sexual activity. If the guy is focusing on her past number of partners while not holding himself to the same standard (he's had 2), that could be biased. The key here is whether the breakup is based on her past actions, which are consensual and in the past, and whether that's a valid reason. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, being judgmental about a partner's past can be a problem. Unless there's a specific issue like cheating or something non-consensual, the number of past partners is a personal choice. The man might have personal or religious beliefs that conflict, but acting on that by ending the relationship could be seen as unfair. Also, if he didn't have an issue with his own number of past partners (2), then the double standard might be an issue. \n\nThe fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship is also interesting. Maybe there were other issues, but the breakup reason is her past. It's possible he had trust issues or jealousy that led him to focus on her history. \n\nSlut-shaming is generally considered harmful and discriminatory. If the guy is making her feel bad about her past, that's a negative trait. His friends calling him an asshole suggests that his reaction isn't socially accepted. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because he's being judgmental and shaming her for her past, which is a personal choice and not a reason for a breakup. Unless there were other factors, like lack of trust or incompatibility, but the main reason given is her sexual history, which isn't valid.\n"
