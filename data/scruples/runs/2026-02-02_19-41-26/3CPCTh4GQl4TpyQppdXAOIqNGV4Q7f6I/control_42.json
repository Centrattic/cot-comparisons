      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her sexual past is in the wrong. The situation is that the couple was together for 8 months without having sex, and the breakup happened after he found out about her past with 8 to 15 partners. He's now being called a \"slut shamer\" and an asshole by his friends and ex. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is his decision to end the relationship based on her sexual history. In many modern contexts, this is seen as problematic because people's past sexual experiences don't typically affect a current relationship's validity unless there are specific issues like STIs, which aren't mentioned here. The fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship is also important. If he was okay with not having sex with her, maybe his issue was more about his own insecurities or societal expectations rather than something legitimate.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of slut shaming. Calling someone a \"party girl\" and breaking up over past relationships could definitely be seen as judging her for her past, which is a form of slut shaming. That's generally frowned upon as it's a controlling and misogynistic behavior. Friends and the ex saying he's an asshole might be reflecting that perspective. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if the man had clear boundaries and couldn't move past her past, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the problem is that personal boundaries can't be used to justify shaming or discrimination. Even if he felt uncomfortable, the decision to leave should be his own without making her feel judged. \n\nAlso, the length of the relationship and not having sex during that time suggests that his actions might be more about his own inability to accept her past rather than a specific issue that impacts their current relationship. It's important to distinguish between personal preferences and harmful judgments. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely violated a common social norm by judging his partner's past, leading to the breakup. Therefore, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
