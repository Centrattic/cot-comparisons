      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who left their girlfriend because of her sexual past is in the wrong. The situation is that they were in a relationship for 8 months without having sex, and the guy broke up with her after finding out she had multiple partners in college. He claims he's not a fan of her past, but friends and the ex are calling him out for slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The man hasn't had sex with his girlfriend despite being together for 8 months, which might indicate that he was abstaining for personal or religious reasons. If that's the case, then being upset about her past sexual history could be seen as hypocritical or judgmental. However, if he's comfortable with his own past but not hers, that's a double standard. \n\nSlut-shaming is generally about judging someone for their sexual behavior, which is often criticized as unfair, especially when it's used to control or look down on others. The woman's past is in the context of college, which is a common time for people to explore their sexuality. The man's reaction could be seen as holding her to a standard he doesn't hold himself to. \n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't have sex suggests that there might have been other issues in the relationship. The breakup might be a result of deeper incompatibilities rather than just her past. However, the key question is whether his reason for breaking up is valid. If he values monogamy and her past doesn't affect their current relationship, then his decision could be seen as unnecessary judgment. \n\nOn the other hand, if he genuinely felt that her past affected their compatibility or his ability to move forward, that's a personal choice. But if he's projecting his own insecurities or double standards, then he's in the wrong. The friends and ex calling him an asshole and a slut-shamer might indicate that his actions are socially frowned upon, which could support the idea that he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the man's judgment of her past, especially when he himself has a similar number of partners (2 vs. 8-15), seems like a double standard. Unless there's more context not provided, the consensus would likely be that he is in the wrong for slut-shaming her and making a decision based on her past rather than their current relationship.\n"
