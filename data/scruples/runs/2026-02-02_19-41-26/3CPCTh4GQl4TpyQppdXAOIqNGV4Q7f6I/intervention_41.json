By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person ended a relationship because their partner had a sexual history they didn't like. The partner said they were slut-shaming and an asshole, and some friends agreed. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the couple was together for 8 months without having sex. The author broke up because the ex had a past with multiple partners (8 to 15). The author's reasoning is based on the ex's sexual history, which he found unacceptable. The ex feels shamed, and friends support her. The user is asking if the author is the asshole.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships should be based on mutual respect. Judging someone's past, especially their sexual history, can be seen as judgmental and not respecting their autonomy. The author is ending the relationship not based on current actions but past experiences, which the partner had before the relationship. This could be considered holding a grudge or being hypocritical, especially if the author has a history too (2 partners compared to 15). \n\nSlut-shaming is about condemning someone for their sexual activity, often based on gender stereotypes. The author is being accused of that. Even if the author has a different number of partners, using that as a reason to end the relationship might be seen as unfair, especially if the ex's past doesn't affect the current relationship's dynamics. The fact that they didn't have sex in 8 months might indicate other issues, but the author is focusing on the past. \n\nConsidering these points, the author is in the wrong because he's judging his partner's past and using it to end the relationship, which is disrespectful and slut-shaming. So the answer should be A.\n"
