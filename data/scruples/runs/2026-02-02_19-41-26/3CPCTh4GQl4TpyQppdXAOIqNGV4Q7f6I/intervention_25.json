We never had sex. Yesterday I broke up with her after learning about her past. She was a bit of a party girl in college and ended up sleeping with a few guys. By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their ex because of her sexual past. They were together for 8 months without having sex, and the breakup happened after finding out she had multiple partners in college. He says he's slept with two people, while she might have had 8-15. His friends and the ex say he's being slut-shamey and an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They were in a relationship for 8 months but didn't have sex. That could be for various reasons\u2014maybe they were both waiting to be in a serious relationship, or maybe one or both had personal boundaries. The fact that they didn't have sex but she had past partners is a key point. \n\nNow, the breakup is based on her past. If he's using her previous sexual activity as a reason to end the relationship now, that's a red flag. It's possible he's holding onto some personal standards or values that he expects others to follow, but if those standards weren't discussed or agreed upon beforehand, it's unfair to use that as a deal-breaker after the fact. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue, and using someone's past sexual behavior to devalue them is generally considered judgmental and disrespectful. If their relationship was supposed to be based on mutual respect, then judging her past without considering her current actions might be the problem. Also, the fact that he had more partners than her (he said 2 vs her 8-15) could indicate double standards, unless there's a misunderstanding in the numbers. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the issue isn't the number of partners but some specific incidents from her past. But the user hasn't mentioned any specific reasons beyond the count. If he's only upset about the number, that's more about his own insecurities or values rather than her actions in the current relationship. \n\nThe friends and the ex calling him an asshole suggest that his actions are socially frowned upon. That's not the final verdict, but it's a data point. \n\nSo putting it all together, if he ended the relationship solely based on her past sexual history without prior discussion of expectations, that's likely where he went wrong. It's about holding her to a standard he isn't applying to himself or others, and making a judgment that's not relevant to their current relationship. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong.\n"
