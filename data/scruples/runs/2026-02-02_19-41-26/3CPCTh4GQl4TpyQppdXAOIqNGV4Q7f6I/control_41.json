      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who left their girlfriend because of her sexual past is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down. \n\nFirst, the situation: They were in a relationship for 8 months without having sex. The guy found out she had a lot of sexual partners in college\u2014like 8 to 15 guys. He broke up with her, and she accused him of slut-shaming. His friends also called him an asshole and said he was wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal values, communication, and whether it's fair to end a relationship based on past behavior. The user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA), which is a common question in those forums. \n\nSo, if someone's in a relationship for 8 months and hasn't had sex yet, maybe he had his own standards or expectations. But is it wrong to base a breakup on someone's past actions, especially if they're not current? Slut-shaming usually refers to judging someone for their current sexual behavior, not past. But where do you draw the line?\n\nOn the other hand, the fact that he didn't have sex with her but then ended things over her past might indicate some hypocrisy or double standards. Also, if he waited until after the breakup to bring this up, that could be seen as unfair. Timing matters a lot in these situations. \n\nCommunication is another factor. If he had his issues with her past and hadn't discussed them before, then using it as a reason to break up might come off as a last-minute excuse. People often change their stance after a breakup, especially if they feel rejected. \n\nFriends pointing out that he's an asshole could be a clue. Maybe they see a lack of consideration or a sudden judgment after being in a relationship for months without intimacy. \n\nBut some might argue that personal values are important. If he truly couldn't get past her past, even if it's irrelevant now, he might feel it's a dealbreaker. However, it's more about his own insecurities or expectations rather than her current behavior. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's a \"party girl\" in college might not affect their current relationship unless it's causing trust issues or other problems now. Since they didn't have sex, maybe he's projecting his own past or had different expectations. \n\nI think the main issue is that he waited until after not having sex to bring up her past. Maybe he was using her sexual history as an excuse to end the relationship, which could be seen as unfair. Plus, slut-shaming is about current behavior, so focusing on past might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because the breakup was based on her past, which isn't his to judge, and especially since they hadn't even had sex yet. It seems like he's holding onto something that's not relevant to their current relationship, and the friends' reactions support that.\n"
