By her count it's 8 guys but could be as high as 15. I've slept with 2. She said I was slut shaming and an asshole, now a few of my friends say the same thing.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because of the ex's sexual past. They were together for 8 months without having sex. The author broke up with her after finding out she had multiple partners in college, and now she and some friends are calling him a slut-shamer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether it's acceptable to break up someone over their past sexual behavior. The author is using that as the reason for the breakup. The ex had 8-15 partners, while the author had 2. The question is whether that's a valid reason to end the relationship.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, slut-shaming is a big issue. Judging someone for their past sexual activities, especially if it's not affecting the current relationship, is often seen as unfair. The author is making a judgment based on her history, which is something she can't change. If the author had values that he wasn't comfortable with, maybe it's better to address that earlier, but using her past as the reason after 8 months seems like a way to avoid taking personal responsibility. \n\nAlso, the fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship is interesting. Maybe there were other issues that the author is avoiding by blaming her past. The friends labeling him as an asshole suggests that his actions are not socially accepted. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that personal boundaries are a valid reason. If someone can't be with someone with a different number of past partners, then maybe it's their right to choose. But the key here is that the breakup is based on her past, which is irrelevant to their current relationship's viability unless it's causing real issues (like STIs, but that's not mentioned here). \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. He's using slut-shaming as a reason, which is disrespectful. The answer should be A.\n"
