      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her past number of sexual partners is in the wrong. First, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe man and his girlfriend were together for 8 months without having sex. He broke up with her because she had 8 to 15 sexual partners in college, while he had only 2. He's being called a slut-shamer by his friends and the ex. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the reasons for the breakup. He's judging her past sexual behavior, which is a common issue in relationships. The fact that they didn't have sex during their relationship suggests maybe there were other issues, like differing sexual preferences or readiness. But he's choosing to end the relationship based on her past, not their current dynamics.\n\nSlut-shaming is a big red flag. Judging someone's past partners can be seen as hypocritical or unfair, especially if the person isn't holding the same standard for themselves or their partner. The man had two partners compared to her eight to fifteen. That's a significant difference. If he's okay with his own past but not hers, that's a two-faced approach. \n\nAlso, if they didn't have sex in 8 months, maybe there were underlying issues like his own readiness for intimacy, anxiety, or other factors. Using her past as the reason for the breakup might be a way to avoid addressing their own relationship problems. \n\nThe friends calling him an asshole and a slut-shamer suggest that his actions are socially frowned upon. People often criticize double standards in relationships. If he's not willing to accept her past but is okay with his own, that's a flaw in his reasoning. \n\nBut then again, personal boundaries matter. If he felt that her past was a dealbreaker for him, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, the way he handled it\u2014judging her and then being surprised at the backlash\u2014might be the issue. It's possible he should have communicated his feelings instead of breaking up abruptly, but the main point is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn most cases, judging a partner's past without considering their current behavior or their openness about it is problematic. The fact that she was honest about her past (even if the number is a range) shows she was upfront. If he couldn't handle that, maybe the breakup was his choice, but the judgmental attitude makes him the AITA. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's holding a double standard and slut-shaming, which is generally frowned upon. Even if he had reasons, the way he acted aligns with the behaviors his friends are criticizing."
