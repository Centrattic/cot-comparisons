      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his ex-girlfriend after finding out about her sexual past. They were together for 8 months and never had sex. The ex had 8-15 partners in college, while he's had 2. His friends and the ex are saying he's a jerk for breaking up over that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are the reasons behind the breakup. The author is upset about her past, but they didn't have a relationship where they were exclusive or had set boundaries about sexual history. If he didn't have a problem with his own past (2 partners), why does her past matter? That might be a double standard. Also, breaking up after 8 months over something that happened in her past, especially if it's not affecting their current relationship, could be seen as holding a grudge or being judgmental. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue. If he's judging her for her past sexual behavior without her current actions affecting their relationship, that's problematic. The fact that she was a \"party girl in college\" might not be relevant if they are no longer in college and she's not engaging in that behavior now. The breakup seems based on her past, not her present actions, which could be unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, people do have different values. If he has strong personal beliefs about sexual history, maybe he's justified. But the problem is that he's only just breaking up now after 8 months. If that was a deal-breaker from the start, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. Also, the fact that he's comparing their numbers (he has 2, she has 8-15) suggests a judgment based on quantity, which is a common issue in slut-shaming. \n\nThe friends and the ex calling him an asshole probably because his reaction is disproportionate. Unless there were other issues in the relationship, breaking up solely over her past sexual history without considering her current behavior or their relationship's context is likely seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's being judgmental about her past in a way that's not constructive or fair. It's about her past, not her present, and there's no indication she was unfaithful or that the past behavior affects their current relationship negatively. Holding that against her after 8 months and not having had sex themselves complicates things further, as it might reflect his own insecurities or double standards.\n"
