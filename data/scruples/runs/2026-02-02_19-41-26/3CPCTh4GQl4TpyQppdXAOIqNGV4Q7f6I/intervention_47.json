      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her sexual past. Here's the situation: they were together for 8 months without having sex, and he found out she had 8-15 partners in college, while he had 2. She calls him a slut-shamer and an asshole, and his friends agree. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points are the reason for the breakup and the societal norms around relationships. The author is ending the relationship based on the number of past sexual partners, which is a common issue in AITA posts. \n\nSlut-shaming is generally frowned upon because it judges someone's past actions, often unfairly, especially if those actions are consensual and in the past. The fact that they didn't have sex during their 8-month relationship might indicate that the author had personal boundaries or expectations about sexual history. However, holding past consensual actions against someone can be seen as judgmental. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that the breakup is due to her past, which is something she has no control over now. If the author couldn't accept her past, maybe they should have discussed this earlier. The author's friends also think he's in the wrong, suggesting that his reaction is not socially accepted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that his values or personal boundaries were important to him, and the breakup was about incompatibility. But the issue is whether it's reasonable to end a relationship over someone's past sexual history, especially if it's not affecting the current relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication about expectations is crucial. If the author had values against being with someone with a certain number of past partners, that should have been discussed before getting into a long-term relationship. Using that as a reason to break up after 8 months might indicate that he didn't address his own issues or communicated his expectations properly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's judging his ex's past consensual choices and using that as a reason for the breakup, which is a common AITA scenario where the person is considered the asshole for being judgmental. The fact that his friends and the ex agree he's in the wrong supports that view. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
