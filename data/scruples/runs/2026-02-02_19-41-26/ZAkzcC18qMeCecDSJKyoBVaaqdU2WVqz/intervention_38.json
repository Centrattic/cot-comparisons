This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend called off their wedding, cheated on her, and isn't contributing to the household. She feels overwhelmed with work and responsibilities, and he's blaming her for ruining his dreams if she kicks him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The user is handling all the domestic responsibilities while he's busy with school and dance. He's not paying rent, only groceries. When confronted about the cheating, he gave excuses and even broke his phone. Now, he's threatening that she'd ruin his future if she leaves him because he can't afford to move out.\n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong for considering ending the relationship. From an ethical standpoint, cheating is a significant issue, and the boyfriend isn't taking responsibility. His excuses are dismissive and harmful. The user is justified in feeling used and drained. The boyfriend is using the fact that he's a student and can't afford to move out as leverage, but that doesn't excuse his behavior. \n\nHowever, one might argue that she has a responsibility to be supportive of his dreams, but when he's actively cheating and not contributing, his dreams shouldn't take precedence over her well-being. The user's mental health and autonomy are important. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many, and she's within her rights to leave him without feeling guilty. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that she's ruining his dreams is self-serving. His actions (cheating, not contributing) have already damaged the relationship. The user isn't obligated to support someone who has betrayed her trust and isn't pulling their weight. It's his responsibility to find a solution for his housing if he's in a position where he can't support himself. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is not in the wrong. Her boyfriend's actions are the primary issue. She's right to prioritize her own needs and well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, she is not in the wrong).\n"
