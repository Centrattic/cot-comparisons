This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering kicking out her boyfriend after he cheated and caused a lot of issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together almost 3 years, had a planned wedding that the boyfriend called off, which led to conflicts and therapy. Now, the boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy workload, but he's not contributing to household chores. The author is handling all the cooking, cleaning, etc., while working full-time and teaching. Then he cheated, gave poor excuses, and when confronted, he broke his phone and blamed her. She feels drained and wants to kick him out but is worried about ruining his future because he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home, potentially affecting his career.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nCheating is a major betrayal. The boyfriend's actions were wrong, and his excuses are dismissive and hurtful. The author is justified in feeling hurt and betrayed. She's also taking on all the domestic responsibilities while he's focusing on his studies, which is unfair. The fact that he can't contribute even the basics (trash, dishes, laundry) adds to the imbalance.\n\nHowever, the dilemma is whether she's being unfair by not letting him stay. He can't afford to move out and would have to go far from his school and his dream. The author is in a tough spot because she wants to protect herself but also doesn't want to ruin his future. But is she in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the boyfriend has already made choices (cheating) that caused harm. The author is not obligated to support him after that. If he's truly in a position where he can't leave, maybe it's not her responsibility to keep him housed. She's already contributing significantly to his needs (groceries, etc.), and he's not meeting his end. The cheating and excuses show a lack of respect for her. So, she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship, even if it affects his future. He made his bed by cheating and not maintaining the relationship properly.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a way to handle this without kicking him out immediately, like seeking more counseling or setting boundaries. But given the circumstances, she's exhausted and deserves to prioritize her mental health. The boyfriend's argument that she's ruining his dreams seems self-centered, as his actions have already compromised the relationship. His career shouldn't be prioritized over her well-being after his betrayal.\n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014she is not in the wrong. She's justified in protecting herself after his actions.\n"
