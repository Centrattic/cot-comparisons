This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The author's boyfriend cheated, called off the wedding, and is now using his dance career as a reason not to leave the relationship.\n\nFirst, the cheating is a major issue. Cheating is generally considered a betrayal, and the author is justified in feeling hurt and wanting to end things. The boyfriend's excuses for cheating seem pretty bad\u2014saying things like the other woman is skinny and that he wants to stay friends with her are not acceptable. The author found out about the cheating, confronted him, and he broke his phone, then blamed her for making him anxious. That's not healthy behavior.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that if the author kicks him out, it would ruin his dreams. He's a dance major, and he can't afford to move out. But the author is supporting the relationship financially, doing all the chores, and teaching while he's focusing on his dance classes. It seems like he's not taking responsibility for his actions. He's using his career as an excuse to avoid accountability, both for cheating and for not contributing to the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective: she's been in a relationship that's become toxic. She's overworked, exhausted, and feeling drained. Her partner isn't pulling his weight, and his cheating has caused emotional damage. The fact that he's using his career as a shield to avoid consequences might be self-serving. The author isn't the one cheating here. She's the one who's been cheated on and is trying to set boundaries. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong for \"ruining his dreams\" by possibly ending the relationship. If ending the relationship is necessary for her well-being, then she's not in the wrong. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many people, and she has the right to prioritize her own mental health. The boyfriend's dreams shouldn't be a reason to stay in a harmful relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that she could be overreacting, especially if she's considering kick him out without a place to go. But given the cheating and his lack of accountability, his well-being isn't the only concern here. The author has her own life and needs to take care of herself. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the ones that caused the problem. The question is about her responsibility for ending the relationship, but since he cheated and isn't taking responsibility, she's justified in wanting to leave. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
