This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who cheated and is causing a lot of stress. The author is considering ending the relationship, which would impact his studies and career, but also feels overburdened.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. They've been together almost three years, had a wedding planned but he called it off. Then they tried therapy but things got worse. He's a dance major with a heavy schedule, and the author is handling most of the chores while working and studying. He cheated, gave bad excuses, and even broke his phone. He's now threatening to say she's ruining his dreams if she kicks him out.\n\nThe key points here are the infidelity, the lack of responsibility on his part, the emotional manipulation (like blaming her for his actions), and his inability to take care of himself financially. The author is not only dealing with the emotional trauma of cheating but also physical and emotional exhaustion from shouldering all the household duties.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems selfish and inconsiderate. Cheating is a major violation, and his excuses make it worse. He's using his financial situation as an excuse not to leave, but the author isn't responsible for supporting him. His threats about ruining his dreams ignore the fact that his actions have already compromised their relationship and his own credibility.\n\nThe author is standing up for her own well-being, which is valid. She's not obligated to support someone who's been unfaithful and hasn't contributed to the relationship. His claim that he'd be homeless is his responsibility to handle, not hers. The fact that he has a poor relationship with his father adds to the complexity, but it's his life to manage.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the boyfriend's actions have caused harm. The author is justified in prioritizing her own mental health and future. The question is whether ending the relationship would be the right choice, and based on the information, it seems he's the one in the wrong for cheating and not taking responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering cutting ties.\n"
