This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering ruining her boyfriend's dreams after he cheated. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author is already dealing with the aftermath of a broken engagement and a lot of stress from their relationship dynamics. He's a dance major with a heavy schedule, but his behavior is problematic\u2014he doesn't contribute to household chores and then blames her when confronted about cheating. His excuses are really insincere and hurtful, like saying he's not attracted to her anymore because of her weight, which is especially sensitive given her recovery from anorexia.\n\nThe author is taking care of all the domestic responsibilities, working, and teaching, which is a lot. She's feeling drained and used. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is in a position where he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home, which might not be a supportive environment given his dad is referred to as a \"POS.\" He's using his financial situation and future as leverage against her, saying she'd ruin his dreams if she kicks him out.\n\nNow, considering cheating is a serious issue that often justifies ending a relationship. The boyfriend's actions have already damaged trust and commitment. The author is standing up for herself and her needs, which is valid. The boyfriend's focus on his own career and future is problematic, especially since he's contributed to the relationship's breakdown through his infidelity and lack of support. The author isn't the one who violated the relationship's terms; he did. Her considering ending the relationship to protect her own well-being isn't wrong. The fact that he's using his situation as a reason to stay might be a form of manipulation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's dealing with the consequences of his actions and trying to reclaim her happiness. His dreams don't outweigh her right to be in a respectful and supportive relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
