This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend cheated, is using up all the author's time with his dance commitments, and she's taking care of all the household chores while he doesn't contribute. The boyfriend is also making excuses for cheating and now is threatening to blame her if she kicks him out, saying it would ruin his dreams.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend called off the wedding, then they tried therapy but it didn't work. Now he's overcommitted to his dance major, leading to him not helping with chores. The author is handling all responsibilities, which is causing her stress. Then he cheated, and when confronted, he gave poor excuses. Now she wants to end the relationship but he says she'd ruin his life by forcing him to move back home.\n\nSo, the author is torn between her well-being and his future. She's doing all the work, he's not contributing, and he cheated. The cheating is a major betrayal. His excuses are weak and dismissive. He's also being manipulative by saying she's ruining his dreams if she leaves, which shifts blame onto her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's actions (cheating, not contributing, manipulative behavior) are clearly wrong. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to end a toxic relationship where she's being overworked and disrespected. His arguments about ruining his dreams ignore his own responsibilities and the damage he's done. Ending the relationship is about her own well-being and safety, not just about him. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
