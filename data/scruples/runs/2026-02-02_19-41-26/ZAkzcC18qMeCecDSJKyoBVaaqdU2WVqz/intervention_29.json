This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cheated and is now relying on the author to support him financially and with household duties while pursuing his dance career.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend called off the wedding a year before it was supposed to happen. That's a significant event. Then, after a breakup, they went to therapy, but things didn't improve. Now, he's taking a lot of dance classes and performances, which leaves him too exhausted to contribute to chores. The author is handling all the household responsibilities, working part-time, and dealing with the emotional stress of the cheating. \n\nThe cheating itself is a major betrayal. The boyfriend's excuses for cheating are dismissive and hurtful, especially mentioning the author's weight issues during her recovery from anorexia. That adds emotional abuse to the mix. When confronted, he makes excuses and even blames her for breaking his phone. \n\nThe author feels drained, used, and wants to end the relationship, but the boyfriend claims she would ruin his dreams if she kicks him out. He's in a position where he can't afford to leave and would have to move back with his father. The author is in a tough spot because she's supporting him financially and emotionally, but he's not contributing equally. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the boyfriend's actions\u2014cheating, lack of support, and making excuses\u2014show a lack of respect and responsibility. The author isn't the one who cheated; she's the one trying to hold the relationship together despite his actions. She's also struggling with her own health issues (recovering from anorexia), which the boyfriend is using as a reason to justify his behavior. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. Since he cheated, isn't contributing, and is in a position where he can't support himself financially, the author isn't at fault for prioritizing her own well-being. Ending the relationship in this case is self-preservation, not ruin. His dreams don't justify her staying in a toxic situation where she's being used and emotionally abused.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
