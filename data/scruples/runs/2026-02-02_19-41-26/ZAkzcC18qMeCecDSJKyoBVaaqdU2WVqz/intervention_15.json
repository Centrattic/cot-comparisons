This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. The boyfriend cheated, called off the wedding, and is not contributing much to household responsibilities. The author is overwhelmed with work, school, and taking care of everything else. The boyfriend argues that if she kicks him out, he'd be homeless and it would ruin his dreams. The author is conflicted between her own well-being and his future.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. The boyfriend gave various excuses, which don't seem valid. The author is clearly hurt and has been doing most of the work. On the other hand, the boyfriend's financial situation is dire if he leaves. But he also has the means to move back home, even if it's two hours away. The author isn't necessarily making him homeless; he has options, albeit not ideal ones. \n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility. The boyfriend isn't pulling his weight in the relationship. The author is supporting him financially and emotionally, but he's not reciprocating. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many people. The fact that he's being defensive and shifting blame (like breaking his phone and blaming the author) shows a lack of accountability.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself after being wronged. The boyfriend made poor choices, and the author is recognizing that continuing the relationship is unhealthy. Ending a relationship where one person has cheated and isn't taking responsibility isn't the fault of the one ending it. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
