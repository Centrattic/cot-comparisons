This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the boyfriend called off the wedding, cheated, and is now struggling with the decision to end the relationship because it might ruin his future as a dancer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author is doing all the household chores, working, and teaching while he's taking on a heavy academic load. But when she confronts him about the cheating, he gives excuses and even breaks his phone. He also says she's ruining his dreams if she kicks him out because he can't afford to move.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author wants to end the relationship because of the cheating, but feels guilty because it might affect his career. However, the cheating is a significant factor here. The boyfriend's behavior seems to be the primary issue\u2014cheating, giving poor excuses, and not taking responsibility. The author is trying to maintain the relationship despite his actions, maybe out of a sense of responsibility or guilt, but it's clear she's being overwhelmed and taken advantage of.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the boyfriend's actions (cheating, excuses) are morally wrong. The author is responding to being wronged. Ending a relationship after cheating is generally considered justified. The author isn't the one who broke off the wedding first; he did. She's now faced with the consequences of his actions. The argument that she's ruining his dreams might be a way for him to avoid accountability. Her decision to end the relationship is a response to his betrayal and lack of responsibility. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's trying to take care of herself after being betrayed and overburdened. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
