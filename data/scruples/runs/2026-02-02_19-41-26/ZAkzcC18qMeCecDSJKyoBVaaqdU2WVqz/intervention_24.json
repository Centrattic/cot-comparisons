This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cheated, called off the wedding, and is now not contributing to household responsibilities. The author is considering kicking him out but feels conflicted because it might ruin his dreams of becoming a professional dancer. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author confronted him and he gave excuses, which shows a lack of accountability. He also broke his phone after being asked to block the other woman, blaming the author for making him anxious. That seems like emotional manipulation. The author is doing all the chores, working, and managing school, while the boyfriend is using his studies as an excuse for not contributing. The author is considering ending the relationship to protect his career, but the boyfriend claims he can't leave because he can't afford to move out.\n\nThe key points here are the cheating, the lack of accountability, the emotional manipulation, and the unequal distribution of responsibilities. The author is the one trying to maintain the relationship and support the boyfriend, even after the betrayal. The boyfriend's actions (cheating, excuses, blaming the author) suggest he's in the wrong. The author's dilemma is about whether it's right to prioritize ending the relationship despite the consequences for the boyfriend. But since the boyfriend is the one who cheated and is not taking responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own well-being. The boyfriend's dreams shouldn't be prioritized over the author's emotional and physical well-being. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
