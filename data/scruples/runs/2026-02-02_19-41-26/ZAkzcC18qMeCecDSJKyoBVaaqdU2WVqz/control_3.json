This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. The author's boyfriend cheated, called off the wedding, and is now taking on a lot of dance classes and work, which leaves him too exhausted to handle chores. The author is doing all the cooking, cleaning, etc., while also managing her own school and job. The boyfriend gives excuses for cheating, like not finding her attractive anymore, and even broke his phone after being asked to block the other woman. Now the author wants to kick him out but feels guilty because he might become homeless and his career as a dancer could be ruined. The question is if the author is in the wrong for considering this.\n\nFirst, cheating is a major betrayal. The boyfriend broke trust, which is a serious issue. The author has been supporting him financially, doing all the housework, and is working part-time. He's not contributing his share. The excuses he gives for cheating are really poor, especially mentioning her weight and not finding the author attractive\u2014since she's recovering from anorexia, that's especially hurtful. The fact that he's making her feel guilty by saying she's ruining his dreams seems like a manipulation tactic. People often do that to avoid taking responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, he might be in a tough spot financially and would have to move back in with his dad. But is the author responsible for that? He made choices, including cheating, which led to the current situation. The author is not obligated to support someone who has betrayed her and isn't pulling their weight. The fact that he's using his career as an excuse doesn't absolve him. The author's well-being is important too. She's been drained and used, which is valid. Ending the relationship or asking him to leave isn't necessarily her fault, especially given his actions. So, the answer is probably B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions justify her considering leaving, and she isn't obligated to sacrifice her own mental health and life for his mistakes.\n"
