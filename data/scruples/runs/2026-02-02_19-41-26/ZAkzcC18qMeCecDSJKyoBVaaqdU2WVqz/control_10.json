This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend cheated on her. He called off their wedding a year before, they had therapy, but things didn't work out. Now the boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy workload, but he's not contributing to household chores. The author is doing all the cooking, cleaning, etc., while also working and studying. Then the cheating happened, and when confronted, the boyfriend gave excuses and even broke his phone. The boyfriend says if she kicks him out, he'd be homeless and his dreams of being a professional dancer would be ruined. The author feels drained and wants to kick him out but is conflicted because of his situation.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated. That's a major breach of trust in a relationship. The author is justified in feeling hurt and wanting to end the relationship. The boyfriend's excuses for cheating, like finding the other girl attractive because she's skinny and implying the author isn't attractive anymore, are really poor and show a lack of respect. Also, the fact that he kept the friend contact and even had the other girl show up at their school without knowing she's his girlfriend is problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend is using his financial situation as leverage, saying he can't move out because he has no money and would have to go back to his dad's house. But that doesn't mean the author is responsible for his living situation. He's a college student, so he's supposed to manage his own finances. The author is paying rent and bills, and the boyfriend only contributes to groceries. She's doing all the domestic work too, which is unfair. The author is working part-time, going to school, and handling the chores, which adds to her stress.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling used and drained. She's in a position where she's supporting both their lives financially and domestically, which isn't balanced. Even if she kicked him out, he would have to deal with his own consequences, but that's his responsibility. The fact that he's blaming her for his anxiety and embarrassment when confronting the cheating is also a red flag. He's not taking accountability.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions (cheating, lack of contribution, excuses) are the main issues here. The author is right to feel that she's being taken advantage of and that her needs aren't being met. She's not obligated to support someone who has betrayed her and isn't contributing to the relationship. The fact that he's a student doesn't absolve him of his responsibilities in the relationship. The author has every right to prioritize her well-being and end the relationship if she feels it's necessary for her mental health.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
