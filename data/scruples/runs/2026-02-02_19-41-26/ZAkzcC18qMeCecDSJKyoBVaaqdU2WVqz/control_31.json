This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their boyfriend cheated, and they're considering kicking him out, which would ruin his dreams as a dancer. They're asking if they'd be in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated on them. Cheating is a major betrayal in a relationship. The user is the one who's been handling most of the household responsibilities while he's busy with school and dance. They even mention that he doesn't contribute much financially. So they feel used and drained. \n\nHe called off the wedding, then they tried therapy but it didn't work. Then he cheated, and when confronted, he gave excuses like not finding the user attractive anymore and wanting to stay friends with the cheater. That's pretty bad behavior. He also broke his phone when asked to block the cheater and blamed the user for making him anxious. That sounds like he's not taking responsibility for his actions.\n\nThe user is considering kicking him out because they can't handle the emotional and physical strain anymore. The boyfriend argues that he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home, which would ruin his career. But the user is worried about ruining his life by doing so.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship. From an ethical standpoint, the boyfriend's actions (cheating, not contributing, emotional manipulation) are the main issues. The user has every right to prioritize their own well-being. Ending a relationship where there's been betrayal and one-sided effort isn't the fault of the one leaving. The user isn't necessarily \"ruining\" his dreams by holding him accountable for his actions. His career challenges are a result of his own choices and the responsibilities he's taking on without supporting the relationship properly.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for themselves after being mistreated and are considering breaking up to protect their own mental health, which is a valid choice.\n"
