This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend cheated, she's been handling most of the household responsibilities while he's a dance major with a heavy workload, and she's considering kicking him out but he claims it would ruin his dreams. She's wondering if she's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Cheating is a major betrayal, and the boyfriend's excuses sound pretty bad. He gave reasons like not finding her attractive anymore and wanting to stay friends with the other woman. Those are pretty weak justifications. The fact that he broke his phone when she asked him to block her and then blamed her for making him anxious seems to show he's not taking responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's argument is that he can't move out and would have to go back home, which is 2 hours away. He's a senior in college, so his career goals might be affected if he has to leave school. The user is struggling with the idea that ending the relationship might ruin his future, but she also feels used and emotionally drained. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for potentially ruining his life. But considering that he cheated and is not taking responsibility for his actions, the author isn't the one at fault. Cheating is a significant issue that can justify ending a relationship. The boyfriend's claims about his future depend on his own choices. If he made poor decisions, like cheating and not managing responsibilities, then the consequences might be on him. The author is justified in prioritizing her own well-being after being treated poorly.\n\nAlso, she's handling all the household duties while he's busy with school. That imbalance, combined with cheating, makes it a two-fold problem. She's not wrong for wanting to end a relationship that's causing her distress. The boyfriend's future is his responsibility, especially since he's the one who violated trust and didn't meet his responsibilities in the relationship. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
