This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that she's been with her boyfriend for three years, they were going to get married but he called it off. Then things went downhill, they had fights and therapy, but it didn't help. Now he's a dance major, taking a lot of classes and doing performances, which leaves him with no time for work or responsibilities at home. She's handling all the chores, cooking, cleaning, etc., while also going to school and teaching 15 hours a week. Then he cheated on her with various excuses, like not finding her attractive anymore. When she confronted him, he blamed her for making him break his phone. She's considering kicking him out but feels guilty because it would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer since he can't afford to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is at fault here. The boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. His excuses are really poor, like saying he likes her because she's skinny and implying the author isn't attractive anymore. He also expects her to just stop him from cheating, which is not her responsibility. Additionally, he doesn't contribute to household responsibilities, and when confronted, he blames her. The author is taking on all the domestic responsibilities, which is unfair. The boyfriend is using his financial situation as a reason not to leave, but he's also not contributing to the household except for groceries. The author is the one paying rent and bills, which is a significant burden. \n\nCheating is a serious issue, and the boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of respect and accountability. He's shifting blame onto her for his actions, like breaking his phone and claiming she made him anxious. The author is in a stressful situation, handling multiple responsibilities while he's not pulling his weight. The key points here are the betrayal through cheating, his failure to take responsibility, and the imbalance in household duties.\n\nThe author is considering ending the relationship, which could be seen as a justified response to the cheating and the emotional/physical labor imbalance. However, she feels guilty about potentially ruining his career because he can't afford to leave. But he's the one who's caused the problem by cheating and not taking responsibility. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect her own well-being and leaving a situation where she's being taken advantage of. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions are clearly wrong. The author is not in the wrong for standing up for herself and taking steps to leave a harmful and imbalanced relationship. Even though she's aware of the consequences for him, she's not responsible for his choices. The fact that she's been supporting him financially and managing the household while he's not contributing adequately adds to the imbalance. The cheating is the final straw, and her decision to end the relationship is a reasonable response to his ongoing issues.\n"
