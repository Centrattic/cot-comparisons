This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering kicking out her boyfriend after he cheated and is now avoiding responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated. Cheating is a major breach of trust in a relationship. That alone gives the author a strong reason to end the relationship. The boyfriend also called off their wedding, which might indicate he wasn't serious about the future, leading to further conflict. \n\nHe's a dance major, taking on a lot of classes and performances, but the author is handling all the chores, working full-time, teaching, and paying the bills. His behavior is neglectful, contributing to the imbalance in the relationship. When confronted about cheating, his excuses are dismissive and hurtful. The fact that he blamed her for making him anxious when she asked him to block the other woman shows a lack of accountability.\n\nThe author feels drained and used. She's supporting him financially and emotionally, but he's not contributing. The boyfriend's argument that she'd ruin his dreams by kicking him out is weak because he's already in a position where he can't support himself financially, which he should have addressed before getting into this situation. \n\nCheating is a significant factor here. It's not just about the act itself but the emotional betrayal and manipulation. The boyfriend's excuses and lack of responsibility make it clear that he's not taking her feelings or the situation seriously. The author's desire to end the relationship is a reasonable response to his actions. She's not the one who's in the wrong; she's standing up for herself after being wronged.\n\nConsidering all these points, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in wanting to end the relationship given his cheating, lack of responsibility, and invalid excuses. The boyfriend's situation is a result of his own choices, and the author isn't at fault for protecting her well-being.\n"
