This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author's boyfriend cheated, and she's considering kicking him out, but he argues that it would ruin his dreams of becoming a professional dancer.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend and girlfriend have been together for three years, had a planned wedding that was called off, then went to therapy. The boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy schedule, which affects his ability to contribute to household chores. The author is handling most of the domestic responsibilities and financial support. The cheating incident happened, and when confronted, the boyfriend gave excuses. Now, the author is considering ending the relationship, but the boyfriend claims it would ruin his career as he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home. The author is conflicted because she feels used and wants to end things, but she's worried about the impact on his future.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's the case. The main ethical consideration here is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship despite the consequences for her boyfriend. \n\nCheating is a significant betrayal, and in many contexts, it's considered a valid reason to end a relationship. The boyfriend's excuses and continued contact with the other woman also suggest a lack of accountability. The author is taking on most of the domestic and financial responsibilities, which adds to her stress and sense of being exploited. However, the boyfriend's argument is that ending the relationship would disrupt his career and future, which he's invested in. \n\nBut is the author obligated to prioritize his career over her own well-being? The boyfriend's actions have already caused harm, and he's not taking full responsibility. The author has the right to prioritize her own mental health and not stay in a relationship where she's being taken advantage of. The fact that he might face financial hardship is unfortunate, but it's a consequence of his decisions, including the cheating and not contributing adequately to the relationship. \n\nThe user might be suggesting that the author is being selfish by ending the relationship, but considering the boyfriend's betrayal and lack of support, it's more about self-respect and setting boundaries. The author isn't obligated to let someone stay in her home if they're not contributing and have been unfaithful. The boyfriend's dream of being a dancer is a personal goal, but it doesn't outweigh the author's need for a respectful and balanced relationship. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in ending the relationship given the cheating and the imbalance in their living situation. The boyfriend's potential hardship is a result of his own actions, and the author has the right to make decisions that protect her well-being.\n"
