This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a cheating boyfriend who's causing a lot of stress and imbalance in their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend called off the wedding, then they tried therapy but it didn't work. Now he's taking a lot of dance classes and volunteer work, leading to him being exhausted and not helping around the house. The author is handling all the chores, working, and studying. Then he cheated with excuses that are pretty hurtful. When confronted, he broke his phone and blamed her for making him anxious. She wants to kick him out but feels she would be ruining his career and future.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Why would the author be in the wrong? Maybe because he's a dancer, and she's giving up her own well-being to support him? But he's the one who cheated and is not contributing. Wait, the user's own analysis is that the author (the person in the post) is in the wrong. But that seems counterintuitive because the boyfriend is cheating and not contributing. But maybe the user is considering that she's using his inability to move out as an excuse to stay in a bad situation? Wait, no, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is the person who would be kicking him out. The user is saying the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n\nThe boyfriend's actions are clearly wrong: cheating, excuses, not contributing, emotional manipulation. The author is taking care of everything else, and wants to end the relationship. The key here is whether the author is wrong for doing that. The boyfriend is using his financial instability and career to guilt-trip her into staying. But she's also in a position where she's being used and her health might be suffering, especially with her recovering from anorexia.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think that the author is being selfish by breaking his dreams. But the boyfriend's actions have already ruined the wedding and the relationship. Cheating is a major betrayal. So, the author is standing up for herself after being wronged. She's not in the wrong for ending the relationship, especially after his cheating and lack of support. The boyfriend's future is his own responsibility, and he made bad choices. The author isn't obligated to support him after he cheated. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
