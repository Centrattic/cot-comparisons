This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for considering kicking out her boyfriend who cheated. Let me go through the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend called off the wedding, which is a big deal. Then they went to therapy but things didn't improve. Now, she's handling all the household responsibilities while he's busy with dance classes and commitments. He's not contributing around the house, and he cheated. When confronted, his excuses are pretty bad, like not finding her attractive anymore and wanting to stay friends with the cheater. He even broke his phone after she made him block her, blaming her for his anxiety.\n\nShe's the one paying most of the bills and rent, while he only covers groceries. She's considering kicking him out because she's exhausted and he's being unfaithful, but he says she'd ruin his dreams of being a dancer since he can't afford to move out. The question is whether she's wrong to do that.\n\nWell, cheating is a major betrayal. The boyfriend's excuses are manipulative. He's using his situation to guilt-trip her into staying. She's clearly the one who's overworked and emotionally drained. By leaving him, she's protecting herself and ending a toxic situation. His financial dependence isn't her responsibility; she's not obligated to support his dreams when he's violated trust and is unfaithful. So, he's the one at fault here. The author isn't wrong for wanting to end this. Answer B.\n"
