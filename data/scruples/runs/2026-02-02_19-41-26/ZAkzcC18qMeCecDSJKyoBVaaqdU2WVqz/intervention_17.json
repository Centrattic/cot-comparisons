This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering ruining her boyfriend's dreams because he cheated. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for three years, got engaged but called it off. They tried therapy but things didn't improve. The boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy workload, leading to him not contributing much to household chores. The author is handling almost all the domestic responsibilities while working and studying. Then he cheated, gave poor excuses, and when confronted, he blamed her for breaking his phone and being homeless if she kicks him out.\n\nThe key points here are the cheating and the imbalance in their relationship. Cheating is a major betrayal, and the boyfriend's excuses seem dismissive and self-centered. The author is considering ending the relationship, which would impact his career as a dancer due to financial constraints. However, his cheating and lack of accountability are significant factors.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. I need to evaluate if the author is justified. From a moral standpoint, cheating is a serious issue, and the boyfriend's behavior (cheating, excuses, not contributing to the relationship) indicates he's not taking responsibility. The author prioritizing her own well-being and recognizing the emotional and physical drain makes sense. His argument that she's ruining his dreams might be valid, but his actions (cheating, not contributing) are the root cause of the problems.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave a relationship where she's been mistreated and is shouldering all responsibilities. The boyfriend's choices led to his current predicament. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
