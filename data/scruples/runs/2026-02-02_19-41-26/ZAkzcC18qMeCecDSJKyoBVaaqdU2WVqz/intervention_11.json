This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the boyfriend cheated and now the author is considering ending the relationship, which could affect his career and housing. The user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend called off the wedding, which is a major life decision. Then he cheated, which is a significant breach of trust. The author is handling most of the household responsibilities while the boyfriend is overextended with school and dance, leading to neglect. The cheating was followed by poor excuses and a lack of accountability. Now, the author wants to end the relationship but feels conflicted because it might ruin his career as a dancer, as he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate that. From a moral standpoint, cheating is a serious issue. The boyfriend's actions led to the wedding cancellation, then cheating, and then not taking responsibility. The author is justifiably upset and considering ending the relationship to protect their own well-being. The boyfriend's argument that the author is ruining his dreams seems to place blame on her for his own failures, such as the cheating and not managing his responsibilities.\n\nIn many relationships, trust is foundational. Cheating typically leads to the end of a relationship unless there's genuine remorse and effort to rebuild trust. The boyfriend's response to the cheating\u2014making excuses and not taking responsibility\u2014suggests a lack of remorse. The author is prioritizing her own health and safety by considering leaving, especially since the boyfriend is relying on her financially and emotionally, which is a one-sided dynamic.\n\nThe boyfriend's inability to handle the situation maturely, like breaking his phone and blaming the author for his anxiety, shows poor emotional control. The author is not in the wrong for standing up for herself and recognizing the toxic pattern. Ending the relationship isn't about ruining his dreams but about refusing to be part of a harmful cycle. The boyfriend's career issues stem from his own choices, not the author's decision to end things.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). She's ending a relationship where the other person has cheated and isn't taking responsibility, which is a valid reason. The boyfriend's situation is a result of his actions, and she's choosing to protect herself.\n"
