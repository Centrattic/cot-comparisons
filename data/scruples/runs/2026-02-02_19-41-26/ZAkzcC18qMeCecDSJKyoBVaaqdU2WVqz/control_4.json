This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they would be in the wrong for \"ruining\" their boyfriend's dreams because he cheated. The boyfriend called off their wedding, they've been in therapy but things didn't improve, and now he's cheating. The boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy schedule, but the author is handling all the household responsibilities while working and studying. The cheating has led to a confrontation where he gave excuses, including not finding her attractive anymore and wanting to stay friends with the cheater. He even broke his phone in an argument and blamed her. The author feels drained and wants to kick him out, but he claims he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home, which is 2 hours away. The author is conflicted because ending the relationship might harm his career as a dancer but she's also exhausted and used.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. Cheating is generally considered a betrayal in a relationship. The boyfriend's actions (cheating, giving excuses, not taking responsibility) are significant. The author is trying to hold him accountable by setting boundaries. His argument that she's ruining his dreams if she leaves might be a manipulation tactic. She's already doing most of the work, both in the household and financially. The fact that he can't leave because of financial reasons doesn't absolve him of his actions. The author is in a difficult position where she's trying to protect her well-being while he's not taking responsibility. \n\nI think the boyfriend is the one in the wrong for cheating and not contributing. The author is justified in wanting to end the relationship for her own well-being. She's not the one who broke off the wedding first; he did. His career being impacted is a consequence of his actions. She's not obligated to keep supporting him through his mistakes. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to end the relationship.\n"
