This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cheated and is now using his dance career as an excuse to avoid responsibility, while the author is overwhelmed with work and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author is justified in feeling hurt and betrayed. The cheating itself is a clear violation of trust, so the boyfriend is at fault there. The author's response to the cheating is a separate issue. She wants to hold him accountable, but he's using his financial situation and career as an excuse not to leave. \n\nThe author is doing most of the work at home, while the boyfriend is focused on his dance major and school activities. The boyfriend's excuses about the cheating, like not finding her attractive anymore, are not valid reasons for cheating. His behavior is inexcusable. \n\nThe author is considering kicking him out, which would impact his career. But given that he cheated, the author has the right to end the relationship on her terms. The boyfriend's claim that she would ruin his dreams if she kicks him out is his responsibility, not hers. She's not obligated to support his dreams if he's not supporting hers or contributing to the relationship. \n\nThe author has been the one carrying the household responsibilities, which is unfair. The boyfriend isn't pulling his weight and is making excuses. The author's desire to leave the relationship to take care of herself is understandable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's responding to cheating and neglect. She's not the one who cheated. Her actions are a consequence of his behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
