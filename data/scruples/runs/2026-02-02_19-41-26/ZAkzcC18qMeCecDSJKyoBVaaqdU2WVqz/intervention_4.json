This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cheated, was supposed to get married, then called it off, and now is being accused of ruining the author's life by staying in the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The BF cheated, gave poor excuses, and the author is overwhelmed with responsibilities. The BF is a dance major, which the author is considering as a reason not to kick him out because it would ruin his dreams. The author feels used and drained but is conflicted because breaking up would leave him homeless and affect his career.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider various angles. Cheating is a major betrayal. The BF's excuses don't sound sincere\u2014saying the girlfriend isn't attractive anymore when she's in recovery from an eating disorder is especially hurtful. The BF's behavior (not contributing to chores) adds to the author's stress. The BF's claim that leaving the relationship would ruin his dreams might be a manipulation tactic. The author is trying to balance her own well-being with his potential homelessness. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the BF's actions (cheating, lack of responsibility) are problematic. The author is justified in feeling wronged. However, the BF's situation is difficult. But the BF's actions have created this conflict. The author isn't obligated to stay in a harmful relationship. The BF's use of \"you'd ruin my dreams\" could be a way to guilt-trip her. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize her well-being. The BF's cheating and behavior are the root issues. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
