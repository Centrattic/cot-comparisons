This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend cheated, and the author is considering ending it but feels conflicted because it might ruin his career.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend called off the wedding a year before it was supposed to happen. Then they fought a lot but went to therapy. The current semester, he's taking a lot of dance classes and doing extra work, leading to him neglecting household responsibilities. He also cheated on her, and when confronted, gave excuses like not finding her attractive anymore. She's handling all the chores, paying rent, etc., and he can't move out due to financial reasons. She's considering kicking him out but feels guilty because he might have to move back home, which would affect his dance career.\n\nThe main question is whether she's in the wrong if she does this. The user wants an answer A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, cheating is generally considered a serious breach of trust in relationships. The boyfriend's excuses are pretty bad\u2014saying he likes someone else because she's skinny and implying the author isn't attractive anymore, especially when she's in recovery for anorexia. That's not just a mistake; it's emotionally abusive. When confronted, his responses are blaming and dismissive, even breaking his phone and blaming her for his anxiety. That's a red flag.\n\nShe's doing all the work around the house, paying most of the bills, and he's contributing only groceries. She's at her breaking point, feeling drained and used. If she kicks him out because he cheated and isn't pulling his weight, isn't that justified? He's the one who cheated and isn't taking responsibility. His argument that she'd ruin his dreams seems to be a way to guilt-trip her into staying, which is manipulative.\n\nBut maybe there's a consideration about his financial situation. However, he's the one who cheated, and she's not obligated to support him financially just because he's in a vulnerable position. His actions have led to the situation, so he's responsible for the consequences. She's not the one who broke the relationship; he did by cheating. Ending the relationship isn't ruining his dreams\u2014it's holding him accountable for his actions. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in wanting to leave after the betrayal and lack of accountability. The boyfriend's behavior is the root of the problem here.\n"
