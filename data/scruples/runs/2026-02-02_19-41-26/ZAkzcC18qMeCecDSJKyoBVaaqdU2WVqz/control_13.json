This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their boyfriend cheated and they want to kick him out, but he's a dance major and moving out would ruin his career. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend called off the wedding a year before they were supposed to get married. Then they went to therapy but things didn't improve. Now, he's taking a lot of dance classes and doing performances, which leaves him too busy to help with chores. The user is handling all the chores while working and studying. Then he cheated, and when confronted, he made excuses and even broke his phone when told to block the cheater. He's threatening that if kicked out, he'll have to go back home, which is 2 hours away, and that would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer.\n\nSo, the user is torn between their own well-being and his future. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for potentially ruining his dreams if they kick him out. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is a major betrayal. The boyfriend's excuses are pretty weak\u2014saying the other woman is skinny and that the user isn't attractive anymore, which is especially hurtful given her anorexia recovery. Also, blaming the user for making him break his phone seems like shifting responsibility. The user is clearly overwhelmed with work and responsibilities, while he's not contributing. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he can't move out and would have to return home, which is far away. But that's his responsibility, not hers. The user isn't obligated to support his dreams if he's not contributing to the relationship and has cheated. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many, and the user has the right to prioritize their own well-being. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions have already caused significant harm, and his dreams shouldn't take precedence over the user's right to be in a respectful, non-abusive relationship. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
