This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-term relationship where the boyfriend cheated. The user is considering ending the relationship but feels conflicted because doing so might ruin her boyfriend's career dreams. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The boyfriend ended the engagement a year ago, which is a big deal. Then they went to therapy but didn't resolve the issues. Now, the boyfriend is taking on a lot of dance classes and extracurriculars but isn't contributing to household chores. The user is handling all the chores, working, and studying, which sounds really overwhelming. Plus, there's the cheating, and when confronted, he gave excuses that don't seem valid\u2014like blaming the user's weight or saying the other woman is funny.\n\nThe key points here are the cheating, the imbalance in responsibilities, and the boyfriend's refusal to take accountability. Cheating is a major breach of trust, and his excuses, especially about the other woman being a friend, are weak. The user is supporting them financially, which adds to the stress. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's argument is that leaving would ruin his dreams. But if he's prioritizing his career over maintaining a healthy relationship, maybe he's the one who isn't taking responsibility. The user isn't just ending the relationship for no reason; there's been ongoing issues leading up to this point. The cheating is a significant factor here. \n\nI should also think about the user's well-being. She's feeling drained and used. It's important for her to take care of herself, especially given her history with anorexia. Staying in a relationship where she's being treated poorly might be harmful to her recovery. \n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend's actions (cheating, excuses, not contributing) are problematic. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave because of these reasons. The fact that he's using his career as an excuse doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to maintain a healthy relationship. The user has the right to prioritize her own well-being and happiness. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
