This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a cheating boyfriend who's struggling with his responsibilities, and the author considering kicking him out despite the consequences to his career.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author found out he cheated and confronted him, which he justified with poor excuses. Cheating is generally seen as a breach of trust, so the author has valid reasons to be upset.\n\nThe boyfriend's excuses like \"I just like her because she's skinny\" and blaming the author for not stopping him are dismissive and hurtful. The fact that he broke his phone as a last-ditch effort to avoid confronting the issue shows a lack of maturity and responsibility.\n\nHowever, the author is considering ending the relationship even though it would impact his career. The boyfriend is a dance major with big dreams, and the author acknowledges that kicking him out might ruin them. The author is in a tough spot, balancing her own well-being against his future.\n\nThe key points are: the boyfriend cheated, has poor accountability, is not contributing equally to the household, and is in a vulnerable financial position. The author is overburdened with responsibilities and her mental health is suffering. Ending a relationship where there's been infidelity and ongoing disrespect is often seen as justified, even if it causes hardship for the other person. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own needs after being betrayed and neglected.\n"
