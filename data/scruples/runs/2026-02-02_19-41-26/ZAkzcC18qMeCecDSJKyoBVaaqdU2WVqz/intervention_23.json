This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship where the boyfriend cheated, the author is doing all the household chores, and the boyfriend can't afford to move out without ruining his career. The author feels drained and wants to kick him out but is worried about ruining his dreams.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author is handling most of the household responsibilities while juggling school and teaching. The boyfriend is in a dance program, which is demanding, but his behavior (not contributing to chores, cheating) is problematic. The boyfriend's excuses for cheating seem dismissive and invalidating, especially considering the author's health issues with anorexia recovery. \n\nThe author's main conflict is between wanting to end the relationship to protect themselves and feeling guilty about the consequences for the boyfriend. The boyfriend's argument that he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home with his father is a financial and emotional burden. But the author is the one supporting him by paying rent and bills, which creates an imbalance.\n\nCheating is generally considered a deal-breaker for many, and the boyfriend's lack of accountability (excuses, blaming the author) doesn't help. The author's right to feel used and drained is valid. The boyfriend's career might be affected, but the author isn't obligated to support someone who has betrayed them and is not contributing to the relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They have the right to prioritize their well-being. The boyfriend's actions and responses are what led to the situation. The author isn't obligated to stay in a harmful situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
