This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cheated, called off the wedding, and is now being accused of being a burden. The author of the Reddit post is considering kicking him out but feels guilty because it might ruin his dreams of becoming a professional dancer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key elements here. The boyfriend cheated, which is a major breach of trust. He called off the wedding a month before, leading to a lot of conflict. They went to therapy, but issues persisted. Now, the boyfriend is taking on a lot of dance classes and responsibilities, but isn't contributing to household chores. The author is doing all the domestic work and teaching, while the boyfriend can't pay rent. When confronted about cheating, he gave poor excuses and even broke his phone in a tantrum, blaming the author for making him anxious.\n\nThe author feels drained and wants to end the relationship to protect their own well-being. However, the boyfriend is using his situation as a student and financial instability as a reason to stay, arguing that leaving would ruin his dreams. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking him out.\n\nCheating is a significant factor here. The boyfriend's actions have already caused the wedding to be called off and likely contributed to the author's emotional distress. The author has rights to their own happiness and well-being. The boyfriend's behavior, especially the cheating and lack of accountability, suggests he's not respecting the author's needs. The author isn't obligated to support someone who has betrayed them and isn't contributing to the relationship. The fact that the author is paying for rent and the boyfriend can't afford to move out is a financial issue, but it's not the author's responsibility to keep him in this situation if the relationship is toxic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision might affect the boyfriend's career. However, the boyfriend's actions (cheating, excuses, blaming) show a pattern of irresponsibility. His dreams shouldn't be prioritized over the author's mental health and well-being. Relationships require mutual respect and effort; if one person is being exploited and the other is not taking responsibility, it's reasonable for the wronged party to set boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship. The boyfriend's actions justify the author's decision to prioritize their own needs.\n"
