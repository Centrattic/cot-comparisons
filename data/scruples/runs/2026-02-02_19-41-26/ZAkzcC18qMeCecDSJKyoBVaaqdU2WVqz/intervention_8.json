This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend cheated, called off a wedding, and is now making demands that the author might not be able to meet. The author is considering ending the relationship, but the boyfriend argues that she would be ruining his dreams if she does.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend cheated, which is a major breach of trust. He also canceled the wedding, which suggests a serious breakdown in the relationship. The author is handling most of the household responsibilities while he's busy with school and dance commitments. Plus, he's given some questionable excuses for his cheating behavior, like blaming the girlfriend's body image and making light of his actions.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that if the author kicks him out, he'd have to move back home and his dreams of becoming a professional dancer would be ruined. However, the author is feeling drained and overworked, and he's not contributing his fair share to the household. The financial aspect is also a factor here, as he can't afford to live on his own right now.\n\nBut wait, if someone has cheated and is making excuses, especially ones that are hurtful and dismissive, isn't that a valid reason to end the relationship? The author is just trying to take back her life and well-being. The boyfriend's career might be in jeopardy, but his actions have already contributed to the situation by not being supportive and by cheating. His dependency on the author financially and domestically might also be a red flag about his responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that she's being selfish if she leaves him without a place to stay. But is she responsible for his financial stability now? He made the choices that led to this situation\u2014cheating and not contributing to the household. The author has the right to prioritize her own health and happiness, especially after such betrayal.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for following through with ending the relationship despite the consequences. Since the cheating and lack of accountability are on the boyfriend's side, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting herself and making a difficult decision. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
