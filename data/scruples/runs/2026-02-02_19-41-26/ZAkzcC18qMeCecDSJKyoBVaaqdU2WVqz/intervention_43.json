This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a college senior in a 3-year relationship with her boyfriend. They were engaged but called off the wedding. Then they fought but went to therapy. Now, the boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy schedule, and the user feels she's doing all the chores, cooking, cleaning, and even teaching 15 hours a week. He cheated, gave some bad excuses, and when confronted, he broke his phone and blamed her. Now she wants to kick him out, but he says she'd ruin his dreams of being a dancer since he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home. She's weighing whether she's wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, the cheating is a big deal. Cheating is generally considered a betrayal, and the excuses he gave are really poor. The boyfriend isn't taking responsibility; instead, he's making excuses about her appearance and even blaming her for his actions. That's pretty toxic.\n\nThe user is taking on a lot of responsibilities, both in terms of chores and financial support. He's not contributing equally, which is causing her stress. She's working hard and still managing her studies. The situation seems unbalanced.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that she's ruining his dreams by making him leave. But he's the one who cheated and isn't maintaining the relationship properly. He's also not taking responsibility for his behavior and is instead blaming her. His response to being confronted (breaking the phone, blaming her for his anxiety) is not healthy or fair.\n\nOn the other hand, he's a student, and moving away might affect his career. But he's also the one who chose to engage in a cheater relationship and not hold up his end of the responsibilities. The user is in a position where she's being exploited in terms of emotional and physical labor. She's also recovering from an eating disorder, which adds to her stress.\n\nThe user is considering leaving the relationship to protect her well-being. She's not the one who's violated the trust; it's the boyfriend. So, if she leaves him, is she in the wrong? Well, in most cases, the person who cheated is the one at fault. The user is standing up for herself after being wronged. Even though it might impact his future, it's his own actions that led to the situation. She's not obligated to support someone who's not supporting her and has betrayed her.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (she's not in the wrong). She's justified in wanting to end a relationship where she's being treated poorly and is supporting someone who isn't reciprocal. The boyfriend's claims about ruining his dreams are his own responsibility, given his behavior.\n"
