This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering ruining her boyfriend's dreams after he cheated. The author is a college senior, and they've been together for almost three years. There was a planned wedding that got called off a year ago. They tried therapy but things didn't improve. Now, her boyfriend is taking a heavy dance workload, not contributing much to household chores, and she's doing all the cooking, cleaning, etc., while also managing her own work and studies. Then he cheated, gave her a bunch of terrible excuses, and when she confronted him, he even broke his phone and blamed her for making him anxious. She feels exhausted and wants to kick him out, but he argues that she'd be ruining his dreams of being a dancer because he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home. The question is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. He's not contributing to the household, especially financially\u2014he only pays for groceries. She's handling all the other responsibilities. Cheating is generally considered a serious issue in relationships. The excuses he gave during the confrontation are pretty weak. The fact that he's blaming her for making him anxious and even broke his phone seems like an attempt to shift responsibility. \n\nOn the other hand, he's a dance major, and moving back home might impact his career goals. However, he's the one who caused the problem by cheating. His behavior (not contributing, cheating) led to her considering ending the relationship. She's also dealing with the aftermath of an eating disorder, which adds to her stress. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're trying to see if there's a different perspective. But from the information given, the boyfriend's actions are clearly in the wrong. Cheating is a major issue, and his excuses are inexcusable. The author is just trying to stand up for herself after being taken advantage of. Even if kicking him out affects his career, he's the one who broke the trust. So the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions justify her decision.\n"
