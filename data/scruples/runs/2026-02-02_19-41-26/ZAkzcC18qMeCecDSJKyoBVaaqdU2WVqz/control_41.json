This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend cheated and is causing a lot of stress by not contributing to household responsibilities. The boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy workload, leading to him being exhausted and not helping around the house. The author is doing all the chores, working, and studying, while the boyfriend's dad is described as a \"POS\" and he can't afford to move out. The key points here are the infidelity, the imbalance in responsibilities, and the boyfriend's claims about ruining his dreams if the author kicks him out.\n\nFirst, cheating is a significant betrayal. The boyfriend not only cheated but also gave excuses that are dismissive and hurtful, like saying the author isn't attractive anymore. That's pretty harsh, especially considering she's working on her recovery from an eating disorder. His excuses don't hold up, and the fact that he continued the relationship while still being friends with the person he cheated with is another red flag.\n\nThen there's the issue of responsibility. The author is doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, and dishes while managing her own studies and teaching. The boyfriend is in a demanding program but isn't contributing to his share of the household duties. Even if he's busy, that doesn't justify neglecting basic responsibilities. The author is clearly overwhelmed, and the boyfriend isn't supporting her, either emotionally or practically.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that the author would ruin his dreams by kicking him out is a bit of a non-sequitur. His dreams of becoming a professional dancer shouldn't be prioritized over the author's well-being and the fact that he cheated. The responsibility for his situation is partially his own making, especially since he's the one who called off the wedding and didn't take accountability for his actions. His inability to move out is a result of his own choices and financial decisions, not the author's.\n\nThe author is standing up for herself, which is important. She's in a relationship where she's being taken advantage of, both emotionally and in terms of household labor. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014cheating, making excuses, blaming her for his broken phone, and not contributing\u2014shows a lack of respect and consideration. The author isn't the one who caused the cheating; that's on him. Her desire to end the relationship because of his actions is justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to protect her own mental health and set boundaries after being wronged. The boyfriend's claims about ruining his dreams are an attempt to guilt-trip her, but the real issue is his lack of responsibility and betrayal. The author's actions in considering kicking him out are a reasonable response to his behavior, not the cause of his problems.\n"
