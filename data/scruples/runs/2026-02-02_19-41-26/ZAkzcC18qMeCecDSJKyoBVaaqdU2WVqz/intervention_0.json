This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup where the boyfriend cheated, leading to the author wanting to end the relationship but feeling conflicted because it would impact his future as a dancer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend called off the wedding, cheated, gave poor excuses, and the author is handling all household responsibilities. The boyfriend claims that ending the relationship would ruin his dreams because he can't afford to leave and would have to move back home. The author is struggling with whether she's at fault.\n\nCheating is a significant breach of trust, and it's generally considered a valid reason to end a relationship. The boyfriend's excuses, like blaming the author for not stopping him or making him anxious, seem to deflect responsibility. The author is overwhelmed with work and responsibilities, which adds to her stress.\n\nThe boyfriend's financial situation and career goals are his own issues. While he might face challenges moving back home, that's a consequence of his actions, not the author's fault. She's already supporting him in terms of household chores and finances. The author's decision to end the relationship is about her well-being and safety, not just about convenience.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions led to the situation, and she's justified in prioritizing her needs. Ending a relationship where there's been infidelity is a personal choice, and she's not obligated to sacrifice her well-being to keep it together for his sake. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
