This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who cheated, called off the wedding, and now the author is considering kicking him out but feels guilty because it might ruin his dreams.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend cheated, gave poor excuses, and the author is overwhelmed with responsibilities. The boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy schedule, and he's not contributing much financially or domestically. The author is handling most of the chores, school, and work. The boyfriend can't afford to move out and would have to go back home, which is two hours away. He claims that if she kicks him out, she's ruining his dreams of being a professional dancer.\n\nThe author is conflicted because she wants to leave but feels responsible for his future. The question is whether she's in the wrong for potentially ruining his dreams by ending the relationship or if he's in the wrong for cheating and not helping around the house.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is generally considered a betrayal, which is a significant reason for ending a relationship. The boyfriend's excuses for cheating, especially mentioning that he doesn't find the author attractive anymore, might indicate deeper issues. The author is clearly the one carrying the emotional and physical labor in the relationship, which is unfair. The boyfriend's argument that leaving would ruin his dreams might be a way to avoid accountability for his actions.\n\nHowever, the author is also considering the financial realities. The boyfriend can't afford to move out, so she's stuck in a situation where she supports him financially and emotionally, even though he's not contributing. She's feeling drained and used. In such cases, the person who cheated is usually considered to be the one at fault. The author might feel she's in a difficult position because she's caught between her own well-being and his potential future. But since his cheating was a major violation, and he's not contributing to the relationship, it's more about his actions leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship despite the consequences. She's justified in prioritizing her own well-being after being cheated on and feeling overburdened. The boyfriend's dreams are his responsibility to manage, especially after his actions have caused the relationship to be strained. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
