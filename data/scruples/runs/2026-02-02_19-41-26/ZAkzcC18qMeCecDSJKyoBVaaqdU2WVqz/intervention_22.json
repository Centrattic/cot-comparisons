This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a long-term relationship where the boyfriend cheated, and the author is considering kicking him out, which would ruin his career as a dancer. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author has been putting in a lot of effort, handling all the chores, while the boyfriend is overwhelmed with his dance classes and commitments. His excuses for cheating are pretty bad\u2014like saying he likes someone because she's skinny and the author isn't attractive anymore. Also, he blames her for making him anxious when she confronted him. That's pretty toxic behavior.\n\nNow, the author is considering kicking him out, but he argues that she's ruining his dreams. He's in a position where moving out would require going back home, which is 2 hours away. However, he's the one who called off the wedding a year prior, which already shows some instability in the relationship. The author is supporting him financially, which might be creating an imbalance where she feels she can't leave because of his situation.\n\nThe key points here are: the cheating, the toxic responses, the imbalance in responsibilities, and the author's financial support. The boyfriend's actions have already caused significant harm, and his excuses are dismissive. The author's desire to end the relationship is driven by her own well-being and the betrayal. She's being responsible by trying to manage their living situation, but he's not contributing and is instead blaming her.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the boyfriend's cheating and the way he handled the situation are clearly at fault. The author is standing up for herself and trying to protect her own mental health. While the situation is complicated by financial and housing issues, the root cause is his infidelity and lack of accountability. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering leaving, even if it affects his career. His choices led to this outcome, so the responsibility lies with him.\n"
