This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend cheated, called off the wedding, and is now being really demanding and not contributing to household chores. The author is considering kicking him out but is worried it would ruin his dreams.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The boyfriend cheated, which is a big deal. He also made excuses for his cheating, like not finding the author attractive anymore and wanting to stay friends with the other girl. That's pretty insidious. Then there's the issue of the author taking on all the domestic responsibilities while the boyfriend is busy with school and dance, which is understandable but adds to the stress. The author is supporting them financially, and the boyfriend can't leave because he'd have to go back home and his career is at stake. But the author is feeling drained and used.\n\nNow, the key points here are the cheating, the excuses given, the imbalance in household responsibilities, and the author's financial support. The boyfriend is using his career as a reason not to leave, but the author is the one who is actually providing the financial support. In a healthy relationship, both partners should contribute to their living expenses and household duties. The fact that he's not pulling his weight on either front is a problem. The cheating is a major betrayal, and his excuses make it clear he's not taking responsibility. The author has the right to feel hurt and to want to end the relationship, especially since he's not showing any intention to change or be accountable. The financial support from the author's family might be a factor, but the boyfriend's actions don't justify his behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect her own well-being and set boundaries. The boyfriend's dreams shouldn't come at the cost of the author's peace and self-respect. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
