This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who cheated, called off the wedding, and is now contributing minimally to household responsibilities. The woman is considering kicking him out, but he argues she would ruin his dreams of becoming a professional dancer because he can't afford to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the cheating. Cheating is generally considered a serious breach in a relationship. The boyfriend gave excuses like not finding her attractive anymore, which could be a red flag. The fact that he continued the relationship after cheating is another issue. He even had a friend he was seeing right under the woman's nose, which adds to the betrayal.\n\nThen there's the issue of household responsibilities. She's handling all the chores and more while he's focused on his dance major and other commitments. He's not pulling his weight financially either, only paying for groceries. If the relationship is already strained, this imbalance could be contributing to her feeling drained and used.\n\nThe key point is whether she's in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship or if she's justified in her actions. The boyfriend claims she'd ruin his dreams by making him leave. However, his actions (cheating, not contributing) have already likely damaged their relationship. She's the one who's been affected by his decisions. The fact that he's in a vulnerable position financially doesn't mean she's obligated to stay with him. His choices have consequences, and she has the right to prioritize her own well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, cheating is a major issue. If she stays, she's enabling his behavior and the current imbalance. If she leaves, she's making a choice that's right for herself. The argument that she's ruining his dreams is weak because he's already made poor choices that led to this situation. She's not responsible for his poor decisions. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. She's justified in feeling wronged and making a decision that's best for her, even if it affects him. Cheating is a significant betrayal, and she has the right to end the relationship on her terms.\n"
