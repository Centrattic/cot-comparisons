This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here based on the situation described. The author's boyfriend cheated, broke off the engagement, and is now making excuses. The author is considering ending the relationship but feels conflicted because it might ruin his career as a dancer since he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend cheated, gave poor excuses, and the author is overwhelmed with responsibilities. The author is considering ending the relationship but is concerned about the consequences for her boyfriend. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for wanting to end the relationship? Well, cheating is a major breach of trust. The boyfriend's excuses, like \"I just like her because she's skinny\" and blaming the author for not stopping him, are clearly problematic. The author is taking on most of the household responsibilities, which is unfair. The boyfriend's inability to manage his responsibilities and his actions (like breaking his phone) add to the stress.\n\nThe author is considering kicking him out because she's exhausted and feels used. Even though it might affect his career, he's the one who made choices that led to this situation\u2014cheating and not contributing to the household. The boyfriend's claims about being homeless are his own responsibility due to financial decisions and not contributing to their shared living expenses.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend cheated, the author isn't obligated to stay in the relationship. Ending it because of betrayal and unfair distribution of labor isn't wrong. The boyfriend's potential hardship is a consequence of his actions. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being and ending the relationship, even if it affects his career. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
