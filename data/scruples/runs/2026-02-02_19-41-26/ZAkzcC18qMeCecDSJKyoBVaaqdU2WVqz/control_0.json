This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend cheated on her, called off the wedding, and is now being really inconsiderate with chores while she's handling everything else. She's considering kicking him out but he's saying she'd ruin his dreams.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. They've been together almost 3 years, got engaged, then he called it off. They went to therapy but things didn't improve. Now he's a dance major with a heavy schedule, but she's doing all the household work. Then he cheated, gave bad excuses, and when confronted, he blamed her. She feels drained and used. He can't afford to move out and would have to go back home, which is 2 hours away.\n\nSo, the author is asking if she'd be wrong to kick him out, which would ruin his plans. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the situation, the boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. He's given excuses that seem dismissive and even a bit cruel, especially about not finding her attractive. His behavior after being confronted, like breaking his phone and blaming her, shows a lack of responsibility. She's handling all the chores, financial responsibilities except groceries, and her own academic and work commitments. She's also dealing with an eating disorder recovery, which adds to her stress.\n\nHe argues that she'd ruin his dreams, but his actions led to this situation. Cheating is a significant issue that can justify ending the relationship. The fact that he's not contributing to the household and is emotionally abusive (e.g., comments about her weight) further supports her stance. His financial inability to move out doesn't excuse his behavior; it's his responsibility to find solutions, not hers to enable his unfaithful and inconsiderate actions.\n\nThe user might think that he's a victim here because he can't move out, but the cheating and lack of accountability are on him. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being after his betrayal. It's important to consider that staying in an abusive or draining relationship isn't healthy. The boyfriend's \"dreams\" shouldn't take precedence over his infidelity and the harm he's caused.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's justified in wanting to end the relationship given his cheating and the emotional/physical toll he's taken on her.\n"
