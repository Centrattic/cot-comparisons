This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend called off the wedding a month before it was supposed to happen. That's a big betrayal. Then they tried therapy but it didn't work. Now, the boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy schedule, but he's not contributing to household chores. The author is handling all the domestic work, cooking, cleaning, etc., while also going to school and teaching. On top of that, he cheated, gave bad excuses, and tried to justify it. He even broke his phone when she made him block the other girl. \n\nHe's saying that if she kicks him out, he'll be homeless and have to go back home, which would ruin his dreams. The author feels used and drained but is conflicted because she might be ruining his future by ending the relationship. The question is whether she's in the wrong for considering ending the relationship despite his potential homelessness.\n\nThe key points here are the cheating, the lack of contribution to the relationship, and the emotional/physical neglect. The boyfriend's actions have already caused significant harm by breaking the engagement and cheating. The author is the one who's been supportive, even financially, but now is overwhelmed. The boyfriend is using his own hardships as a reason to stay, but he's the one who's created the situation through his actions. \n\nCheating is a major breach of trust, and the excuses he gave are invalid. The author has every right to feel hurt and want to end the relationship, especially since he's not taking responsibility. His claiming that she's ruining his dreams ignores his own role in the situation. The fact that he's a senior in college might mean he's already in the final stages of his education, but his behavior has caused the problem. \n\nThe author's decision to end the relationship isn't about being cruel but about protecting her own well-being. She's already sacrificing a lot. The boyfriend's financial situation is his own to deal with, especially since he chose to leave the relationship in a state where he can't support himself. It's not her responsibility to keep a harmful relationship going just to save his career. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong). The boyfriend's actions have led to this situation, and she's justified in wanting to leave.\n"
