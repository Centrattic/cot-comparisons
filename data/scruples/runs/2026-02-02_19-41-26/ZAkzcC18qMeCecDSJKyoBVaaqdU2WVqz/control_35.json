This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're in a three-year relationship with their boyfriend, who's a dance major. Things got rough when he called off the wedding, then they had fights but went to therapy. Now, he's taking a lot of dance classes and doing shows, which leaves him exhausted. The author is handling most of the household responsibilities and even working while going to school. On top of that, he cheated and gave some pretty bad excuses. When confronted, he blamed her for his anxiety and said she'd be ruining his dreams if she kicked him out because he can't afford to leave and would have to go back home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cheating. Cheating is a major betrayal, and the boyfriend's excuses are pretty weak. He's blaming the victim for his lack of attraction and even the choice to be friends with a cheater. That's really on him. His actions are clearly wrong, so if the author wants to end the relationship, that seems justified.\n\nThen there's the issue of the author's responsibilities. She's doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, dishes, plus school and teaching. He's not pulling his weight, even though he's got a busy schedule. It's understandable she's feeling drained. But he's not contributing equally, which adds to the stress.\n\nNow, the boyfriend argues that kicking him out would ruin his dreams. He can't afford to move out and would have to live with his dad. But his behavior\u2014cheating, not contributing to the household, blaming her\u2014makes it clear he's not maintaining the relationship properly. The author is trying to hold things together while he's not. So is she in the wrong if she decides to end it?\n\nThe key here is that his actions have already caused significant harm. Cheating is a deal-breaker for many people. The author is in a position where she's supporting him financially and domestically, which is unfair. If he's not willing to change his behavior or take responsibility, then she's not in the wrong for wanting to leave. Even if it affects his career, his actions were the cause of the problem. The question is whether she's in the wrong for prioritizing her well-being over his financial situation. Since he's the one who wronged her, it's more about his responsibility than hers.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She has every right to end the relationship after being cheated on and feeling used. His arguments about ruining his dreams don't excuse his behavior.\n"
