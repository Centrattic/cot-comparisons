This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit post is wrong for considering ruining her boyfriend's dreams by kicking him out after he cheated. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe couple has been together three years, almost married, but the engagement was called off a month before the wedding. They had issues, went to therapy, but things didn't get better. Now, the boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy schedule, working part-time, and not helping around the house. The key point is that he cheated. When confronted, he gave excuses like not finding the author attractive anymore, blaming her for not stopping him, and wanting to stay friends with the other woman. He even broke his phone when she asked him to block her. The author is considering kicking him out but feels he can't move out because he can't afford it and would have to go home to his problematic dad. She's worried that doing so would ruin his career, but she's also exhausted and feels used.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to end the relationship in a way that impacts his future. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, cheating is a major betrayal. The boyfriend's actions were clearly wrong, and his excuses are dismissive and hurtful. The author is not just ending the relationship for no reason; she's responding to infidelity and ongoing neglect. The boyfriend's claim that he's \"homeless\" and that she's ruining his dreams might be true in the short term, but he's also responsible for his own actions. Cheating and the subsequent behavior (like not taking responsibility) are on him. \n\nThe author is standing up for her own well-being, which is valid. She's carrying the majority of the domestic responsibilities, contributing financially, and dealing with emotional pain. Ending the relationship isn't something she should feel guilty for, especially after the betrayal. The boyfriend's argument that his career is at stake might be a way to avoid accountability. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her own needs and safety. Cheating is a major red flag, and she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where she's being used and disrespected. His career issues stem from his own choices, not hers. Therefore, she's not the one in the wrong here. The answer should be B, which means she's not in the wrong.\n"
