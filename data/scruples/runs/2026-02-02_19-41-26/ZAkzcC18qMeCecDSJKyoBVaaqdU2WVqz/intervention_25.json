This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that her boyfriend cheated, and she's considering kicking him out, but he says that would ruin his dreams because he can't afford to move out and would have to go back home. She's conflicted because she feels used but doesn't want to ruin his life.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend cheated, which is a major betrayal. The author has been doing all the chores and work, while he's busy with school and dance. He also gave poor excuses for cheating, like not finding her attractive anymore. He even broke his phone when she made him block the person he cheated with. Now, she's thinking of kicking him out but is worried about ruining his life since he can't afford to move out. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a typical perspective, cheating is a serious issue and often leads to the end of a relationship. The boyfriend's actions have caused emotional harm, and his excuses are dismissive. The author is trying to stand up for herself and her needs, which is understandable. However, she's feeling guilty because it might affect his future. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If someone is being cheated on, they have the right to prioritize their own well-being. The boyfriend's claim that she's ruining his dreams might be more about his own convenience rather than her being in the wrong. He's also not taking responsibility for his actions, blaming her for his anxiety. So, it's more about him not handling the situation appropriately. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one who cheated. She's the one trying to set boundaries after being wronged. So, she's not in the wrong. Her actions to protect herself are justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
