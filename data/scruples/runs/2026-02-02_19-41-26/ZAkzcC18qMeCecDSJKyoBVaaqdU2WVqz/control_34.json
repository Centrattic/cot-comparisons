This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend cheated, and now the author is considering kicking him out, which would negatively impact his career as a dancer. The question is whether the author is wrong for considering this.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend called off the wedding, cheated, gave poor excuses, and now the author feels overwhelmed with responsibilities. The boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy schedule, and he's not contributing much at home. The author is handling most of the chores and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend claims that if she kicks him out, he'll be ruined, but he's the one who cheated.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, cheating is a serious betrayal. The boyfriend's actions have already caused significant harm to the relationship. The author is clearly the one who's been wronged here. The boyfriend's excuses about not finding her attractive anymore are hurtful, especially considering she's in recovery from an eating disorder. His behavior after being confronted, like breaking his phone and blaming her, shows a lack of accountability.\n\nNow, considering the author's responsibility. The user is asking if she's in the wrong for considering ending the relationship in a way that might affect his future. But the boyfriend's actions have already jeopardized their future together. The wedding was called off, and he cheated, which is a major red flag. The author is at the point where she's exhausted and needs to prioritize her own well-being. Ending the relationship is a reasonable response to betrayal. It's not her responsibility to fix his life or his career, especially after his infidelity.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that she's ruining his dreams is ironic because he's the one who has already ruined their relationship. His career depends on his school, which he's attending with her support, but his cheating and lack of contribution at home are his own issues. The author is justified in wanting to leave a situation where she's overburdened and emotionally hurt.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She has every right to end the relationship after being cheated on and feeling neglected. His career is his own responsibility, and she shouldn't be held back by his mistakes.\n"
