This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their boyfriend cheating, breaking off the engagement, and then the author feeling overburdened with responsibilities while the boyfriend can't move out without ruining his career.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend called off the wedding, which is a major betrayal. Then he cheated, which is another serious issue. The author is handling all household chores, working, studying, and teaching, while the boyfriend is overwhelmed with dance classes and volunteer work. Now, when the author confronts him about moving out, he claims it would ruin his dreams because he can't afford to move elsewhere and would have to go back with his dad.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering or planning to kick him out. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the boyfriend's actions are clearly problematic. Cheating is a major violation of trust, and breaking off the wedding shows a lack of commitment. The excuses he gives for cheating are not justifiable. The author is handling all the responsibilities and is at their breaking point. The boyfriend's argument that leaving would ruin his life seems to be placing blame on the author for his own choices, like not saving money or maintaining the relationship. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable by expecting their partner to contribute equally. The boyfriend's inability to manage his responsibilities and his cheating make him the one at fault. The author is justified in wanting to end a relationship that's causing them emotional and physical exhaustion. The fact that he can't move out without going home doesn't absolve him of his actions. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and holding him accountable. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
