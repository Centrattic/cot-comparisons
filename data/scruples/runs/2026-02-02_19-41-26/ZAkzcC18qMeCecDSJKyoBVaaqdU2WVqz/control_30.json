This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship after her boyfriend cheated and is now being uncooperative. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together for three years. They were set to get married but called it off a month before. Then they tried therapy but it didn't help. Now, the boyfriend is a dance major with a heavy workload, taking multiple classes and dances, leading to him not contributing to household chores. The author is handling all the chores, working full-time, and teaching. Then there's the cheating incident, with the boyfriend giving excuses. When confronted, he breaks his phone and blames her for making him anxious. The author is considering kicking him out but feels conflicted because he might become homeless, affecting his career.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLooking at the boyfriend's actions: cheating is a major betrayal. His excuses are dismissive and hurtful. He's not contributing to the household, which adds to the author's stress. The author is in a tough position, having to manage everything while he's overwhelmed but still not pulling his weight. The cheating is a significant factor here. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that she's ruining his dreams by making him move out is weak given his behavior. His career issues are partly his own making, especially with the cheating and lack of responsibility. The author is prioritizing her own well-being after the betrayal. Ending a relationship after cheating is understandable, even if it causes some hardship for the other person. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing herself and setting boundaries. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No). The author is not in the wrong.\n"
