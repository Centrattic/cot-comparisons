This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated. Cheating is a serious issue in relationships. The author found out, and the boyfriend gave excuses that seem dismissive and harmful. He mentioned not finding the author attractive anymore, which is especially hurtful given her recovery from anorexia. Also, he kept the friend who cheated and even broke his phone when asked to block her. That sounds like he's not taking the situation seriously and is blaming the author for his actions.\n\nThe author is handling a lot: full-time student, teaching 15 hours a week, cooking, cleaning, etc., while the boyfriend is focusing on his dance major but not contributing equally. He's not paying rent or bills, just groceries. She's supporting him financially, which adds to the imbalance.\n\nHe argues that if she kicks him out, he'll be homeless and his dreams of being a professional dancer will be ruined. But he's the one who made choices (cheating, not contributing) that led to this situation. The author is being asked to sacrifice her well-being for his mistakes. \n\nSo, the key points here are the cheating, the lack of accountability, the imbalance in responsibilities, and the emotional harm caused. The author is standing up for herself, which is understandable. She's not the one who violated trust or neglected duties. The boyfriend's arguments about ruining his dreams seem weak compared to the harm he's caused. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's reacting to his cheating and failure to meet his responsibilities, which are significant issues.\n"
