This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for potentially ruining her boyfriend's dreams after he cheated. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend cheated. Cheating is a major betrayal in a relationship. The author mentions he gave her excuses, like not finding her attractive anymore and wanting to stay friends with the other woman. Those are pretty weak and self-centered justifications. Cheating is generally considered a serious issue, and the person who cheated is at fault here.\n\nNow, the author is considering ending the relationship. She's doing a lot of the work around the house, working, and teaching, while he's struggling with his own responsibilities. The boyfriend is using his lack of financial resources as an argument against being kicked out, claiming she'd ruin his dreams by making him move back in with his dad. But his cheating has already caused significant harm. \n\nThe key point here is that the author is not the one who cheated. She's trying to end a relationship where she's been wronged. She's also managing her own recovery from an eating disorder, which adds another layer of stress. The boyfriend's actions have already disrupted their future plans, like the wedding. \n\nIf the author ends the relationship, it's a consequence of his actions, not her fault. He's making claims that she's ruining his life, but he was the one who broke the trust. People have to face the consequences of their choices. The author is standing up for herself and her well-being, which is valid. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong. She's responding to his betrayal and the imbalance in their relationship. His arguments don't excuse his behavior. Therefore, Answer B (No) is correct.\n"
