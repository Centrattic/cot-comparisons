This is my first post, but I watch a lot of Reddit videos so I thought I might be able to get help here.\nFor background, my boyfriend and I have been together almost 3 years now. Things were going really well for a while, we were even supposed to get married last year. That\u2019s when things went downhill. A month before the wedding he called it off. Since then, we fought a lot, but went to therapy and tried to work things out. Obviously, that didn\u2019t really solve everything.\nThat brings us to this semester (we\u2019re both college seniors) when shit absolutely hit the fan. Now, most semesters he takes 6 dance classes and does 2 dances for our schools company (if you hadn\u2019t gathered, he\u2019s a dance major). This semester he took 6 classes but also did 4 dances. He also has been taking a lot of outside volunteer work for the company. Not only does this mean he basically can\u2019t work at all anymore, it also means when he gets home he just wants to relax because he\u2019s exhausted. That wouldn\u2019t be too bad if he threw away his trash, put his dishes in the sink, and put his laundry in the basket. But he doesn\u2019t. So now I cook, clean, do laundry and dishes plus go to school full time and teach 15 hours a week.\nTo top it all off, I found out he cheated on me. When I confronted him about he he gave me a myriad of excuses like: I just like her because she\u2019s skinny and I don\u2019t really find you attractive any more (I\u2019ve been working on losing weight but I\u2019m recovering from anorexia so I have to go slow), if you didn\u2019t want me to you should have just stopped me (???), and my favorite, I won\u2019t sleep with her anymore but I just want to stay her friend because she\u2019s funny (as a last ditch effort). When I made him block her because she showed up at our school while I was having lunch with him (she /still/ doesn\u2019t know I\u2019m his girlfriend), he broke his phone, then proceeded to blame me because I \u201cmade him anxious and embarrassed him\u201d.\nI\u2019m tired. My family pays the bills and rent; he only pays for groceries. At this point, I want to kick him out.  But, any time I tell him that he has to hold his end or leave, he says he would be homeless and I would be ruining his dreams. And he\u2019s right. He doesn\u2019t have the money to move out and would have to move 2 hours away back home with his POS dad. I would ruin his dreams of being a professional dancer. But I also just feel drained and used, and just want to feel good about myself again.\nSo, TL;DR my BF called off our wedding and cheated on me, but if I kicked him out I\u2019d ruin his whole life. \nSo, WIBTA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is asking whether \"the person who wrote this is in the wrong\" based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, let's break down the scenario. The author is in a 3-year relationship with her boyfriend, who called off their wedding. They've been in therapy, but things didn't get better. Now, the boyfriend is a dance major taking a heavy course load and doing a lot of extracurricular work with the dance company. The author is handling most of the household chores, working full-time, and teaching part-time. He cheated on her, and when confronted, gave various excuses. She wants to end the relationship, but he claims she'd ruin his future as a dancer by forcing him out, as he can't afford to move out and would have to go back to his dad's house. She's conflicted because she doesn't want to ruin his life but feels used and exhausted.\n\nSo, the key points here: cheating, excuses for cheating, unequal distribution of household responsibilities, and the boyfriend's inability to leave financially. The author is considering ending the relationship but is concerned about the impact on him.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's consider the context. Cheating is a serious breach of trust in a relationship. The boyfriend's behavior includes not only cheating but also making excuses that minimize his actions. The author is doing most of the work at home while he's overextended with his studies and dance, and she's also working and teaching. This seems like an imbalance. She's the one feeling drained and used. Her desire to leave the relationship might be justified given his actions and lack of accountability. However, the boyfriend's argument is that her actions would ruin his career. But his cheating and lack of responsibility could be the root cause here. \n\nThe boyfriend's excuses like not finding her attractive anymore are problematic, especially considering she's in recovery from an eating disorder. That adds another layer of emotional harm. The fact that he continued the relationship while cheating and then blamed her for wanting to block the other person shows a lack of respect and accountability.\n\nFinancial dependency is a factor, but it's not the author's fault. The boyfriend's inability to support himself might be due to his own lack of financial planning or poor decisions, including the cheating. The author isn't obligated to support someone who is abusive or unfaithful. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the boyfriend's actions (cheating, excuses, not contributing to chores) are the primary issues. The author has the right to protect her well-being and end a relationship where she's being treated poorly. Even though ending the relationship might impact his future, his actions were the catalyst for the situation. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. She's justified in walking away from a cheating partner who isn't taking responsibility and is exploiting her for financial and household support. The answer should be B (No).\n"
