When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a housemate, Sam, who hasn't paid his broadband share for three months, and the author blocked his devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: They all agreed to split the broadband cost. The author set up the internet and expected monthly payments. The other housemates set up standing orders, but Sam didn't. Initially, the author didn't mind because Sam would pay when asked, but now he's been ignoring messages for three months, so the author is paying half. \n\nThe author confronted Sam and gave a deadline. Sam didn't pay, so the author blocked his devices. Sam then complained about not being able to do coursework and damaged his wall. Now Sam is asking for more time to pay, and the author refuses and suggests using the library.\n\nI need to consider the agreements they had. They agreed to split the costs, so Sam's non-payment is a breach of that agreement. The author is covering half, which is unfair. Blocking internet access is a form of financial pressure. But is that justified? The author has a right to be paid, so enforcing payment by cutting off access could be seen as a reasonable step, especially if they agreed on the terms.\n\nHowever, the author is using a drastic method\u2014blocking internet\u2014without maybe giving Sam a chance to pay through other means. Also, Sam claims he needs the internet for coursework, which the author dismissed. If Sam really needs it for academic work, the author's action might hinder that, making it unfair. But Sam also smokes weed daily, which suggests he might be able to manage his finances better.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking matters into their own hands by blocking the devices. Legally, they might not have the right to do that. It's up to all parties to agree on how to split costs. If the author is paying more, maybe they should involve the others or seek a formal agreement. But in a shared living situation, informal agreements are common.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as taking control but also as overstepping. The author could have involved the other housemates to mediate. Also, the blocking caused Sam to damage his wall, which complicates things. The author might feel taken advantage of, but the response was a bit harsh given the academic claim.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the agreement was clear and the author is enforcing it to get payment, maybe not. But using internet access as a weapon could be seen as unfair, especially affecting Sam's studies. However, Sam's refusal to pay despite multiple reminders is also at fault. The author's action is a response to non-payment, so maybe it's a mutual issue. But since Sam hasn't paid and the author is trying to enforce the agreement, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
