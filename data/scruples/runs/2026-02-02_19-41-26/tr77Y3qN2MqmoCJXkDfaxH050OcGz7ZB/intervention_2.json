When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who blocked their housemate's internet access is in the wrong. The situation involves Sam not paying his share of the broadband for three months, and the author blocking his devices as a result. The key points here are about fairness, agreements between roommates, and the consequences of the actions taken.\n\nFirst, the author and housemates agreed that everyone would pay their share. The author mentions that Sam didn't set up a standing order, but in the past, he would pay when reminded. Recently, he's been ignoring messages or saying he'll pay later. The author then blocks Sam's devices after he still hasn't paid, leading to Sam's anger and damage to the wall. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for blocking the internet. Legally, I don't know, but ethically, it's more about the agreement and fairness. The author set up the agreement, and Sam is not fulfilling his part. However, blocking internet access might affect Sam's studies or work, especially if he needs it for coursework. The author mentioned that Sam's work might suffer, but they also argue that they're covering half the cost. \n\nBut the author also points out that Sam smokes weed daily, which might suggest he's not in a money crisis despite his claims. The author's action might be seen as taking control of a shared resource due to a breach of agreement, but cutting off access could be harsh. The key here is whether the author has the right to enforce payment by blocking internet. If the broadband is a shared expense, then not paying is a breach, but the method of enforcement might be problematic. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to enforce the agreement they all made. On the other hand, cutting off internet could hinder Sam's ability to work or study, which might not be fair. The author might have other options, like discussing with the group to find a compromise or involving the landlord if necessary. However, the author's main concern is being taken advantage of and ensuring they aren't paying for others' shares. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the agreement was clear and if there's a mutual understanding. If the agreement was that everyone pays on time, and the author's action is a last resort after repeated non-payment, then it's a bit of a gray area. But since Sam's coursework might be affected, the author might need to consider that. However, the author is also covering the cost, which is a financial burden. \n\nIn the end, it's a conflict between enforcing a shared agreement and the consequences of that enforcement. The answer could go either way, but considering the author's actions were based on the agreement and the other person's repeated non-payment, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the method of blocking internet might be seen as harsh, especially if it affects Sam's work. However, the user initially thought the author is wrong, but maybe after considering all aspects, it's a nuanced situation.\n"
