When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who blocked their housemate's internet is in the wrong. The situation involves shared costs and non-payment. \n\nFirst, look at the agreement: they all agreed to pay their share each month. Sam didn't set up a standing order but usually paid when asked. Now, he's three months behind, and the author is covering half the cost. The author confronted Sam and blocked his devices when he didn't pay. Sam is now upset and says the author is a bad friend.\n\nThe key points are the initial agreement, the breach of that agreement by Sam, and the author's response. Blocking internet access could be seen as a form of punishment, but it's a shared resource. However, the author is trying to enforce payment for a service that Sam benefits from. The question is whether the author overstepped by taking unilateral action.\n\nSam's argument is that he needs the internet for coursework. But the author points out that Sam's non-payment isn't affecting him financially yet. However, the author is still seeking to recover owed money. The author's actions might be justified as self-enforcement of an agreement, but it's a delicate situation because it affects others' access.\n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to cut off someone's internet for not paying their share? The author's method of enforcement could be seen as harsh, especially if Sam has a legitimate claim about needing internet for work. However, the agreement was clear, and the author is within their rights to seek payment. The main issue is the enforcement method. Maybe the author should have pursued a different approach, like involving the group or a mediator, but blocking the internet is a direct action to enforce payment. \n\nAlso, Sam's behavior of not paying and then reacting negatively (punching a wall) is problematic. The author's actions might be justified given Sam's non-cooperation. However, cutting off internet access could interfere with Sam's academic responsibilities, which complicates things. \n\nIn summary, the author is trying to enforce a shared agreement, which is reasonable. The blocking of devices is a direct consequence of non-payment. However, considering Sam's need for internet for coursework, the author might not have considered alternative solutions. The answer could lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance. But since the question is AITA, and the author is taking action to recover owed money, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
