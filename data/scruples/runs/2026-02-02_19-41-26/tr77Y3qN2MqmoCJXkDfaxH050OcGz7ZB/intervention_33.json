When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet because he hasn't paid his share for months.\n\nFirst, the setup: They have a house with four people. They agreed that each pays a quarter of the broadband at the start of the month. Sam didn't set up a standing order and hasn't paid for three months. The author ends up paying half the bill. When confronted, Sam agreed to pay but didn't, so the author blocked his devices. Sam then damaged his wall and is now claiming he needs the internet for coursework. The author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's main point is about being taken advantage of. They set up a payment plan, and Sam didn't follow through. The author tried to collect, even giving him chances. Blocking the internet is a way to enforce payment, but it affects Sam's coursework. However, the author argues that they're not being impacted financially at the moment, which is a bit confusing because earlier they said they were paying his share. Maybe the financial impact isn't as bad now because the author has been covering the costs, but Sam's non-payment is still a debt.\n\nThe key points here are about agreements and consequences. Did they have a prior agreement? Yes. The author is trying to enforce it. But using the internet as leverage might be problematic, especially if it affects Sam's studies. However, Sam also admitted to using the internet for gaming, which the others didn't know about, which could be a point about honesty.\n\nAlso, Sam's reaction\u2014punching a wall, calling the author a bad friend\u2014might be his fault for not dealing better with the situation. The author tried to reason, gave warnings, and followed through when payment wasn't made. Blocking internet access could be seen as a necessary step to enforce a shared agreement. However, the author might have considered alternative solutions, like involving a mediator or using a different method to collect the debt.\n\nBut in a shared living situation, especially among friends, taking unilateral actions like blocking internet can strain relationships. The author might have a point in expecting payment, but the method might be harsh. However, without a formal agreement in place (like a legally binding contract), the author's options are limited. They can't really force payment through legal means, so using the internet as a leverage is a practical, if not ideal, solution.\n\nOn the other hand, Sam's coursework issue is a new problem. The author's action might interfere with his academic responsibilities, which could be seen as unfair. But the author argues that Sam should use the campus libraries instead. That's a valid suggestion, and if the coursework is time-sensitive, blocking internet could be a problem. However, Sam's past behavior (smoking weed daily) might indicate a lack of responsibility, which could affect how the author views his current claims about needing the internet.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author tried to maintain the agreement and enforce it when payment wasn't received. While the method might be a bit heavy-handed, it's a common issue in shared living. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since they had an agreement and tried to collect, blocking the internet as a consequence isn't entirely their fault. But it's a judgment call. The fact that the author is still considering Sam a friend and not wanting to ruin the friendship shows they tried to balance fairness and friendship. However, the action taken might still be seen as wrong because it affects academic work, but the root of the problem is Sam's non-payment. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the agreement they had, even if the consequence affects Sam's studies. But maybe they should have found another way to handle it. However, given the circumstances, AITA situations often consider the action of taking charge, but also the potential negative consequences. Given that Sam's coursework is now an issue, maybe the author is in the right for enforcing payment but wrong for not considering the academic consequences. Hmm. It's a tough one. But overall, the author had a prior agreement and tried to enforce it. So maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
