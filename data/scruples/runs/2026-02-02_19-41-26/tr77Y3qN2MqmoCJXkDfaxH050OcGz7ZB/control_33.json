When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person (the author) is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The setup is four people sharing a broadband connection. They agreed that each would pay their share at the beginning of the month. The author is handling the payments, and Sam hasn't paid for three months. The author ends up paying for half the bill themselves. They confronted Sam, gave him a chance to pay, and when he didn't, they blocked his devices. Sam then acted out, damaging the wall and now claims he needs the internet for coursework.\n\nThe key points here are the agreement between roommates, the enforcement of that agreement, and the consequences of blocking internet access. The author's actions are based on Sam not fulfilling his financial responsibility. But the question is whether blocking internet access is justified, especially since Sam now needs it for coursework.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to enforce a mutual agreement and isn't being unfair by expecting payment. On the other hand, cutting off internet access might be seen as a harsh measure, especially if it affects Sam's studies. However, the author mentioned that the initial setup of faster broadband was agreed upon by all, and Sam's non-payment is leading to the others covering the cost. Also, the author allowed some leeway initially, but Sam's continued neglect led to the blocking.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship aspect. The author values the friendship but feels taken advantage of. They're trying to balance being a good friend and standing up for their own interests. The blocking is a form of leverage to get Sam to pay, which could be seen as a reasonable approach in the absence of a formal agreement. However, if the internet blocking is causing unnecessary harm, like affecting academic work, that might tip the scales.\n\nBut then again, the author has the right to expect their agreement to be respected. The problem is that the method of enforcement (blocking internet) is causing Sam to lose access to something he now claims is necessary. The author might argue that Sam should have anticipated this if he knew he might miss payments. Also, the author is offering alternatives like libraries, which Sam refuses, complicating the situation.\n\nLegally, if there's a verbal agreement, the author might have a case. However, in terms of friendship and shared living, it's more about social norms. The author's actions could be seen as fair if the original agreement wasn't honored. But if the blocking is causing more issues than it solves, maybe the approach is too harsh. The fact that Sam damaged property in response might also reflect poorly on him, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the payment agreement, as they followed through after multiple warnings. The blocking is a direct consequence of Sam's non-compliance. However, the impact on Sam's studies might make the author's action seem strict, but given the prior behavior of ignoring payments and the initial agreement, it's a justified self-defense of their own financial responsibility. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
