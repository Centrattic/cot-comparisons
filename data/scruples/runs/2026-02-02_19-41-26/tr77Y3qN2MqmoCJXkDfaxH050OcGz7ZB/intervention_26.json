When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a housemate, Sam, not paying his share for the broadband, and the author blocking his devices. \n\nFirst, the setup: the group agreed that everyone would pay their share each month. The author set up a system where people send their portion. Others used standing orders, but Sam didn't. He usually paid on time initially but then started ignoring messages for the past three months. The author ended up covering his share, leading to the author paying half of the broadband cost.\n\nThe author confronted Sam and said he'd block devices until payment. Sam didn't pay, so the author blocked him. Sam then got angry, punched a wall, and now wants to pay later. The author is now questioning if they were wrong for blocking Sam's internet access, especially since Sam claims he needs it for coursework.\n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the agreement was everyone pays their share. Sam wasn't paying, which is a breach of the agreed terms. The author tried to remind him multiple times without success. Blocking the internet seems like a way to enforce the agreement. However, blocking it when Sam needs it for coursework could be seen as punitive and maybe unfair, especially if it's affecting his studies. \n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the agreement they had. They were covering the costs, which is their share. Sam's actions of ignoring payments and then being upset when consequences follow might mean the author is in the right. However, the timing when Sam needs internet for work complicates it. The author could be seen as strict but upholding the agreement, or maybe too harsh by cutting off access when it's a necessity for Sam. \n\nBut the author's main point is that they don't want to be taken advantage of. They had a system, and when that's broken, taking action is their right. However, the consequence of blocking internet might be too harsh, especially if it's critical for Sam's coursework. So maybe the author is in the right for enforcing the payment but perhaps too harsh in the method. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the author had a prior agreement that non-payment would result in cutting off internet, then maybe it's justified. But since they didn't, maybe it's taking it too far. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions are based on a breach of agreement, but using blocking internet as a consequence could be seen as in the wrong if it's causing undue hardship for Sam. But the author's position is about being fair and not being taken advantage of. Hmm. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they were upholding the agreement, even if the method was a bit harsh. Sam's non-payment is the main issue here, and the author's action is a response to that.\n"
