When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because he hasn't paid his share. \n\nFirst, looking at the situation: They all agreed that each person would pay their share at the beginning of the month. Sam hasn't paid for three months, and the author is covering half the cost. The author blocked Sam's devices after he didn't pay, leading to some conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreement they had from the start. If they agreed that each would pay their share monthly, then Sam breached that agreement by not paying. The author tried to communicate and even gave warnings. Blocking access could be seen as enforcing the agreement they had. However, there's also the aspect of Sam needing internet for his coursework now. The author might be aware of that but still chose to block him, which could be seen as cutting off access to something he needs for his studies. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not the one responsible for Sam's coursework issues. The original agreement was about sharing costs, so the author's action is about enforcing payment. However, is it fair to cut off internet access when it's affecting Sam's academic work? The author might have considered alternatives, like using university libraries, but Sam claims he doesn't work well there. \n\nAlso, the argument is that the author is not being taken advantage of financially right now, but they are taking preemptive action. The author's main issue is about fairness in shared expenses. Blocking internet is a form of punishment, which might be harsh, but if it's within the boundaries of their agreement, maybe it's justified. \n\nBut wait, did they have any agreement about consequences for non-payment? If the original agreement didn't specify, maybe the author overstepped. Also, punching a wall and the subsequent complaints from Sam might complicate things, but that's his reaction to being blocked. \n\nIn terms of the AITA factor, the question is whether the author's action was reasonable. Enforcing payment is one thing, but using a method that affects Sam's academic work might be seen as going too far, especially if the author isn't directly harmed financially yet. However, if the agreement was clear and the author tried to communicate, maybe they're in the right. \n\nHmm, tricky. The author is trying to enforce a shared agreement, which is reasonable. But the method of blocking internet could be problematic if it's causing undue hardship. However, since the agreement was mutual, and the author is covering the cost, maybe it's justified. I think the answer depends on whether the action was a reasonable enforcement of the agreement. If the author had discussed alternatives first, maybe it's different. But given the circumstances, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
