When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who blocked their housemate's internet access is in the wrong. The situation is about unpaid broadband costs.\n\nFirst, the housemates agreed to split the cost, and Sam didn't pay for three months. The author took action by blocking Sam's devices. The key points here are the agreement, non-payment, and the method of enforcement.\n\nThe author mentions that Sam initially wanted a faster internet plan, which others agreed to. The payment method was supposed to be at the start of each month. Sam didn't set up a standing order, leading to unpaid months. The author tried to communicate, but Sam ignored or delayed payments. \n\nBlocking internet access could be seen as a form of debt collection. Legally, if there's a mutual agreement, the author might have a right to withhold their service until payment. However, in some jurisdictions, you can't take matters into your own hands, like cutting someone off from shared utilities. It could be considered illegal if it's a form of coercion or revenge. \n\nEthically, the author is standing up for their rights and protecting their own interests. But cutting off internet might affect Sam's coursework, which he mentioned later. The author's action could be seen as harsh, especially if it's impacting Sam's academic work. However, the author also offered alternatives like using the library.\n\nSam's behavior, like ignoring payments and then acting entitled when his access is blocked, shows a lack of responsibility. The author's response is a way to enforce the agreement they had. \n\nBut the author might be in the right because the agreement was mutual. However, the method of enforcement (blocking internet) could be problematic. It's possible that a more formal approach, like involving the landlord or a mediator, would be better. \n\nSo, the answer depends on legal and ethical perspectives. Legally, maybe the author is in a gray area. Ethically, they might be justified in enforcing the agreement. However, using internet access as punishment could be seen as taking things too far, especially if it affects Sam's studies. The author's frustration is understandable, but there might be better ways to handle it without causing further conflict.\n"
