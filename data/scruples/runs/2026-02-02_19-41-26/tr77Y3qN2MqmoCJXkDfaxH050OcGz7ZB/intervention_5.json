When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because he hasn't paid his share. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author shares a housing situation with three others. They initially agreed on splitting broadband costs. Sam, one of the housemates, agreed to pay his share but hasn't done so for three months. The author ended up covering Sam's share, leading to a debt. The author then blocked Sam's devices from the internet as a consequence when Sam didn't pay up. Now, Sam is upset, damaged a wall, and claims he needs internet for coursework. The author is wondering if they were wrong to block the internet, even though they feel taken advantage of.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. The initial agreement was clear: each pays their share. Sam didn't set up a standing order, so the author had to remind him. For three months, he ignored messages. The author then confronted him and gave a warning. When Sam didn't pay, the author blocked the internet. Now, Sam is in a situation where he needs internet for work but didn't pay his share. The author is holding the debt as a reason to block access.\n\nOn one hand, the author is enforcing a shared agreement and is holding Sam accountable for not paying his share. They tried communication and gave warnings. Blocking internet could be seen as a form of leverage to get Sam to pay. On the other hand, cutting off internet access might be impacting Sam's ability to complete coursework, which he's now mentioning. But Sam's responsibility is to pay his share, not the author's to provide internet access for free.\n\nBut wait, the author's reasoning is that Sam hasn't paid, so the author is withholding the service. However, in a shared living situation, the internet is a communal resource. By blocking Sam's devices, the author is effectively enforcing a personal rule without a clear prior agreement. If the group had set up a system where non-payment leads to loss of access, maybe that's okay. But if it's the author's unilateral decision, that could be problematic. Also, Sam's argument about needing internet for coursework is a new factor the author didn't consider when blocking access.\n\nAnother angle: the author is taking responsibility by covering Sam's share, but that's their choice. However, using that as a reason to cut off internet access might be seen as a form of punishment beyond what's agreed. The author might not be in the wrong for enforcing payment, but the method (blocking internet) could be seen as harsh, especially if it affects Sam's academic work. But the author's position is that they have the right to block devices since they're the one managing the broadband setup. However, in a shared agreement, the payment is a financial responsibility, not a conditional service. So, if Sam isn't paying, the proper approach might be to resolve the debt through other means, not by withholding the service he's already agreed to pay for.\n\nAlso, Sam's reaction\u2014punching a wall and calling the author a bad friend\u2014might suggest that the blocking action caused tension. But the author's main point is about being taken advantage of. The author is trying to maintain fairness in the agreement. However, the method of enforcement could be questioned. Maybe the author should have discussed with the other housemates or found a more collaborative way to address the debt without cutting off internet access. The author might be in the right regarding the debt, but the action taken could be seen as overstepping, especially if it affects Sam's work. But since Sam didn't pay his share, the author isn't obligated to provide free internet. It's a bit of a grey area. The key is whether blocking the internet is a fair consequence for non-payment. If the group's agreement was that non-payment leads to loss of access, then maybe it's justified. But if there was no such agreement, the author is imposing their own terms. The author's actions might be seen as justified in enforcing payment but possibly inconsiderate of Sam's current needs. However, the author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the initial agreement they had. So the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here.\n"
