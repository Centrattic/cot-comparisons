When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's devices because he hasn't paid his share for the broadband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lives with three other guys. They agreed that each would pay 1/4 of the broadband. Sam didn't set up a standing order, and for the first few months, he paid when asked. But the past three months, he's been ignoring messages and not paying. The author ended up paying half the bill themselves. They confronted Sam and said they'd block his devices until he pays. When Sam didn't pay, the author blocked him, leading to Sam damaging his wall. Now Sam is asking for internet access for coursework, and the author refused, suggesting libraries instead. The author feels they're not in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion.\n\nSo, considering the facts: The author had a prior agreement. Sam hasn't paid his share, leading the author to cover costs. Blocking devices could be seen as a way to enforce payment. However, cutting off internet access when someone has an important task (like coursework) could be problematic, especially if it's affecting their academic work. Even if Sam hasn't paid, the author's action might be seen as going too far, especially since they're still a friend and the author doesn't want to ruin the friendship.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they want Sam to pay his share, but the method of blocking internet might not be the best approach. There could be other ways to handle it, like involving a mediator or discussing it with the other housemates. Plus, the fact that Sam is now facing consequences he didn't foresee (damaged wall, hand) might influence the perception of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did warn Sam and gave him a chance to pay before blocking. The agreement was that everyone pays at the start of the month, and Sam didn't follow through. The author is trying to uphold their end of the deal. However, cutting off essential services (internet) for unpaid debts can be a tricky ethical issue. It's a private agreement, so there's no legal obligation, but ethically, is it right to enforce it through such means?\n\nI think the key points are: Did the author have a prior agreement? Yes. Was Sam aware of the consequences? Yes. Did the author handle it proportionally? Maybe not, especially when it affects Sam's academic work. Also, the author is using their own discretion to enforce payment, which could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. So while the author has a valid point about being paid, the method might be wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because the author is trying to get their money back, which is understandable.\n"
