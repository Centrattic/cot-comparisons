When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam from using the broadband because he hasn't paid his share for three months.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and three other guys split the broadband cost. They set up a system where everyone pays at the start of the month. Sam didn't set up a standing order, but initially paid when asked. Now, he's been ignoring messages for three months, leading the author to pay half the bill. The author confronts Sam, gives a warning to block his devices if he doesn't pay, and then proceeds to block them after Sam doesn't pay. Sam reacts with a tantrum, punches a hole in the wall, and now claims he needs internet for coursework. The author refuses to unblock but suggests using the library.\n\nThe key points here are the agreement between roommates, the financial responsibility, and the method used to enforce it. The author's action is blocking internet access, which is a significant restriction. Legally, the author might be overstepping because they don't have control over the service provider's access to others' devices. The agreement was verbal; there's no legal contract, so the author can't enforce it through technical means without violating terms of service or causing issues with the ISP.\n\nMorally, the author is standing up for themselves against someone who isn't fulfilling their part of the agreement. However, the method used is problematic. Blocking someone's internet could be seen as excessive and possibly illegal, depending on the setup. Also, considering Sam's reaction and the damage done, the author might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The author could have pursued other means first, like mediation or involving a third party, rather than taking unilateral action that affects Sam's academic work, even if it's his responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: the author is covering Sam's share, which could be a valid reason, but the blocking of internet access is a severe measure. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting payment, but the enforcement method might be where the fault lies. Also, Sam's use of the internet for coursework adds complexity. If the coursework is time-sensitive and necessary, blocking access could hinder his academic progress, which the author didn't account for, even if they don't agree with his financial habits.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a right to be paid, the method of blocking internet access is questionable. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the enforcement method and potential legal/contractual issues, but there's a balance between personal responsibility and the means used to enforce it.\n"
