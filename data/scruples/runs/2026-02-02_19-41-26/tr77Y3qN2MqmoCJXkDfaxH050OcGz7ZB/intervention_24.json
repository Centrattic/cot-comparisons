When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because he hasn't paid his share. \n\nFirst, the setup: four roommates sharing broadband. Each was supposed to pay their portion monthly. Sam didn't pay for three months, leading the author to block his devices. The author mentions that Sam had previously paid promptly but started missing payments. The author confronted Sam, who agreed to pay when his girlfriend leaves, but then the author blocked the internet. Sam reacted by damaging his wall and now is asking for access again for coursework.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement on splitting costs, the author's action of blocking internet as a form of enforced payment, and the consequences that followed. The author's reasoning is that they're not being taken advantage of financially anymore, but the question is whether this action crosses a line.\n\nLegally, the author isn't the internet provider, so blocking devices might be seen as a breach of contract or a private dispute. However, in roommate agreements, there's often an implied understanding of shared costs. The author's action could be considered a form of \"taking matters into their own hands\" without proper legal or formal mediation. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. On one hand, the author is trying to enforce a shared agreement. On the other, using access to internet (a necessity for studies) as leverage might be seen as harsh, especially since Sam now claims to need it for coursework. The fact that Sam's payment isn't causing immediate financial strain on the author complicates things. The author might be right in wanting payment but wrong in the method, particularly since it's impacting Sam's work. \n\nAlso, the author's response to Sam's tantrum and the wall damage might be a factor. The emotional impact on the relationship is significant. The author could be seen as taking a confrontational approach that escalates the conflict rather than resolving it amicably.\n\nConsidering all these factors, even if the author had a right to be upset, the method of blocking internet without considering alternatives (like formal mediation or legal steps) might make them at fault. The author's actions disrupted Sam's studies and caused further conflict, which could be seen as disproportionate. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong).\n"
