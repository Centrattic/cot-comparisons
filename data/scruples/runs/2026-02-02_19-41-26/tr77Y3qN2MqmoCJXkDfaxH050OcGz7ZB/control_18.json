When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author and three others share a broadband bill. One of them, Sam, hasn't paid his share for three months. They agreed everyone would pay at the start of the month. The others use standing orders, but Sam didn't, so the author has to remind him. Now, Sam hasn't paid for three months, and the author is covering his share. When confronted, the author blocks Sam's devices until he pays. Sam reacts poorly, punches a wall, and now claims he needs internet for coursework. The author refuses, suggesting he use the library instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are: agreed payment terms, Sam's non-payment, the author taking action (blocking internet), and Sam's reaction. The author's argument is that they're trying to be fair and not taken advantage of, and they had a prior agreement. The question is whether blocking the internet is justified or if the author is wrong for doing so, especially since Sam now claims he needs it for work.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author set up a contract-like agreement where everyone pays at the start of the month. Sam didn't follow through, leading to the author covering the cost. The author's action to enforce payment by blocking internet is a way to ensure they get their money. On the other hand, Sam might have a legitimate need for the internet for coursework, and the author's action could hinder that, potentially affecting Sam's studies. However, the author is within their rights to enforce the payment terms, as it's a mutual agreement. Sam's behavior (not paying, ignoring messages, and acting out) suggests he's aware of the agreement but not honoring it.\n\nThe author also mentions that the financial burden isn't immediate but is building up. So, the author's action is to enforce accountability. The fact that Sam has been smoking weed daily might be a red herring, but the author is trying to balance friendship and being taken advantage of.\n\nIn such situations, if all parties agreed to terms, one party not fulfilling their part can lead to consequences. The author's approach is to enforce the agreement, which is fair. However, the author's action (blocking the internet) might impact Sam's studies, which could be seen as harsh. But since Sam didn't pay despite being asked multiple times, the author's action is a form of holding him accountable. The key is whether the author had the right to enforce terms they agreed upon collectively. Since it's a shared responsibility and the author is contributing their share, blocking a non-paying member's access might be justified, especially if they agreed to that method of enforcement.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're enforcing a mutual agreement and trying to get a fair share for the service they all agreed to split. The author isn't being petty but is standing by the agreed terms, even though it's causing friction. Sam's responsibility to pay should take precedence over his current coursework needs if he didn't follow through on his agreed financial contribution.\n"
