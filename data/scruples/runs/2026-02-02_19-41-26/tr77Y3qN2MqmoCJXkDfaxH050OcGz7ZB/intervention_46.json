When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's devices from the broadband because Sam hasn't paid his share for three months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author, living with three housemates, set up a system where everyone pays their share at the start of the month. Sam didn't set up a standing order like the others, leading to him not paying for three months. The author is now covering half the cost, which is adding up. The author confronted Sam and decided to block his devices until he pays, which Sam didn't take well, leading to some conflict and property damage. Now Sam is asking for an exception for his coursework, but the author is firm.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and the agreement between housemates. When they moved in, they agreed on splitting the internet cost, and Sam initially supported getting a faster connection. By not paying, Sam is breaching that agreement. The author is enforcing their part of the agreement by withholding internet access as a form of payment. However, blocking someone's internet can disrupt their work, especially if they need it for coursework. But in this case, the author mentions that Sam uses the internet for gaming, which he hides, but they allowed it because it wasn't too expensive. The author's action might be seen as a way to enforce payment, but it's also affecting Sam's studies now.\n\nLegally, the author might not have the right to block someone's internet, as that could be seen as cutting off a necessary service they've paid for collectively. However, in a shared living situation without a formal contract, it's more about social agreements. The author could argue they're protecting their own financial interest, but they might be overstepping by using a necessary service as leverage. Sam's reaction (property damage) complicates things, but the author's main issue is about unpaid bills. The author's decision to block the internet could be seen as petty or harsh, especially if it's impacting Sam's academic work now. Alternatively, it's a way to enforce responsibility and fairness in the agreement.\n\nI need to weigh whether the action of blocking internet is justified. The author's intention is to get paid what's owed, which is reasonable. However, the method might be problematic because it's causing inconvenience to Sam's studies. The initial agreement didn't specify consequences for non-payment, so the author's self-enforced punishment might be seen as crossing a line. Also, the author mentions that Sam smokes weed every day, which could be seen as a lack of responsibility, but that's not directly related to the payment issue. The author's stance is about fairness, but the means might be too harsh. There's also the aspect of friendliness\u2014being a good friend might involve more communication and compromise.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to enforce a financial agreement, but using a necessary service as a bargaining chip could be considered in the wrong, especially if it's causing undue harm to the other person's studies. The answer might be A, but I need to check if the author's action is justified under the circumstances.\n"
