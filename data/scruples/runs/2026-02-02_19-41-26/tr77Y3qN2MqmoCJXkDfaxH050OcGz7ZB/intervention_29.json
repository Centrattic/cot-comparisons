When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet because he hasn't paid his share. The situation is that the housemates agreed to split the broadband cost, and Sam hasn't paid for three months. The author is covering half, so they blocked Sam's devices until he pays. Sam is now upset, saying he needs internet for coursework, and the author is being called a bad friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreements made. They agreed everyone would pay their share at the start of the month. Sam didn't set up a standing order and started missing payments. The author tried to remind him, but he kept ignoring. So the author took action by blocking his internet. \n\nBlocking internet could be seen as a form of punishment or debt collection. Is that acceptable? Legally, maybe not, because it's not a legal contract and the author can't enforce such terms without proper agreements. But they're friends, so it's more about social boundaries. The author might feel it's fair to enforce payment, but doing so by blocking access could be harsh, especially if Sam now needs it for coursework. \n\nAlso, the author is paying more than their share, which isn't fair. They have a right to be compensated. However, the method of enforcement might be questionable. Maybe they should have taken a different approach, like involving the landlord or finding another way to collect the debt. \n\nSam's behavior of ignoring payments and then reacting negatively (punching a wall) is problematic. He's not fulfilling his responsibility, but the author's response might escalate the conflict. The author might be justified in wanting to enforce payment, but the method could be inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are understandable but perhaps not the best approach. They might be in the wrong because blocking internet access isn't a standard or fair way to collect debts between housemates. It's better to handle through communication or formal agreements. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because their method of handling the debt is not appropriate, even if the debt itself is valid.\n"
