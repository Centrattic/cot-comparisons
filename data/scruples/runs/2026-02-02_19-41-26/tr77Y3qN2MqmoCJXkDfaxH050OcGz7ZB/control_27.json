When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because the housemate hasn't paid his share. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe setup is that there are four roommates sharing broadband. They agreed each would pay their quarter at the start of the month. Sam didn't pay for three months, and the writer is covering his share. The writer blocked Sam's devices after he didn't pay, leading to some conflict. Sam is now upset, did some damage, and is asking for internet access for coursework. The writer is torn between feeling taken advantage of and not wanting to ruin a friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the writer have the right to block Sam's internet? The agreement was that everyone pays their share. Sam didn't, so the writer is covering it. The problem is that the writer took unilateral action by blocking access, which affected Sam's coursework. Even though the writer might feel justified, taking away internet access could interfere with Sam's studies, even if it's also affecting the writer financially.\n\nBut wait, the writer mentions that Sam is using the faster internet plan because he thought he needed it for studying, though he actually plays games. The writer might feel that Sam isn't contributing but still using the service. However, the writer's action of blocking devices could be seen as cutting off someone's access to necessary resources, especially if it's for coursework. The university might have policies on this, or there could be other ways to handle the debt without cutting off services. Also, the writer is using Sam's unpaid share to cover half of the bill, so maybe they're not directly out of pocket, but it's still a shared responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: Did the writer have a prior agreement on consequences for non-payment? If the housemates didn't set that up beforehand, then acting unilaterally might be seen as overstepping. Also, Sam's reaction (tantrum, damaging the wall) might indicate that blocking internet was a harsh measure. The writer's intention was to get payment, but maybe there's a better way, like involving the other roommates or using a more formal method.\n\nThe writer mentions that the other housemates set up standing orders, but Sam didn't. So maybe the writer was the one collecting, and when Sam didn't pay, the writer took it upon themselves to block access. However, without consensus from the others, this could be problematic. Also, the writer is now facing Sam's claims about the damage affecting deposits and his coursework. It might be that the writer's actions are causing more issues, like potential deposit deductions, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the writer might be justified in wanting payment, but blocking access without a prior agreement and causing disruption to someone's studies could be seen as taking it too far. The writer could have handled it differently, perhaps by discussing with the other housemates or finding alternative solutions. The fact that Sam is still a friend and the writer doesn't want to ruin the friendship suggests that the action was a last resort, but maybe not the best approach.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because taking unilateral action to cut off services that affect another's academic work is not appropriate, even if the other person hasn't paid their share. There should be agreed-upon consequences beforehand, and the writer's action might be seen as excessive.\n"
