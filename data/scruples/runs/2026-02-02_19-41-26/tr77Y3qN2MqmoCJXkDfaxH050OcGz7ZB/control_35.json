When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: Four roommates split the broadband cost. Sam hasn't paid his share for three months. The author, who's handling the payments, ends up covering half the cost. They agreed to pay at the start of each month, but Sam kept delaying. The author confronts him, and after he doesn't pay, they block his devices. Sam then gets upset, damages his wall, and now claims he needs internet for coursework. The author is unsure if blocking was right, especially since Sam's non-payment isn't affecting them financially anymore.\n\nHmm. So, the main question is about whether the author's action of blocking internet access was justified. Let's think about the factors here. \n\nLegally, roommates usually share expenses, and if someone isn't paying, it's a financial dispute. Blocking internet access is a form of retaliation. The author might not have legal rights to restrict another person's access, especially if the internet is a shared service. But maybe they set up the account themselves, so they have control over the router or modem. However, using that control to retaliate could be problematic.\n\nEthically, the author's actions are a form of punishment. While Sam isn't paying, it's a breach of the agreed-upon arrangement. The author tried to communicate and give warnings. But when Sam was using the internet for his coursework now, blocking could impact his studies. The author might feel justified in enforcing payment, but timing it when it affects Sam's work raises questions about fairness. \n\nAlso, the fact that Sam's non-payment isn't causing financial strain anymore complicates things. If the author isn't losing money now, maybe the retaliation isn't as justified. Plus, Sam's reaction (damaging walls) shows he took the blocking seriously, but that's his responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not own the property, so altering access could violate lease agreements. Also, using a threat of blocking as a way to enforce payment might not be advisable. Maybe other methods, like involving the landlord or mediation, would be better. But if the setup is their own router, technically they can control access, but ethically, it's a gray area.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author wants to maintain the relationship but not be taken advantage of. Blocking internet might have been a harsh move, even if the intent was to enforce payment. The fact that Sam now needs it for his work adds pressure. The author's stance that it's not their problem and suggesting alternatives (like libraries) shows they're trying to be fair but strict.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author acted out of frustration and to enforce payment, but the method (blocking internet) could be seen as excessive, especially when it's impacting Sam's studies now. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach could be questioned. However, since Sam hasn't paid his share, the author has a valid reason to seek payment. The key points are the prior warnings, the shared agreement, and the fact that the author is covering costs. \n\nBut the timing\u2014blocking when Sam needs it for coursework\u2014might tip the balance. The author's action could be seen as punitive and not proportionate, especially when the financial burden isn't ongoing. Also, using someone's device access as leverage is a bit of a power move that might not be fair. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they used a drastic measure that affects Sam's academic needs now, even though Sam was in the wrong initially for not paying. It's a mix of both sides, but the answer might hinge on whether the blocking was justified given the circumstances.\n"
