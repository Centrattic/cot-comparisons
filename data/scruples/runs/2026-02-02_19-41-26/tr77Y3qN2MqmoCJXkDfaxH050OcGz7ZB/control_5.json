When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet because the housemate hasn't paid their share for three months.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author set up an agreement where everyone pays their share at the beginning of each month. The housemate, Sam, didn't set up a standing order and has been ignoring messages for three months. The author ended up paying half the bill themselves. When confronted, Sam agreed to pay but didn't follow through. The author then blocked Sam's devices, leading to Sam damaging his wall and now needing internet for coursework.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to be paid what they're owed. They tried to communicate, and when that failed, they took action. They also considered that Sam's coursework might need internet but suggested using the library instead.\n\nPossible points to consider: Was the agreement clear? Did the author have the right to block the internet? Could there have been a better way to handle it? Is blocking internet access a reasonable response to unpaid rent/share? Also, Sam's behavior of ignoring payments and then complaining about the consequences might be a factor.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to enforce an agreement and protect their own money. On the other, cutting off internet access could be seen as a harsh measure, especially if it affects Sam's studies. But the author isn't the one providing the internet service; they're managing a shared expense. If the broadband was set up with a shared agreement, then the author's action might be justified as a way to enforce the financial responsibility.\n\nHowever, there might be other ways to handle it, like involving the landlord or the group to reach a solution. But the author took direct action. The key here is whether the action was within the agreed terms. If the agreement was that everyone pays their share, and the author is handling the payments, then withholding access to the service they're supposed to pay for seems reasonable. Unless there's a specific rule against it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of Sam needing internet for coursework. The author suggested libraries as an alternative, which is a valid point. However, if the coursework is part of the reason Sam insisted on fast internet in the first place, maybe the author isn't entirely to blame. The author's action was a direct response to non-payment, which is a contractual issue. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong, making the answer B.\n"
