When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who blocked their housemate's internet is in the wrong. The situation involves Sam not paying his share of the broadband for three months. The author blocked his devices after getting no payment, even though Sam has an important piece of work to do now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreements made. They initially agreed everyone would pay their share at the beginning of each month. Sam didn't set up a standing order, but he usually paid when reminded. The problem is the past three months of non-payment. The author is covering Sam's share, which adds up.Blocking the internet seems like a way to enforce payment, but is it justified?\n\nSam's current issue is that he needs internet for coursework. However, the author points out that Sam has been smoking weed daily and hasn't been proactive. Also, when confronted, Sam laughed at the author's seriousness and then acted out. The author might feel taken advantage of.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off internet access could hinder Sam's academic work. But the original agreement was about splitting costs, and Sam's non-payment is a breach. The author tried to resolve it before blocking, giving him chances. The response from Sam was dismissive and led to a tantrum with property damage. \n\nThe key points are the prior agreement, Sam's repeated failure to pay despite reminders, and the author's attempt to enforce the agreement. Blocking internet is a form of leverage, but it affects Sam's studies now. However, the author might have a valid point about being fair and not subsidizing Sam's expenses indefinitely. \n\nBut is blocking internet an appropriate action? It's a bit of a punishment and could be seen as taking matters into one's own hands, especially since there's no legal agreement. The author might be overstepping, even if the intent is to enforce payment. However, considering the context of prior warnings and Sam's non-cooperation, the author might feel justified. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the action was a reasonable enforcement of the agreement or an unfair punishment. Since the author had tried communication and Sam didn't comply, blocking might be seen as a last resort. However, the immediate impact on Sam's coursework is a negative consequence. Still, the author's right to enforce payment isn't clear-cut without a formal agreement. So, the author might be in the wrong for taking unilateral action that affects Sam's academic work, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n"
