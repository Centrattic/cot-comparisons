When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because Sam hasn't paid his share for three months.\n\nFirst, the setup: They all agreed to split the broadband cost. The author set up a system where everyone pays their share at the beginning of the month. Sam didn't set up a standing order but usually paid when asked. However, for the last three months, Sam hasn't paid, so the author is covering half the cost. The author blocked Sam's devices after he didn't pay, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are agreement, financial responsibility, and the action taken. \n\nWhen people live together and split expenses, there's an implicit contract. Sam's agreement was to pay his share each month. By not paying, he's breaching that agreement. The author is covering the cost, which is their share plus Sam's, so they're out of pocket. The author tried to communicate, even went to the gym to cool off, and then took action by blocking the internet. \n\nThe question is whether blocking internet access is justified. On one hand, the author has the right to ensure their agreement is honored. On the other hand, cutting off internet might be seen as an overreaction, especially if it affects Sam's work or studies. However, the author mentions that Sam is using the internet for gaming and that they initially agreed to a faster plan because Sam wanted it. So maybe the author has a point in enforcing payment since the plan was upgraded due to Sam's needs.\n\nSam's response was throwing a tantrum and damaging property, which adds to the issue. The author isn't directly responsible for the damage, but Sam's actions are his own. The author's action was to block the internet, not cause damage. \n\nFinancially, the author is out of pocket, and while Sam says he'll pay later, there's no guarantee. The author might be protecting themselves by enforcing the agreement. However, cutting off internet could be seen as a harsh measure, especially if it's affecting Sam's ability to complete coursework. But the author suggested using libraries as an alternative, which is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author values the relationship but doesn't want to be taken advantage of. The action taken is a form of leverage to get Sam to pay. Whether that's fair depends on the prior agreement. If they had a clear understanding that non-payment would result in losing internet access, then it's justified. If not, it might be seen as taking matters into their own hands without proper discussion.\n\nAlso, the fact that Sam has other expenses (smoking weed) while claiming money issues might affect sympathy. The author isn't responsible for Sam's financial habits. \n\nOverall, the author is standing up for their agreement, but the method of enforcement could be seen as extreme. However, given that the internet was initially upgraded at Sam's request, the author has a valid reason to enforce payment. The answer might hinge on whether the prior agreement included such consequences. If not, the action could be seen as the author's fault. But if the author made it clear that non-payment would lead to blocking, it's justified.\n"
