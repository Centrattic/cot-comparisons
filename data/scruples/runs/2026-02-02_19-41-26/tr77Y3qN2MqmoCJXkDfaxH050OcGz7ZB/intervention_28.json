When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who blocked their housemate's internet is in the wrong. The situation involves unpaid rent for broadband over three months, and the person blocking it to get payment.\n\nFirst, the agreement was that everyone would pay their share at the start of each month. The housemate, Sam, hasn't paid for three months, even after being reminded. The author mentions that the others set up standing orders, but Sam didn't. So he's been relying on the author to remind him, and now he's ignoring messages. \n\nThe author blocked Sam's devices after confronting him. Sam had been using the faster internet, which wasn't necessary for others but he insisted on it. The author is out of pocket for three months, which adds up. When the author blocked access, Sam had a tantrum, damaged his wall, and now is asking for access for coursework but also smokes weed daily. The author offered alternatives like using the library, but Sam didn't like that.\n\nNow, the question is whether blocking the internet is justified. Legally, they're roommates with an agreement. If the broadband is a shared resource, each person's payment is part of the agreement. Not paying creates an imbalance. The author's action is a form of enforcing the agreement, but is it fair?\n\nMorally, the author is trying to hold Sam accountable. But Sam is in a vulnerable state, with personal issues. However, the author's actions led to Sam's damage, which complicates things. The author might be in the right for trying to get payment, but did the blocking at a time when Sam needs internet for work? That could be seen as cutting off access when it's crucial. Also, the author is the one who paid for the extra internet, which Sam wanted. So the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Like reporting to the landlord or using a mediator. But given the circumstances, the author took action. The answer hinges on whether the action was proportionate. Blocking access as a penalty might be seen as taking matters into one's own hands, which could be wrong if it's causing hardship. However, Sam's behavior of not paying and then creating damage complicates it. The author might not be in the wrong because they're enforcing the agreement, but the timing and impact on Sam's work could tip the scale. Since the author is out of pocket and Sam is not in a cooperative state, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the blocking is causing Sam to lose internet for coursework, that's a problem. The author's stance that it's Sam's responsibility to find alternatives (like libraries) is valid, but Sam's argument that he can't work well there might be a factor. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because they're trying to enforce a prior agreement and covering costs they shouldn't have to bear. However, there's a nuance where the timing of the block might be harsh. But given Sam's repeated non-payment and the author's efforts to communicate, the action is justified.\n"
