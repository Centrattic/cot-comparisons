When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because he hasn't paid his share. The situation involves a group of four roommates sharing broadband. They agreed on splitting the cost, but Sam hasn't paid for three months. The author, along with others, set up a system where everyone pays at the beginning of the month. Sam didn't set up a standing order and started skipping payments. The author confronted him and blocked his devices when he didn't pay, leading to some conflict and Sam damaging his wall.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the agreement was for everyone to pay their share each month. Sam didn't pay, leading to the author covering his share. The author then took action by blocking the internet. The question is whether this action was justified.\n\nFirst, the agreement they had was explicit. Even though Sam didn't set up a standing order, he was supposed to pay manually each month. The author gave him chances to pay, but he didn't. The author's reasoning is that they're covering the cost, so blocking the internet is a way to enforce payment. However, cutting off someone's access to a shared resource might be seen as retaliatory. \n\nBut here's the thing: the internet was a shared expense, and the agreement was that all would contribute. If someone isn't paying, using the resource without contributing could be considered unfair. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of. However, the method of enforcement\u2014blocking access\u2014could be problematic. It's a form of punishment without prior agreement. \n\nAdditionally, Sam had important coursework that requires internet access. The author's action might affect Sam's academic work, which complicates things. Even though the author suggested libraries as an alternative, that might not be feasible for Sam. The author's justification is about enforcing payment, but the consequences could be more than they intended. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did give warnings before blocking the devices. They had a conversation where Sam agreed to pay, then didn't follow through. The author's action was a direct consequence of Sam's non-payment. However, the blocking might be seen as a breach of trust or a violation of the initial agreement, since the problem was financial and not about usage. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the group agreed on splitting the cost, then not paying is a breach. The author's action is a way to enforce that agreement. But using a shared resource as a lever might be considered harsh, especially if it affects someone's studies. There's also the aspect of friendship; the author mentions still considering Sam a friend but feeling taken advantage of. \n\nLegally, if the agreement was clear and Sam isn't fulfilling his part, the author is within their rights to seek payment. However, the method of enforcement (blocking internet) might not be the best approach. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author is protecting their own interests but in a way that could harm another person's academic or personal responsibilities. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but considering the context\u2014the agreement, prior warnings, and the fact that the others split the cost\u2014it's possible the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the blocking action might be seen as too extreme, especially affecting Sam's coursework. The author's solution might have been harsh, but the core issue of unpaid contributions isn't right. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author is in a tough spot. They have a valid reason to expect payment, but the enforcement method could be problematic. But if the agreement was clear and the others are covering Sam's share, then the author isn't wrong for trying to enforce it. However, the blocking might be seen as a harsh measure. But given the prior warnings and the agreement, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
