When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because the housemate hasn't paid his share.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person (let's call them the author) lives with three others, including Sam. They agreed to split broadband costs. Sam didn't pay for three months, so the author blocked his devices. Sam then had a tantrum, damaged the wall, and now claims he needs internet for coursework. The author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points are: agreed payment, Sam's non-payment, the author taking action by blocking access, and Sam's reaction. Also, Sam's argument that he needs internet for work now.\n\nThe author's defense is that they confronted Sam and gave him a chance to pay, but he didn't. The author blocked the internet as a consequence. But Sam is arguing he needs it for coursework, even though he's been avoiding payment for months. Also, the author mentions that the cost is adding up, but now Sam wants access for his coursework while not paying.\n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to block the internet. Legally, if they're all sharing the broadband, the author might not own the router or the contract. So blocking someone's devices could be a breach of their agreement. But maybe the author set up the internet and is handling payments. However, even if the author set it up, others might still have rights to access, especially if they contribute to the cost.\n\nSam's non-payment is a problem, but if the author blocked the devices without a prior agreement on consequences, maybe that's where the issue is. The author might have the right to collect the money, but cutting off access could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, especially if Sam has a legitimate need now. Also, Sam's reaction (tantrum, damaging the wall) complicates things. The author might feel justified because Sam was being irresponsible, but the method of blocking could be seen as harsh.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a good friend but doesn't want to feel taken advantage of. However, the action taken affects Sam's ability to do his work now, even if he's been neglecting payments. The author might be in the right for trying to enforce payment, but the timing of the block (when Sam needs internet for coursework) could be problematic. Maybe the blocking is a form of coercion, which isn't effective and harms their friendship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Sam smokes weed daily, which might be a factor in his financial problems, but that's not relevant to the payment issue. The key is whether the author's action of blocking is fair. If they had a prior agreement that non-payment would lead to internet blocking, then maybe it's justified. But if not, it's more of a personal choice to take control, which could be seen as wrong because it's affecting Sam's studies without legal or agreed-upon grounds.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong because they tried to enforce payment terms they agreed upon, but the method and timing might be questionable. However, taking away internet access without a clear prior agreement on consequences could be seen as overstepping, especially when it impacts someone's academic work. The answer might depend on whether the blocking was a pre-agreed consequence or an impulsive decision.\n"
