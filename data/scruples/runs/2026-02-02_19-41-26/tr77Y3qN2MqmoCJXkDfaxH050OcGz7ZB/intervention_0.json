When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they live with three other housemates, including Sam. They agreed that everyone would pay their share of the broadband at the start of each month. Sam hasn't paid for the past three months, and the author blocked his devices from the internet. Sam is now upset, did some damage to his room, and is asking for more time to pay. The author is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the agreement they had. They all agreed to pay their share at the beginning of the month. Sam didn't set up a standing order like the others, so the author had to message him each month. For the first few months, Sam paid when reminded, but now he's been ignoring messages and not paying. The author confronted him, said they'd block his devices if he didn't pay, and then followed through when he didn't send the money. Sam responded with a tantrum, punched a wall, and now claims he needs the internet for coursework.\n\nThe author argues that they were just enforcing the agreement and that Sam not paying is affecting them financially. But they also mention that Sam has a coursework deadline and that blocking the internet might affect his work. The author is conflicted between feeling taken advantage of and not wanting to ruin a friendship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the initial agreement was clear: everyone pays their share. If Sam hasn't paid, the author is within their right to take action, especially if they agreed on the terms. However, blocking someone's internet access is a bit of a heavy-handed approach, especially if it's affecting their studies. The author might have considered other options first, like involving the other housemates or the landlord, or setting a clear timeline for payment before taking action. Also, the fact that Sam has prior issues (like being dropped from the rugby team and a breakup) might indicate he's going through a tough time, which could have been a factor in his non-payment. \n\nBut the agreement was mutual, and the author followed through after warning Sam. However, the author's actions led to Sam damaging his property, which could lead to more issues. The author's intention was to enforce payment, but the method might have been too harsh, especially if Sam genuinely needs the internet for his coursework now. Also, the author's response to Sam's coursework request by suggesting he use the library might be practical, but it's a bit dismissive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has a right to expect payment, but their method of enforcement could be questioned. The blocking action might be justified given the agreement, but the timing and impact on Sam's studies might be a problem. However, the author was in a position where they were covering Sam's share, which is their money, so they might feel justified. On the other hand, the author could have handled it more diplomatically. So, the answer might depend on whether the action was proportional to the issue. The author's actions might be seen as taking it too far, especially since the non-payment isn't impacting their finances now, and they still consider Sam a friend. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they escalated the situation without considering alternatives, leading to conflict and damage. Alternatively, they might not be in the wrong because they were enforcing the agreed terms. Hmm.\n"
