When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author and Sam are roommates. They agreed that each would pay a quarter of the broadband cost at the beginning of each month. The others set up standing orders, but Sam didn't. The author initially didn't mind since Sam would pay after being reminded. However, Sam hasn't paid for three months, leading the author to block his devices. Sam then reacted by damaging the wall and now claims he needs internet for coursework.\n\nThe author's main points are about fairness and being taken advantage of. They want payment for the service. Blocking the internet is their way of enforcing payment. But Sam argues he needs it for work and can't pay immediately.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Is blocking someone's internet access a reasonable action? It's a digital necessity for many, especially students. If Sam's coursework requires it, cutting off access could hinder his studies. However, the author is not the one providing the internet; they're just blocking devices. The broadband is a shared expense, so using it to enforce payment might be harsh.\n\nAlso, the author is paying more than their share, which is unfair. But the method of enforcement\u2014blocking internet\u2014might be seen as disproportionate, especially if it's affecting Sam's academic work. The author's approach could be seen as taking matters into their own hands without resolving the issue through communication or involving others, like the landlord or a mediator.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a prior agreement and tried to remind Sam. The blocking could be a last resort after repeated failures to collect. However, the fact that Sam is now in a crisis (wall damage, injured hand) due to the blocking complicates things. It might have caused more harm than intended.\n\nEthically, while Sam is in the wrong for not paying, the author's method of enforcing payment might not be the best. There are more constructive ways, like involving the landlord, splitting the cost differently, or charging him later. Blocking internet access disrupts Sam's studies and could lead to resentment, even if the author feels justified.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's action, though stemming from a place of trying to be fair, might be considered in the wrong because the method used is harmful and potentially counterproductive. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
