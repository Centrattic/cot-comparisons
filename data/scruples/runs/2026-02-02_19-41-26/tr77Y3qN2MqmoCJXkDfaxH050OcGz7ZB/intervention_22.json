When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for months.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The four housemates agreed that each would pay their share of the broadband at the beginning of each month. Sam hasn't paid for three months, so the author is covering half the cost. The author blocked Sam's devices until he pays, leading to some conflict where Sam damaged a wall. Now Sam says he has coursework needing internet and can't pay yet, but he smokes weed daily and uses the internet for gaming. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for blocking the internet.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, the author is trying to enforce a pre-agreed payment system. Sam agreed to pay his share but hasn't, which is causing financial strain. The author's action is to cut off internet access until payment is made. However, the author is now questioning if this is right, especially when Sam claims he needs the internet for coursework. But the story mentions that Sam plays games and the author already knows he's using the internet for that.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the author have the right to block the internet as a form of payment enforcement? 2) Is it fair to cut off someone's internet access, especially when they might need it for schoolwork? 3) Are there other factors, like Sam's habits (smoking weed) that might affect the judgment?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for their agreement and not letting Sam off the hook for his financial responsibility. On the other hand, cutting off internet access might be seen as a harsh measure, especially if it affects Sam's studies. However, the story also mentions that Sam's need for the internet was for a game that others didn't know about, which might suggest that his academic needs aren't as pressing as he claims. Plus, he has access to libraries if needed.\n\nAnother angle: the author is using their own resources (the broadband) to enforce payment. Since the broadband is a shared resource, the author might not have the authority to block others from using it, even if they haven't paid. This could be a privacy or fairness issue if the author is the one making decisions about internet access.\n\nBut then again, if the agreement was that each person pays their share, and the author is the one paying the bill, it's reasonable for them to enforce the agreement. However, using a technical block (like MAC address filtering) to cut off someone's internet might be a personal and punitive action rather than a collaborative solution. Maybe the author should have involved all housemates or taken a more collective approach.\n\nAlso, Sam's reaction\u2014damaging property and calling the author a bad friend\u2014adds complexity. The author might feel justified in their actions, but the method could be seen as taking matters into their own hands without resolving the issue through communication or involving others.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the author's action is within the agreed-upon terms (like a collective agreement to cut off access for non-payment), then it's fair. But since it was the author's unilateral decision without broader agreement, it might be seen as overstepping their role. Additionally, blocking internet access could be more disruptive than necessary, especially if there are other ways to handle the debt, like collecting the money and then allowing access.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they took a personal and aggressive action without collective agreement, even if the underlying issue (non-payment) is valid. The method of enforcement could be inappropriate, and there might be better ways to handle the debt without affecting Sam's studies if that's a real issue. Alternatively, if the agreement was clear and the author is acting within their rights, then maybe not. But given the information, the action seems harsh and possibly not the right approach.\n"
