When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's devices from the broadband because Sam hasn't paid his share for three months. \n\nFirst, the situation: They all agreed to split the broadband cost, Sam didn't pay, and the author took matters into their own hands by blocking access. The key points here are about responsibility, agreements, and fairness.\n\nSam didn't set up a standing order as others did, so the author had to remind him each month. Initially, he paid quickly, but then ignored or delayed payments for three months. The author confronted him, gave a warning, and then blocked the devices when Sam didn't pay. Sam reacted poorly, damaging a wall, and now he's asking for an exception because he needs the internet for coursework. \n\nLegally, if the broadband is a shared expense, all should contribute. The author is covering Sam's share, which is unfair. However, the author's method of enforcement (blocking devices) might be questionable, especially if it affects Sam's academic work. The author might argue that they're enforcing the agreement, but Sam's inability to pay might stem from his current financial issues, even if he has expenses like weed. \n\nMorality-wise, the author is standing up for their own contributions, which is reasonable. But cutting off access when it impacts someone's studies could be seen as harsh. Sam's behavior (ignoring payments, damaging property) complicates things. The author might feel justified, but the consequences of their action (blocking internet affecting coursework) could make them appear in the wrong, especially if they knew about Sam's coursework needs beforehand. \n\nAlso, the author's actions led to Sam's outburst and damage, which the author might be partially responsible for. There's a balance between holding others accountable and being considerate. The author tried to resolve it amicably first, but the blocking might be seen as taking it too far. However, without a prior agreement on what to do if someone doesn't pay, the author's action could be within their rights to protect their own expenses.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a point in wanting payment, the method of enforcement and the resulting impact on Sam's work might make them partly at fault. But if the agreement was clear and the author followed through after warnings, it's a gray area. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they tried to resolve it first and enforced a collective agreement, but there's a case for A if the blocking is seen as disproportionate. However, given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
