When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who blocked their housemate's internet is in the wrong. The situation is that Sam hasn't paid his share of the broadband for three months. The author blocked his devices because of this. The others have a standing order, but Sam didn't. The author agreed to let him pay manually at first, but now he's not paying. The author confronted him and blocked the devices after he didn't pay, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The group agreed everyone would pay at the start of the month. Sam didn't set up a standing order, which might mean he's more likely to forget or avoid paying. The author tried to remind him, but he kept ignoring. The author then blocked the devices, which led to Sam damaging his wall.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the author have the right to block the internet? 2) Was blocking it a reasonable response to non-payment? 3) Did the author consider alternatives before taking action?\n\nIn terms of fairness, if everyone agreed to split the costs, not paying is a breach of that agreement. The author might feel justified in enforcing payment. However, blocking internet access could hinder Sam's academic work, especially if he needs it for coursework. But the author argues it's his own money he's not paying, so he's trying to recover it. \n\nBut there's an element of taking matters into his own hands. Maybe the author should have discussed this with the group or involved a mediator instead of unilaterally blocking access. Also, the fact that Sam is in a tough time (like his breakup and rugby team) might affect his ability to pay, but the author points out he spends money on weed daily, which contradicts his claims of financial trouble.\n\nThe author did give warnings, but when Sam didn't comply, he took action. However, cutting off internet access might be seen as a harsh measure, especially if it affects Sam's studies. But since the author set up the broadband and is covering the costs, he might feel it's within his rights to manage access based on payments.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions that the broadband was upgraded due to Sam's request, which cost more. So Sam's initial push for a better plan ties into his responsibility to pay for it. The author isn't just asking for his share; Sam's choice influenced the cost. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong.\n\nBut the issue is whether blocking the internet is a fair response. If the agreement was clear, and Sam isn't fulfilling his part, the author has a right to enforce it. However, doing so in a way that affects Sam's academic work could be problematic. But the author suggests that Sam could use campus libraries, which might be a valid alternative. The fact that Sam is in a situation where he can't pay despite having other expenses (like weed) could indicate that he's choosing not to prioritize payments.\n\nSo balancing these factors, the author might not be in the wrong. He followed up, gave warnings, and took action when necessary. However, the method of blocking internet could be seen as harsh. But considering the circumstances, maybe it's justified. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
