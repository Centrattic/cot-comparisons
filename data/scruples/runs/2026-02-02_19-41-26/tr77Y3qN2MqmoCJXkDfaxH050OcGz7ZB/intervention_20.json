When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who blocked their housemate from the internet is in the wrong. The situation is that Sam hasn't paid his share of the broadband for three months, and the author blocked his devices. \n\nFirst, the key points: They agreed everyone would pay their share each month. Sam didn't set up a standing order and kept delaying payments. The author paid for half the broadband, which is adding up. They confronted Sam, who promised to pay when his girlfriend leaves, but then the author blocked him. Sam got angry, damaged his wall, and now he's saying he needs the internet for coursework.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning was that Sam owes money and wasn't paying, so blocking access is a way to enforce payment. But the question is whether this was justified. On one hand, the author might feel they're being taken advantage of and are trying to ensure they're not covering the costs alone. On the other hand, blocking internet access could hinder Sam's academic work, which is important. Also, the author is using a method that's not agreed upon\u2014there was no prior agreement that non-payment would result in internet restrictions. \n\nSam's behavior of ignoring messages and not paying is definitely wrong, but the author's response might be seen as heavy-handed. The author could have taken other steps first, like involving the group to mediate, or maybe deducting from his deposit if that's an option. Instead, they took unilateral action, which might affect Sam's studies and caused a conflict. Plus, Sam's reaction (damaging the wall) is a consequence the author might not have anticipated, but they still chose to proceed with the block despite knowing Sam needed it for coursework.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is still paying half now (since they split it four ways but Sam hasn't paid) means they're out of pocket. But the method of enforcement here could be problematic. Legally, in a shared tenancy, each person is responsible for their own payments, but the author isn't the landlord. Blocking internet access isn't a legal or contractual right unless specified. So, while the author has a right to be paid, the method of enforcement through personal action (blocking) might not be justified, especially when it affects Sam's studies. \n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the action taken was more about asserting control rather than a fair resolution. There's a lack of prior agreement on consequences, and the action directly impacts Sam's academic work without a clear, agreed-upon method. The author's intent was to enforce payment, but the method used could be seen as harsh and possibly unfair, especially when there are other ways to handle the debt without hindering someone's education.\n"
