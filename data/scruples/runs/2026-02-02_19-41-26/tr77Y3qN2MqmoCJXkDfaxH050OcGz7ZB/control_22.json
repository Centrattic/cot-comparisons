When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months.\n\nFirst, the setup: They all agreed that each would pay their share at the beginning of the month. Others set up standing orders, but Sam didn't. The author was lenient initially, but now Sam hasn't paid for three months. The author blocked Sam's devices after confronting him, leading to Sam's reaction of punching a wall and now claiming he needs internet for coursework.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Agreed upon payment terms, Sam's non-payment, the author's action of blocking internet, and the consequences.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author has a right to expect payment as per the agreement. Not paying is a breach of that agreement. The author is covering Sam's share, which could be a financial burden. Blocking internet is a way to enforce payment, which might be harsh but could be seen as a last resort after previous attempts to get payment failed.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here: Sam now claims he needs the internet for coursework. If the author blocked it, even though he hasn't paid, but this affects Sam's academic work, does that make the author wrong? But the author also mentioned that Sam smokes weed daily, implying he might not be as responsible as he claims. Also, the author suggested using campus libraries, which Sam refused.\n\nLegally, if they're roommates without a formal agreement, the author might not have a legal right to block internet. But morally, it's about mutual agreements and accountability. The author tried to be understanding initially, but after repeated non-payment and ignoring requests, taking action is a way to enforce fairness. The fact that Sam used to be in a tough spot but still didn't pay could indicate a pattern of not following through.\n\nOn the other hand, blocking internet could be seen as cutting off someone's resources when they need it, especially for schoolwork. However, the author isn't preventing Sam from studying entirely\u2014libraries are an option. It's a conflict between personal responsibility and immediate needs.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a response to a broken agreement. While the method might be harsh, the underlying issue is about respecting shared responsibilities. The author isn't in the wrong for enforcing the agreement they had, especially after multiple attempts to resolve it amicably.\n"
