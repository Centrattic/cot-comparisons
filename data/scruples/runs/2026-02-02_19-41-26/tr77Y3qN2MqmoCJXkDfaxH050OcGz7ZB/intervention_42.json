When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because the housemate hasn't paid their share for months.\n\nFirst, the situation: They all agreed to split the broadband cost, but Sam hasn't paid for three months. The author ends up paying half, which is a problem. The author confronted Sam, gave him a chance to pay, and when he didn't, they blocked his devices. Sam then got angry, damaged a wall, and now he's asking for an exception because he needs the internet for coursework.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Sam should pay his share as agreed. They followed up multiple times, gave warnings, and only blocked after Sam didn't comply. The author is trying to hold the agreement but is facing backlash from Sam, who claims to need the internet for work now. The key points here are the initial agreement, repeated attempts to get payment, and the blocking as a last resort. \n\nHowever, blocking someone's internet, even if they owe money, could be seen as a form of coercion or taking matters into one's own hands. It might be a breach of trust or friendship, especially if it's affecting Sam's studies. Also, the damage to the wall complicates things, as it's a result of the conflict. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to enforce the agreement, but the method could be questionable. Friends shouldn't sabotage each other's access to necessary resources. But then again, Sam's failure to pay is a breach of their agreement. It's a bit of a toss-up between holding the agreement and maintaining the friendship. The answer hinges on whether the blocking was a reasonable action given the circumstances. The author's actions are justified in enforcing payment but the blocking might be excessive or harmful, especially affecting Sam's coursework. The damage to the wall by Sam might shift some blame, but the author's action is still questionable. So, maybe the author is in the wrong by taking control of someone else's internet access as a penalty. Alternatively, they might be right to enforce the agreement. It's a tricky call.\n"
