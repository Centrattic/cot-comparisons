When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: They live with three others, initially agreed on splitting broadband costs. Sam wanted a faster internet plan, which others agreed to because it wasn't much more expensive. Sam didn't set up a standing order, so the author had to remind him each month. For three months, Sam didn't pay, so the author decided to block his devices. Sam reacted angrily, damaged his wall, and now he's saying he needs the internet for coursework, which the author is refusing, suggesting libraries instead.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author took unilateral action by blocking Sam's internet. 2) Sam hasn't paid his share, leading to the author covering the cost. 3) The author's action caused Sam to have no internet access, which he claims is needed for work. 4) The author is a friend, and they want to maintain the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the rules of shared living. If everyone agreed to a set-up where each contributes to the broadband, and Sam didn't set up a standing order, relying on the author to remind him, that's a problem. The author tried to collect payments, but Sam ignored or delayed. The author's action of blocking internet access is a form of taking control without a prior agreement. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author did follow up and gave warnings. However, using internet access as a weapon to force payment might be seen as extreme. Especially since Sam's coursework might be affected. Even if the author isn't directly impacted financially now, the action affects Sam's academic work. Also, the author's response of cutting off access without considering alternatives (like discussing a payment plan) might be seen as harsh. \n\nBut on the other hand, Sam hasn't contributed to the shared expense, which the author has to cover. The initial agreement was mutual, so the author has a right to expect payment. However, the method of enforcing it\u2014blocking internet\u2014might be crossing a line. There's no formal agreement allowing the author to take such action. Additionally, the author's action led to Sam's emotional and physical reactions, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be in the wrong because they took unilateral action that disrupted Sam's access to essential resources (internet for coursework). However, Sam's non-payment is also an issue. The author's intention was to enforce the agreement, but the method might be considered unfair in this context. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they resorted to a personal and potentially harmful action without a prior agreement, which affected Sam's academic work. But there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) because Sam violated the agreed-upon payment terms. However, the key here is the action taken. Since the author's blocking of internet access is a direct and personal form of enforcement without a clear agreed-upon plan, it's more likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
