When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who blocked their housemate's internet access is in the wrong. The situation is that the housemate, Sam, hasn't paid his share for three months, and the author blocked his devices. The author is concerned about being in the wrong because Sam now has an assignment needing internet.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the facts. They agreed that everyone would pay their share each month. Most paid via standing order, but Sam didn't. The author asked repeatedly, and Sam ignored or delayed. The author then blocked Sam's devices after he hadn't paid, leading to Sam breaking a wall. Now Sam is asking for internet access for his coursework, but the author refuses.\n\nSo, was blocking the internet justified? Legally, the author isn't the service provider, so interfering with access might be a gray area. But in a shared living situation, there's an expectation of contributing to shared costs. However, blocking internet access is a form of penalty that affects Sam's ability to study, especially if it's required for his coursework. The author's action might be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of addressing the payment issue through other means, like mediation or formal agreements.\n\nThe author's main issue is being taken advantage of, but their response escalated the situation. Sam's behavior of ignoring payments and then reacting negatively by damaging property is problematic. The author's action of blocking internet could be seen as a form of financial coercion, which might not be fair, especially if it's affecting Sam's studies. However, the author is also trying to enforce a prior agreement.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author has a right to expect payment. But using a method that disrupts Sam's academic work might be excessive, especially if there's a possibility of resolving the payment issue without cutting off essential services. The author could have offered alternatives, like a temporary payment plan, instead of immediate blocking.\n\nSo, the author's action is a bit of both. They have a valid grievance with unpaid bills, but the method of enforcement is questionable. The answer would balance these points. Since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but there's a valid side to both, it's a bit tricky. However, the key point is whether the blocking was justified. If the author had a prior agreement to pay and Sam is now in a situation where he needs the internet for school, blocking it could be seen as going too far. So, the answer might lean towards AITA being the author, but the user's initial thought was they are in the wrong. Wait, the user's question is \"is the author in the wrong?\" So the user thinks yes, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n\nConsidering the options: Answering A (author is in the wrong) or B (not). The author's action is a form of financial penalty that affects Sam's studies. Even if Sam is at fault for not paying, the author's method of enforcement might be excessive. So, the author is partially at fault for not handling it more diplomatically. But Sam is also at fault. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author took unilateral action without considering the consequences on Sam's studies, they might be in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
