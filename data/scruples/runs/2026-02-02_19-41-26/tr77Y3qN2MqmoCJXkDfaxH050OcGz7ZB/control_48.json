When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their housemates split the broadband costs. Initially, they agreed to pay monthly, but Sam hasn't paid for three months. The author ended up paying half themselves and decided to block Sam's devices until he pays. The conflict escalated, leading to Sam damaging his wall.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the agreement was mutual, Sam didn't pay as agreed, the author tried to communicate multiple times, and then took action by blocking the internet. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nLegally, if they had a verbal agreement, the author might have the right to enforce payment. However, blocking someone's internet could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. But since they're all adults sharing expenses, the author might feel justified. On the other hand, cutting off internet access could interfere with Sam's schoolwork, which complicates things. The author also mentions that Sam is working on coursework now, which might be a valid reason to reconsider the block.\n\nEthically, the author is being fair by enforcing the agreement they had. But using the internet block as a punishment might not be the best approach if it affects Sam's studies. The author is also not being paid back, so they're out of pocket. However, the method of enforcement could be seen as harsh, especially if it's impacting Sam's academic responsibilities.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship aspect. The author values the friendship but feels taken advantage of. Blocking internet might strain the relationship further. But the author also took the initiative to communicate first, which is a reasonable step.\n\nI need to consider if there were other options. The author could have involved a mediator or the landlord, but since it's their own setup, maybe not. Blocking devices is a direct approach but could be seen as excessive if it's causing harm beyond just financial. The fact that Sam is now asking for libraries might indicate that the author's solution is practical, but it's not ideal for him.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action is a response to a broken agreement, and they might feel justified. However, the method of enforcement might be problematic if it's hindering Sam's work. But since the agreement was mutual, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer leans towards B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances. The key is that the author tried to communicate and took action as per their agreement, even if the consequences were unintended.\n"
