When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is questioning whether they were in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months. They had agreed that everyone would pay their portion each month, and the others set up standing orders, but Sam didn't. The author ended up covering Sam's share, and after multiple reminders, Sam didn't pay. The author then blocked his devices, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, consider the agreement. They had a mutual agreement where everyone was supposed to pay their share. Sam's failure to pay is a breach of that agreement. The author is trying to enforce their part of the deal, which is understandable. Blocking internet access could be seen as a form of leverage to get Sam to fulfill his financial responsibility.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author mentions that Sam has an important coursework needing internet, but the author suggested using the library. But Sam didn't pay, so the author's action might prioritize their own financial standing over Sam's academic needs. But since the author is also a student, maybe they understand the importance. However, the financial responsibility is on the housemates to cover their own share.\n\nAnother point is that the author is paying half of the broadband because Sam hasn't paid. That's a significant financial burden, and the author is trying to recoup that by blocking access. But is it fair to cut off internet access, especially when others might still be using it? The author's action affects Sam's ability to study, but the author argues it's Sam's own fault for not paying.\n\nThe author also mentions that Sam is smoking weed every day, which might indicate he has disposable income but isn't using it to pay his share. That could be seen as taking advantage of the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, blocking someone's internet could be considered a harsh measure. It's a form of punishment that affects Sam's studies and personal life. The author might have handled it differently, like involving a mediator or seeking a more collaborative solution. But given the repeated non-payment and the lack of response, the author might feel justified in taking action to protect their own finances.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has a right to seek payment for the service, but the method of enforcement (blocking internet) could be seen as unfair, especially if it's affecting Sam's academic work. The key is whether the author's actions were proportionate to the issue. Since the agreement was about paying their share, and the author is enforcing that, maybe it's not entirely wrong. But considering the impact on Sam's studies and the potential for a better resolution, there's a case to say the author overstepped.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author is enforcing a prior agreement, and the blocking is a way to ensure payment. However, there's a valid argument for A (in the wrong) due to the punitive measure affecting studies. But given the context of repeated non-payment and the author's financial burden, the answer is more B.\n"
