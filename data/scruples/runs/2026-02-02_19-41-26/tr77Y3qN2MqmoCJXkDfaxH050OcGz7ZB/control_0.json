When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who blocked their housemate's internet access is in the wrong. The situation involves unpaid bills and a conflict over internet usage.\n\nFirst, the main points: The roommate, Sam, hasn't paid his share for three months. The author set up a system where everyone pays their share at the start of the month. Sam didn't use a standing order, leading to repeated delays or non-payment. The author blocked Sam's devices after he didn't pay, even though Sam mentioned needing internet for coursework. Sam responded negatively, causing some property damage and escalating the conflict.\n\nNow, considering the financial aspect. The author is covering Sam's share, which adds up over three months. Legally, if they're roommates sharing costs, each is responsible for their portion. However, enforcing payment can be tricky. Blocking internet access is a form of taking matters into one's own hands. The author's action might be seen as taking a stand to recover owed money, but it also affects Sam's ability to work, especially if he needs the internet for coursework. The author argues it's not impacting them financially now, but the principle is about fairness.\n\nEthically, the author's intent was to enforce payment terms agreed upon. However, cutting off internet access might be harsh, especially if it hinders Sam's studies. The author's response was immediate and possibly without considering alternative solutions, like using campus libraries. The fact that Sam was smoking weed and not working on coursework might indicate he's not as diligent as he claims, but the author's action could be seen as unfair if it directly affects his academic work.\n\nAlso, the method of blocking internet access could be a violation of the roommate's rights. It's a form of coercion, which might not be the best approach. The author might have a valid grievance about unpaid bills but could have handled it differently, like involving all housemates or seeking mediation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a legitimate complaint about unpaid bills, blocking internet access is a harsh measure that affects Sam's studies and may not be the best way to resolve the issue. The author is taking a strict stand but could be in the wrong for using this method instead of other avenues to recover the money.\n"
