When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: four housemates sharing broadband. Agreed that each pays a quarter monthly. Sam hasn't paid for three months, leading the author to block his devices. The author mentions that Sam initially wanted faster internet, which they all agreed to, but now isn't contributing. The author is covering half the cost, which is adding up. Confrontation leads to blocking, and Sam reacts by damaging a wall. Now Sam is asking for internet access to do coursework, but the author is firm.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual agreement on payment terms, Sam's non-payment, and the author's action of blocking devices. Legally, can the author do that? Maybe not, because they're not the service provider. But in shared living arrangements, people often make their own rules. However, cutting off someone's internet, especially if it's needed for coursework, might be seen as harsh. Also, Sam's reaction\u2014damaging property\u2014could affect how others view the situation.\n\nMoral side: the author is standing up for their right to be paid, but maybe the method is extreme. The author is in a position where they're already paying more, so they feel justified. However, blocking internet access might disrupt Sam's studies, which could impact his academic performance. The author is also trying to maintain friendship but is frustrated with being taken advantage of.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Sam is going through a tough time, but he does have some spending habits (smoking weed daily). The author might be right to enforce payment, but the blocking could be a breach of trust or a violation of shared resources. If the broadband was set up collectively, maybe the author isn't the sole decider of access. Also, the damage to the wall might shift sympathy towards the author, as Sam's actions could lead to additional costs for everyone.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's action is a form of punishment, which might not be the best approach. Maybe a better solution would be to involve the landlord or find another way to enforce payment. But in the absence of a formal agreement, the author might feel they have no choice. The author's priority is their own financial responsibility, which is understandable, but the method could be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, they're enforcing a shared agreement, but on the other, they're causing a disruption that affects Sam's work. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances of their agreement and local laws. However, since they're in a university house, perhaps there are institutional policies that could be followed. The author's actions, while understandable, might be seen as overly harsh, especially if it's impacting Sam's studies without a formal agreement in place. So, probably the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because cutting off internet access is a drastic measure that might not be fair, even if Sam hasn't paid. Alternatively, if the agreement was clear that non-payment leads to loss of access, then B. But the question is whether they're in the wrong, so maybe A because it's not a proportionate response.\n"
