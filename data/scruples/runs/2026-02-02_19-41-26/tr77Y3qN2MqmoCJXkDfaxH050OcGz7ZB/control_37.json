When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who blocked their housemate's internet access is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the setup: four housemates split the broadband cost. Sam hasn't paid his share for three months. Initially, they agreed to basic internet, but Sam wanted faster, which they all agreed to because the cost difference was minimal. Sam didn't set up a standing order, so the others had to remind him. For the first few months, he paid when asked, but now he's been ignoring messages and delaying payments. The author is paying half the bill alone, which is adding up. They confronted Sam and blocked his devices when he didn't pay, leading to Sam's tantrum and some damage. Now Sam is asking for internet access for coursework, but the author is reluctant.\n\nSo, the key points here are: financial responsibility, agreed-upon terms, and the method of enforcing those terms. The author's action was to block internet as a consequence for not paying. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nFinancially, if Sam hasn't paid his share, the others are covering his part, which is unfair. The author tried to communicate and give warnings. The problem arises when Sam ignores repeated requests. Blocking access could be seen as a way to enforce payment, but it also affects Sam's ability to work on his coursework. However, Sam's behavior of not paying despite being able to (e.g., smoking weed daily) suggests he's choosing to prioritize other expenses over his share. The author's action might be seen as enforcing the original agreement, but it's a bit of a power move. However, since it's a shared responsibility and Sam is breaching the agreement, the author isn't entirely wrong. On the other hand, cutting off internet might hinder Sam's academic work, which could be a valid concern. But the author tried to suggest alternatives like using the library. The friendship aspect is also a factor\u2014maintaining it while asserting boundaries is tricky. The author's main issue is feeling taken advantage of, which is a common problem in shared living. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking action to enforce the agreement they had. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
