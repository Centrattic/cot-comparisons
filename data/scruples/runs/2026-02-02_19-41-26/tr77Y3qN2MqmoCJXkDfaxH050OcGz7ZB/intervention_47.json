When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who asked the question (the author) is in the wrong for blocking their housemate Sam's devices from the broadband because Sam hasn't paid his share for three months. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and three others share a house. They all agreed to split the broadband cost. Sam initially wanted faster internet, which the others agreed to because the extra cost was manageable. Sam didn't set up a standing order and stopped paying for three months. The author is covering Sam's share, so they're paying double. They confronted Sam, who said he'd pay when his girlfriend leaves, but then didn't. The author blocked Sam's devices, leading to Sam damaging his wall and now needing internet for coursework.\n\nThe key points here are the agreement about payments, the breach of that agreement, and the action taken (blocking access). The author's reasoning is that Sam's non-payment is unfair, and they're trying to enforce the agreement. However, blocking internet access could affect Sam's work, even if the author isn't directly impacted financially now.\n\nLegally, I'm not sure if blocking someone's internet access is permissible. It's a service they've collectively paid for, so the author might not have the right to restrict others' access unilaterally. Ethically, while the author has a valid point about being taken advantage of, the method of enforcement could be harsh, especially if it's affecting Sam's academic work.\n\nThe author mentions that Sam's coursework requires internet, and they suggested using the library. But Sam might not work well in libraries. The author's action might be seen as punitive beyond just collecting the debt. Also, the author is taking it personally, which adds emotional tension. \n\nIn such situations, communication and perhaps involving a neutral party or landlord could be better approaches. Blocking access might be seen as an overreaction, even if the debt exists. The author's intention is justified, but the method might be questionable. So, considering both the ethical and practical aspects, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their action could be seen as excessive and potentially harmful to Sam's studies, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n"
