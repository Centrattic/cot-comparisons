When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for blocking a housemate's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: four housemates sharing broadband. Originally, they agreed to split the bill. Sam initially wanted faster internet, which they all agreed to because the cost difference was minimal when split. He didn't set up a standing order, but in the past, he'd pay when asked. Now, he's been ignoring requests for three months, so the author is covering his share. The author confronts Sam, warns him, and then blocks his devices when he doesn't pay. Sam reacts by punching a wall, causing damage, and then claims he can't finish his coursework without internet.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to enforce a shared agreement. If everyone agreed to split the costs, then not paying is a breach of that agreement. The author is out of pocket, so blocking Sam's internet could be seen as a way to enforce payment. The author did warn Sam first, which is fair. Also, Sam's behavior of ignoring payment and then acting out might be his own fault. The author isn't causing the problem; they're responding to Sam's non-payment.\n\nOn the other hand, blocking internet could hinder Sam's academic work, even if he's not paying. The author mentions Sam has an important piece of coursework now. Even if the author believes they're within their rights, taking away internet might affect the coursework. But then again, Sam didn't pay his share, so maybe he should have anticipated this. Also, the author is covering half the cost, which is significant. The author might feel taken advantage of. Sam's reaction of punching a wall is his own responsibility, not the author's.\n\nAnother angle: the author's method of blocking devices. They used their own setup to enforce payment. But is that a reasonable response? Maybe there's a better way, like involving the landlord or a mediator. However, the author tried communication first, then followed through with action. It's a bit of a strong measure, but if the agreement was clear, the author could argue they're just upholding their end.\n\nAlso, Sam's current situation\u2014smoking weed daily and claiming money issues\u2014might indicate poor budgeting. The author isn't the one causing Sam's financial problems. The author's actions, while maybe harsh, are a response to Sam's non-payment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They tried to resolve it amicably, gave warnings, and only took action after Sam failed to comply. The author's main issue is being taken advantage of, and they're trying to enforce the shared agreement. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance here. Did the author have the right to block the internet? If the broadband is in the author's name, they might have control over it. If it's a shared account, then maybe not. But in this case, the author set it up, so they might have the authority. Also, Sam's coursework issue is his own responsibility for not paying on time. The author is not responsible for his coursework problems. So, I think B is the right answer here.\n"
