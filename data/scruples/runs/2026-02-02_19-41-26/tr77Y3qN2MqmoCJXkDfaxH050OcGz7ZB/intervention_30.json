When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who blocked their roommate's internet is in the wrong. The situation is that they all agreed to split the broadband costs, but one roommate, Sam, hasn't paid for three months. The author blocked his devices to get him to pay up. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of their agreement. They agreed that everyone would pay their share each month. Sam didn't set up a standing order and hasn't been paying on time. The author has been reminding him, but he's been ignoring messages or saying he'll pay later. \n\nThe author decided to block Sam's devices after three months of non-payment. Sam then reacts badly, gets angry, and even damages the wall. Now, he's saying he needs internet for coursework and can't pay yet, but the author isn't budging and even suggests using the library.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to enforce a shared agreement and isn't being unreasonable by asking for payment. They tried communication before taking action. Blocking internet access could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the best approach, especially if it's affecting Sam's coursework. But on the other hand, Sam hasn't upheld his part of the agreement, so the author might feel justified in enforcing it.\n\nI need to weigh the consequences. Blocking internet is a significant action that affects Sam's ability to work. However, the author is also out of pocket for the bills. Is there a better way to handle this? Maybe going through the landlord or a more formal process, but in a university setting, roommates often make their own arrangements. \n\nThe author's main issue is being taken advantage of, but their method of enforcement might be harsh. The fact that Sam is using the internet for gaming despite claiming it's for studying adds another layer. The author's actions might be seen as fair given the agreement, but the timing of blocking during important coursework could be problematic. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they tried to communicate and had a prior agreement. However, blocking internet could be seen as a strict measure. But considering the agreement and Sam's non-payment, maybe the author is justified. Alternatively, the author could be in the wrong for cutting off access without a more formal process or considering Sam's needs.\n"
