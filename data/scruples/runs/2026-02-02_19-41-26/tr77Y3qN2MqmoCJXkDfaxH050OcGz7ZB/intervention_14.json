When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who blocked their housemate's internet is in the wrong. So, the situation is that Sam hasn't paid his share for three months, and the author decided to block his devices. The group agreed to split the cost, and the author is covering half now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if blocking internet access is a reasonable action. They had an agreement where everyone was supposed to pay at the start of each month. Sam didn't set up a standing order, but he used to pay when asked. Now he's not paying, so the author is taking matters into their own hands by blocking the internet. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to enforce a mutual agreement. They might feel justified because Sam isn't fulfilling his part, and they're covering the costs. However, blocking internet access could disrupt Sam's studies, especially if he needs it for coursework. The author mentions that Sam said he needs internet for an important piece of work now, which complicates things. Also, the author is using the blocking as a threat, which might be considered a form of coercion.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship. The author still considers Sam a friend but feels taken advantage of. The response from Sam seems to be acting out, like punching a wall, which is a result of the author's action. This could be seen as the author's actions escalating the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nLegally, the author isn't the one who set up the broadband contract. If the bill is in the author's name, they have the authority to manage the internet access. But ethically, using a service disruption as leverage for payment might be questionable. Also, the author is using the blocking as punishment, which might not be the most constructive way to handle debt. \n\nMoreover, the author's actions might have caused property damage (the hole in the wall) and potential injuries. While that's on Sam, the author might have foreseen that blocking internet could lead to such reactions. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action could be seen as a breach of trust or friendship. Instead of blocking internet, maybe they should have talked to Sam about his payment issues, suggested temporary payment plans, or involved a mediator. Blocking internet access without prior communication might be seen as harsh and could harm the friendship more than necessary. \n\nSo, even though Sam isn't paying, the method the author used to enforce payment might be considered wrong, especially since it affects Sam's studies and the friendship. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they took unilateral action without considering alternatives that preserve the relationship.\n"
