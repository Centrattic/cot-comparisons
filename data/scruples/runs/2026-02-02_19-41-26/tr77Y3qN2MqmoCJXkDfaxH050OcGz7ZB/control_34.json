When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who blocked their housemate's internet access is in the wrong. The situation involves unpaid bills and a conflict over shared resources.\n\nFirst, the setup: four housemates share broadband. They agreed each would pay their share monthly. Sam hasn't paid for three months, and the author ended up paying their share. The author blocked Sam's devices to get him to pay. Now Sam claims he needs the internet for coursework, but also smokes weed daily, and there's some conflict about the blocking causing damage and tension.\n\nThe key points here are the agreement, the enforcement of that agreement, and the proportionality of the actions taken. The housemates had a verbal agreement where everyone would pay monthly. Sam didn't set up a standing order, which others did. The author gave reminders but Sam ignored them. Blocking internet access is a way to enforce payment. \n\nHowever, there's a question about the fairness and the impact on Sam's work. The author mentions Sam has coursework needing internet, but Sam's actions (smoking weed daily) might be seen as contributing to his financial issues. The author also points out that the financial burden is on them, but the question is whether blocking internet is a valid way to enforce payment.\n\nLegally, if there's a shared agreement, all parties are responsible for their part. If the internet is a shared resource, withholding it from one person might be problematic because others might still need it. But since the author is paying for the entire cost because of Sam's non-payment, blocking his access could be a way to enforce accountability.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between enforcing responsibility and being fair. The author's action was to block Sam's devices specifically, not cut off everyone. That could be seen as a targeted approach. However, if Sam's coursework is important, the author's action might hinder his work, but Sam's non-payment is a breach of the agreed terms. The author's frustration is justified, but using internet as leverage might not be the best method, especially if it affects academic work.\n\nThe other housemates might be affected indirectly, but the main issue is between the author and Sam. The author's approach could be seen as taking control but also as being harsh. The fact that Sam laughed at the situation and made fun of the author adds to the tension, but doesn't negate the original agreement.\n\nIn summary, the author is enforcing a shared agreement, but the method might be seen as extreme if it's impacting Sam's necessary work. However, since the author is covering the cost and Sam isn't contributing, the action could be justified as self-preservation. The answer depends on whether enforcing payment through internet access is considered a fair approach in this context.\n"
