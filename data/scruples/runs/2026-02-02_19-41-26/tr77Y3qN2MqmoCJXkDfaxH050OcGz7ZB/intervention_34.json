When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months.\n\nFirst, looking at the agreement: They had a verbal agreement that everyone would pay their share at the beginning of each month. The author and others set up a standing order, but Sam didn't. The author initially didn't mind since Sam would pay when reminded, but now he's been ignoring messages for three months. The author is covering half the cost, which is adding up.\n\nThe author confronted Sam and gave him a deadline to pay or be blocked. When Sam didn't pay, the author blocked his devices. Sam then had a tantrum, damaged the wall, and now claims he needs the internet for coursework. The author is now second-guessing because Sam's work might be affected, even though financially, the author isn't being impacted currently.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the landlord or internet provider would typically handle such issues, but in a shared setup, it's more about the agreement between roommates. The author's action of blocking internet access is a form of taking matters into their own hands. While Sam's behavior of not paying his share is clearly wrong, retaliating by cutting off a necessary service like internet could be seen as harsh, especially if it affects Sam's academic work. However, the author did give a warning before blocking. The author's main issue is feeling taken advantage of, which is understandable. But the method of enforcement might be problematic because it's not a standard practice and could escalate tensions. Sam's response (tantrum, damaging property) is also his fault, but the author needs to consider the consequences of their actions. There's a balance between holding others accountable and maintaining a healthy living environment. The author might have a valid point about fairness, but the execution could be questioned, especially if it's affecting someone's studies. So, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer could go either way, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong since they gave a warning, but the blocking might be too extreme given the circumstances.\n"
