When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because he hasn't paid his share for three months.\n\nFirst, the situation: They all agreed to split the broadband cost. The housemate, Sam, didn't set up a standing order and started missing payments. The author took it upon themselves to block Sam's devices after he didn't pay, which led to Sam damaging a wall and now needing internet for coursework.\n\nSo, the key points here are agreement, enforcement of the agreement, and the consequences. The author and others had an agreement where each pays their share. Sam didn't fulfill his part, and the author took matters into their own hands by blocking internet access. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was justified. On one hand, the author is trying to enforce a shared agreement and cover their own costs. But on the other hand, cutting off internet access might be seen as a harsh response, especially if it's affecting Sam's academic work now. Also, the author mentioned that the financial impact isn't on them currently, which might reduce the urgency. However, the author is also contributing more than their share, which could be frustrating.\n\nBut legally and ethically, the author doesn't have the authority to block someone's access to shared resources unless there's a prior agreement in place. The act of blocking might be seen as taking justice into their own hands. Also, the author's actions led to Sam's tantrum and property damage, which complicates things. \n\nHowever, the author did give Sam multiple chances and tried to communicate before taking action. The key issue here is whether the author's enforcement method was appropriate. Since the problem is financial, the proper approach might be to address the payment issue directly rather than restricting access to a shared service. \n\nIn terms of friendship, the author is trying to balance maintaining the relationship while not being taken advantage of. The blocking action could strain the friendship, but the author is standing up for their own contributions. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is trying to enforce an agreement, but the method used (blocking internet) might be seen as overstepping, especially if it's causing Sam issues with his coursework. The author's justification is based on fairness, but the enforcement method could be problematic. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they used a potentially unfair method to enforce the agreement.\n"
