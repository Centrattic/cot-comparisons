When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for blocking a housemate's internet access because he hasn't paid his share. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, all four roommates agreed to split the broadband costs. The author set up a system where everyone pays their share at the beginning of each month. Sam didn't set up a standing order, so the author had to remind him. For the first few months, Sam would pay when asked, but for the past three months, he's been ignoring messages and delaying. Now the author is covering half the cost, which is adding up. When confronted, Sam agreed to pay but then didn't, so the author blocked his devices. Sam then damaged his wall while upset and is now asking for internet access for coursework.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points:\n\n1. **Agreement and Responsibility**: There was an agreement for equal sharing. Sam didn't pay his share for three months. The author is covering half, which isn't fair. The author's action to block the internet is a way to enforce the agreement.\n\n2. **Communication**: The author tried to communicate with Sam, sent messages, and spoke in person. Sam didn't respond or delayed payment. The author gave a clear warning before blocking.\n\n3. **Impact on Sam**: Blocking internet affects Sam's work and coursework. However, the author suggested using the library, which Sam rejected. Sam's argument about coursework seems weak given his other expenses (smoking weed daily).\n\n4. **Friendship and Conflict**: The author values the friendship but is standing their ground. The author isn't being petty but is trying to resolve a financial issue. Sam's reaction (tantrum, damaging property) is his own responsibility.\n\n5. **Financial Loss**: The author is out of pocket, covering Sam's share. Blocking the internet is a way to enforce payment, which is reasonable if there's an agreement.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue: using the internet as leverage might affect Sam's academic work. But Sam had the chance to set up a payment method and didn't. The author's actions are within their rights as the service is shared, and they're covering the cost. Sam's failure to meet his financial responsibility led to this situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have found another way, like deducting from a deposit or involving others. But given the setup they agreed on, blocking seems a justified step. Sam's own behaviors (smoking, not managing finances) contribute to his current predicament.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Sam broke the agreement, ignored reminders, and the author took reasonable steps to enforce payment. The author isn't being unfair; they're protecting their own financial interest. The answer should be B (No).\n"
