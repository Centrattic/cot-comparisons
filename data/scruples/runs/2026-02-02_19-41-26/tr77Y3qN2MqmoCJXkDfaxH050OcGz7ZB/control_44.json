When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who blocked their housemate's internet is in the wrong. Let me start by summarizing the situation.\n\nSo, there are four housemates, and they split the broadband cost. Sam didn't pay his share for three months. The others were okay with the faster internet because he needed it for his studies, even though he plays games. The narrator set up a system where everyone pays at the start of the month. The others used standing orders, but Sam didn't, and for the first few months, he paid when reminded. But recently, he's been ignoring messages or saying he'll pay later. The narrator confronted him, and when he didn't pay, they blocked his devices. Sam then had a tantrum, punched a wall, and now he's saying he needs the internet for coursework and can't pay yet. The question is whether the narrator is at fault.\n\nFirst, the narrator's action: blocking Sam's devices because he hasn't paid. Legally, I'm not sure, but in a shared living situation, you usually need to follow the agreed-upon terms. The group agreed that everyone would pay their share each month. Sam wasn't paying, so the narrator is covering his share. Blocking access could be seen as a form of taking control, but maybe not illegal. However, it's a bit of a conflict of interest because the narrator is enforcing the rules they set up.\n\nBut the problem is that when the narrator blocked the internet, Sam needed it for coursework. The narrator's reasoning was that Sam should pay, but by blocking access, they might be hindering his studies. However, the narrator also suggested using campus libraries, which Sam rejected. The narrator might feel they're not at fault because the agreement was that everyone pays their share. But maybe the narrator should have found another way to handle the debt first, like going to a mediator or discussing with the other housemates before blocking internet access.\n\nOn the other hand, Sam isn't paying as agreed, which is unfair. The narrator is trying to enforce the agreement, but the timing of blocking during important coursework might be problematic. It's a bit of a gray area. The narrator might have overstepped by unilaterally blocking access without perhaps consulting the others or giving Sam more time. But they did warn him before blocking. Also, Sam's reaction (punching a wall) is his responsibility, not the narrator's.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether enforcing the payment agreement justifies blocking internet access, especially when it affects Sam's academic work. The narrator's action is enforcing a rule they all agreed to, but maybe they should have handled it differently. However, the user is asking if the narrator is in the wrong. If the agreement was clear and the narrator followed the steps (confronting Sam, giving warnings), then maybe not. However, the immediate blocking despite Sam's current academic needs could be seen as harsh. But if the agreement is that you pay your share, then not paying leads to consequences. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're upholding the agreement, but some might argue it's a bit heavy-handed. Alternatively, maybe A because it's affecting his studies. But the user's question is whether they're in the wrong, and the answer depends on context. Given the situation, I think the narrator is not in the wrong because they're enforcing the agreed-upon terms, even if it's a bit strict.\n"
