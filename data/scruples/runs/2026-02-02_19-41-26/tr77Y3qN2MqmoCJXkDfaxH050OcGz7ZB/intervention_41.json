When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author lives with three other housemates, including Sam. They agreed to split the broadband cost each month. Sam hasn't paid for three months, so the author blocked his devices. Sam now needs the internet for coursework but can't access it because he's been blocked. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong by doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement they had. The original plan was that everyone pays their share each month. Sam didn't set up a standing order and kept delaying payments. The author took it upon themselves to block Sam's devices after he didn't pay. The author's argument is that they're just enforcing the agreement, but Sam now has a coursework deadline.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be paid for the shared expense. They set up the internet, and others split the cost. Sam's non-payment is a breach of their agreement. Blocking access could be seen as a way to enforce payment. However, the author's action might have consequences for Sam's academic work, which could be considered unfair if it affects his studies.\n\nBut Sam also didn't pay and is now using his coursework as an excuse. He was using the internet for gaming, which he tried to hide. The author might feel taken advantage of. The fact that Sam ignored previous messages and acted dismissive might justify the author taking action. However, blocking internet access could be seen as harsh, especially if it impacts Sam's studies. The author's main issue is financial, not that they were using the internet for other purposes. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that Sam smokes weed every day, which might imply he has other financial responsibilities he's not disclosing. The author's action could be seen as necessary to get paid what they're owed. However, the method of blocking might not be the best approach. Maybe a more collaborative approach, like discussing with all housemates or adjusting the payment method, would be better.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the author values maintaining the relationship but feels taken advantage of. Blocking someone from internet access is a strong measure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for that action. If the agreement was clear and the author is just enforcing it, maybe not. But if the action causes undue harm to Sam's studies, perhaps they are.\n\nI think the key points are the existence of a prior agreement, the enforcement method, and the impact on Sam's studies. The author is in a position where they need to be paid, but the blocking might be excessive. However, considering Sam's non-payment over three months and the prior communication, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a better way to resolve it without affecting studies. Since Sam is now in a bind, the author could offer a compromise, but the question is about being in the wrong. So the author's action was to enforce payment, which is reasonable, but the timing might be problematic. However, given the circumstances, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
