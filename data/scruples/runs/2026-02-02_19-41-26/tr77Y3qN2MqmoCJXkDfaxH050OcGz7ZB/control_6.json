When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is at fault for blocking their housemate Sam's internet access because he hasn't paid his share of the broadband.\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. They live together, and an agreement was made that each person would pay their share at the beginning of the month. The other housemates set up standing orders, but Sam didn't. He kept saying he'd pay later but didn't. The author ended up paying for half the bill themselves, which added up over three months. When confronted, the author blocked Sam's devices until he paid. Sam reacted badly, even punching a hole in his wall. Now Sam is claiming he has an important coursework needing internet and can't pay right away, but the author isn't budging.\n\nSo, the main points here are about fairness of the agreement and the consequences. The author tried to enforce the agreement they had, which is understandable. But when the author blocked the internet, Sam was in the middle of doing something (maybe gaming, as mentioned) and then got angry. Now Sam is saying he can't do his work without internet and the author is being a bad friend.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author overstepped by blocking Sam's access. They had an agreement, and Sam didn't hold up his end. The author is trying to enforce that agreement by cutting off access. However, the author also mentions that Sam has an important piece of work to do now. But the author is standing firm because Sam still owes money. \n\nOn one hand, the author is right to expect payment for the internet they've covered. On the other hand, cutting off internet might affect Sam's academic work, which is a valid concern. But the author also points out that they have libraries on campus where he can work. So maybe there's an alternative for him. Also, Sam's behavior\u2014ignoring payments, then getting angry, damaging property, and then claiming money problems while still smoking weed\u2014makes his situation a bit more complex. \n\nThe author's actions were a response to Sam not fulfilling his financial responsibility. They tried negotiating first, then took action. The author isn't causing financial harm to themselves but to Sam, which is a way to enforce the agreement. However, the author's decision might be seen as harsh if it affects Sam's studies, but the author isn't in the wrong for expecting payment. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They set a clear boundary and tried to enforce it when the other person didn't meet their obligations. Even though there's a consequence for Sam, the author is within their rights to do so unless the agreement was different. The answer should be B (No).\n"
