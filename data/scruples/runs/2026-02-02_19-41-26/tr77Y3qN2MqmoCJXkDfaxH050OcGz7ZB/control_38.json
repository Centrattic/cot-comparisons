When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for blocking their housemate Sam's devices from the broadband because Sam hasn't paid his share for months. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. They live with three others, and initially, they agreed everyone would pay their share monthly. Sam didn't set up a standing order and missed payments for three months. The writer is now covering half the broadband cost. They confronted Sam, who said he'd pay when his girlfriend leaves, but he didn't. The writer then blocked his devices, leading to a conflict where Sam damaged a wall and now wants access for coursework.\n\nThe key points here are about responsibility, agreements, and consequences. The writer followed the initial agreement but Sam didn't contribute. The writer's action to block access is a form of enforcing the agreement. However, blocking internet access might affect Sam's studies and coursework, which he claims is important. But the writer argues that Sam's non-payment isn't impacting them financially right now, but they don't want to be taken advantage of.\n\nI need to consider if the action of blocking devices is justified. Since they had an agreement and Sam didn't hold up his end, the writer took action to secure their own financial responsibility. However, there's a potential issue with fairness and understanding. Sam's financial struggles might be real, but he's also smoking weed daily, which could be a point against his claims of money problems. The writer's action might be seen as necessary to enforce accountability, but maybe there's a better way to handle it without cutting off internet access, especially if it affects his studies.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer isn't being malicious; they're trying to get their money. The problem is that internet is crucial for university work, and cutting it off could hinder Sam's studies. But if the writer isn't being directly affected financially, maybe the action isn't necessary. However, the writer is still paying for Sam's share indirectly, so it's their right to enforce payment.\n\nIn terms of friendship, the writer wants to maintain it but also not be taken advantage of. The blocking might be a justified action to protect their own interests, even if it causes temporary inconvenience. Sam's reaction (tantrum, damaging property) shows poor handling of the situation, which might reflect on him rather than the writer.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the writer not being in the wrong because they followed the agreement and took action when Sam didn't. However, there's a nuance because internet access is critical for studies. But the agreement was about payment, and the writer is within their rights to enforce it. The damage Sam caused is on him, so the writer's action is more about enforcing the original agreement rather than being petty.\n"
