When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's internet access because the housemate hasn't paid his share for three months.\n\nFirst, the initial agreement was that everyone would pay their share monthly. The housemate, Sam, didn't set up a standing order, so the author had to prompt him. For a while, Sam paid when asked, but then stopped for three months. The author ended up paying his share, leading to a debt. The author confronted Sam, got a non-committal response, and then blocked his internet. Sam then damaged his wall and complained about the deposit and his hand.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. Legally, the author might not have the right to block internet access as it's a service they all agreed to pay for. However, since they're roommates and not in a formal contract, the situation is more about social norms. The author is trying to enforce a shared agreement, which could be seen as reasonable. But blocking internet access might affect Sam's studies and coursework, which is a valid concern. The author's actions could be seen as taking matters into their own hands, which might not be the best approach. However, they were trying to hold Sam accountable for his financial responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong, but there are better ways to handle it, like involving the landlord or a mediator. The answer hinges on whether enforcing payment through blocking access is fair, considering the potential impact on Sam's studies. But since the author is the one paying and the others didn't mind initially, maybe the action was justified. However, the author could have handled it differently. Considering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
