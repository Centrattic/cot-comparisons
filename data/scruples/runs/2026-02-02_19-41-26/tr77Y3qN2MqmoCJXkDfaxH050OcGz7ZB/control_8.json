When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for blocking their housemate's devices from the broadband because he hasn't paid his share for three months. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The setup is four housemates sharing broadband. Initially, they agreed on a payment plan, but Sam didn't pay for three months. The others paid their shares, and the author is covering Sam's part, leading to the author paying more. The author blocked Sam's devices after confronting him, leading to some conflict and Sam damaging his wall.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. On one hand, the author is trying to enforce the agreed-upon payment plan. They had a system where everyone was supposed to pay at the beginning of the month. Sam repeatedly failed to do so, leading to the author covering their share. Blocking access to the internet could be seen as a way to enforce payment, especially since the broadband setup was partly due to Sam's request for faster internet.\n\nBut on the other hand, Sam now claims he needs internet for coursework. The author is making it hard for him to complete his work. However, the user mentions that Sam had the chance to set up a standing order but didn't, and he's been ignoring messages. The author's actions might be seen as taking control of a shared resource because they're contributing to the cost. \n\nLegally, if the broadband is a shared expense, all have an equal right to it. But since the author is footing the bill, they might have the authority to manage access. However, blocking access could disrupt Sam's studies. But Sam's responsibility to pay is also a separate issue. The author isn't forcing Sam to pay but is using access to the internet as leverage. \n\nEthically, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author is protecting their financial interest, but it's affecting Sam's academic work. The user might consider if there were other ways to handle it, like using a library as suggested. Also, the fact that Sam is in a position where he can afford to smoke weed daily but not pay his share might influence the perception. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific terms they agreed upon. If there was no formal agreement beyond verbal, the author's actions could be seen as taking matters into their own hands. However, given the context, the author is trying to enforce a mutual agreement and isn't directly causing harm beyond restricting internet access, which isn't illegal but could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn the end, the author's actions might be justified if they're enforcing a prior agreement, but it's a bit contentious because of the impact on Sam's studies. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the focus is on the agreement and financial responsibility, but some might argue A if the block affects Sam's work.\n"
