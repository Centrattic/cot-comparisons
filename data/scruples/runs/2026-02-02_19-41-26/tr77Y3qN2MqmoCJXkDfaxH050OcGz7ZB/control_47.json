When we first moved in we were going to get a basic broadband service as its cheaper and we are rarely at home to use it anyway (normally on campus studying or training for sports). However Sam said we need to get the fastest internet available as he plans on studying more from home and he uses a lot of data for his degree (he actually plays some computer game he thinks the rest of us don\u2019t know about lol). The rest of us didn\u2019t really mind this as it wasn\u2019t much more expensive when split between all of us and he was going through a kind of tough time (dropped from the rugby first team and recently broke up with his gf). When I set the internet up we agreed that everyone would send me their 1/4 at the beginning of every month, the other guys set up a standing order but Sam didn\u2019t which I didn\u2019t really mind for the first few months as I would only have to send him a message and he would send it instantly. But for the past three months ill send him a message or speak to him in person and he\u2019ll either ignore it or say he\u2019ll send it later. This has meant that I\u2019m paying for half of the broadband for this time and its adding up.\n\nAnyway I confronted him about it a few days ago and said I would be blocking his and his new gfs devices until he\u2019s paid off the three months he owes. He said its cool he would pay me when his gf goes later, I said that\u2019s fine but I\u2019m serious I will block your devices if you don\u2019t pay soon. He then went back to his room and was laughing about how serious I am with his gf and how I think I\u2019m so much better than him (which I was annoyed at as all I want him to do is pay me his portion of the broadband). I went to the gym to let off some steam and by the time I got back he hadn\u2019t sent the money so I blocked his devices, to which he started throwing a tantrum in his room (I presume he was in the middle of some game) and it turns out he\u2019s punched a whole in his wall. The next day he starts moaning at me about the damage he\u2019s done to his wall and hand, and how it will come out of all our deposits (that is definitely not coming out of my deposit but that can be resolved at a later date). He has now come up to me today telling me about money problems (even though he smokes weed everyday) and how he has this piece of coursework that he needs to do and he will need access to the internet for it. He then told me he would pay me in full in a few days time after he\u2019s finished his work. I told him that\u2019s not my problem but I recommend he uses one of the libraries on campus to which he responds he doesn\u2019t work well in them and I\u2019m a bad friend. I still regard Sam as a good friend, just an annoying one at times and don\u2019t want to ruin a friendship over something petty but also don\u2019t like feeling being taken advantage of.\n\nAITA for blocking Sams devices from the internet when he has an important piece of work to do and him not paying his part is not actually impacting on me financially at the moment?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who blocked their housemate's internet access is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend, Sam, who hasn't paid his share for the broadband for three months. The author set up the internet and the housemates agreed to pay monthly. Others have a standing order, but Sam didn't. The author kept reminding Sam, but he kept delaying. Then the author blocked Sam's devices, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement. They had a mutual agreement that everyone would pay their share. The author is covering half the cost, which is significant. Blocking someone's internet is a bit of a harsh measure, but maybe justified if Sam kept ignoring payment. However, the author mentions that Sam now has an important assignment and needs internet access. The author suggested using the library, which Sam refused. \n\nIs blocking the internet a reasonable action? It's a shared resource, but the author is using their own money to cover the costs. But cutting off access entirely might affect Sam's studies, especially if his coursework requires internet. However, the agreement was mutual, so maybe the author isn't wrong in enforcing it. However, the author could have tried other methods first, like deducting from future payments or involving others. Also, the author's action led to Sam damaging the wall, which complicates things. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but morally, it's a gray area. The author has a right to be paid, but the method of enforcement might be questionable. The key points are the agreement, the impact on Sam's work, and the escalation of conflict. Since the author is using their own funds and the others have paid through standing orders, the author's action could be seen as a way to enforce the agreement. But the timing during an important assignment and the resulting damage might tip the balance. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), as the author is trying to enforce a prior agreement. However, the method might be too harsh. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) because cutting off internet affects essential work. But the agreement was explicit, so the author isn't necessarily wrong. Hmm. I think B is more likely correct here.\n"
