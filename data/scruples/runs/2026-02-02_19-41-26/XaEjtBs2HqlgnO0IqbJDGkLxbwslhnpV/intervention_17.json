I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy in a 3-year long-distance relationship. They had a break-up during his first deployment, but got back together. His girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, even though she did tell them they broke up. Now she's saying she's not dating anyone when they ask, or just mentions they talked. The author is frustrated and set a deadline for her to tell her friends, otherwise he might end the relationship. When he told her this, she got upset and accused him of not trusting her by bringing up unrelated issues.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author wants honesty and for their relationship to be acknowledged by her friends. He's been in the relationship longer, they got back together after a break-up, and he's clear about his needs. On the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, which might be due to her own reasons. The author is setting a boundary, which is okay, but maybe the way he communicated it was harsh? He gave a deadline, which could be seen as ultimatums, which are often a red flag. \n\nBut he mentions they're in a long-distance, which can make communication tricky. He's had to trust her during deployments, and now he wants her to reciprocate by being open with her friends. However, the girlfriend's response suggests she feels the author isn't trusting her either, bringing up other issues. That might indicate a lack of mutual trust on both sides. \n\nThe author's argument is that if you're in a relationship, you shouldn't hide it. That makes sense, but maybe the girlfriend has personal reasons for not telling her friends yet. The author is giving her a chance after 3 years, but setting a deadline could be seen as pressuring her. However, in a long-term relationship, boundaries about social circles are important. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting this boundary. If the girlfriend's behavior is making him feel insecure or like their relationship isn't recognized, then setting a deadline is his right. But if he's being controlling or not respecting her personal space, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, when he confronted her, she turned it around, which might mean she feels attacked. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he communicated it might have been abrupt. However, he did give her a chance to fix it over three years, which shows patience. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's needs. If the author's need for openness is legitimate and he's communicated it calmly, then he's not wrong. But if he's using an ultimatum without understanding her perspective, that's a problem. The fact that she's been hiding their relationship might indicate some issues, but he's also setting a boundary. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are about setting a necessary boundary for his own peace of mind and the relationship's health. However, the way he presented it could have been more empathetic. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" he's not necessarily wrong for wanting transparency, especially in a long-term relationship. The girlfriend's refusal to tell her friends might be the bigger issue here. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
