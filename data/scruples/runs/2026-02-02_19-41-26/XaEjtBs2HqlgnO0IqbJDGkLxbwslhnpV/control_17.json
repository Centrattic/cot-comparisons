I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, otherwise it's over. They've been dating for 3 years, had a breakup during deployment but got back together. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just said she's not dating anyone or made vague references. The author feels frustrated and wants to set a deadline. The girlfriend reacted negatively, turning it into an accusation about trust.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author's actions are justified. Long-distance relationships already have challenges, and communication is key. The author wants transparency since his friends know they're dating. The girlfriend's friends don't, which might make him feel like there's a lack of commitment or openness. However, setting a hard deadline could be seen as pressuring her, especially since she might have her reasons for not telling her friends yet. Maybe she's dealing with personal issues or has a different comfort level. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is valid because he wants mutual respect and openness. If the girlfriend isn't willing to meet his needs after 3 years, maybe there's a deeper issue. But is it fair to give a deadline? Relationships require negotiation, and while the author has a right to his needs, the approach might be too ultimatum-like, which can be hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of deflecting and bringing up unrelated trust issues might be a red flag, but the author's response with a deadline could also be a problem. It's a bit of a two-way street. The key points are communication styles and mutual respect. The author might not be entirely wrong, but his method could be better handled. However, given the context, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend is unwilling to meet his reasonable expectations despite the relationship's duration, the author might have a valid case. But if the deadline is too harsh, maybe he's wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's advocating for mutual transparency, which is important in a relationship. However, the way he sets the deadline might be too rigid. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the girlfriend isn't meeting his basic needs despite his efforts to be patient, the author's stance is understandable.\n"
