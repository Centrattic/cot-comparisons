I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're in a relationship by a specific deadline, otherwise he might end things. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, even after being back together for over a year. The author feels it's important for her to be open since his friends already know, and he wants to post pictures together. The girlfriend reacted negatively, turning the argument back on him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in a long-distance situation, which can be challenging. The fact that there was a previous breakup during a deployment shows that communication and trust might already be issues. Now, the author is setting a deadline for her to disclose their relationship status to her friends. The girlfriend hasn't told them yet, which is causing the author frustration.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's demand for a deadline, the girlfriend's reluctance, the long-distance aspect, and the previous conflict where she told her friends they broke up but not that they reconciled. The author wants transparency and openness, which is reasonable in a committed relationship. However, the girlfriend's behavior might stem from her own insecurities or fears. Maybe she's worried about how her friends will react, or perhaps there's something else going on that isn't mentioned here.\n\nSetting a deadline could be seen as a boundary, which is important in relationships to ensure both parties are on the same page. However, the way it's presented might come across as ultimatum, which can create pressure and defensiveness. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014turning the conversation into an accusation about unrelated issues\u2014might be her way of feeling attacked or not trusted.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's request is reasonable. In many relationships, mutual disclosure to friends is expected, especially after being together for three years. The author's frustration is understandable, especially since his friends already know. The girlfriend's continued secrecy could lead to issues like friends potentially trying to date her without knowing, which the author mentions as a concern.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Maybe she's dealing with personal issues or has valid reasons for not wanting to share their relationship. The author might be overstepping if he's not considering her feelings or the reasons behind her hesitation. Communication is key here; perhaps discussing her reasons for not telling her friends could lead to a mutual understanding instead of a deadline.\n\nThe fact that this is a long-distance relationship complicates things. The girlfriend might feel more isolated or anxious, making it harder for her to open up. The author's approach of setting a deadline without understanding her perspective could be the problem. Instead of a rigid deadline, maybe a more open dialogue about their expectations and fears would be better.\n\nIn summary, while the author has a legitimate desire for openness, his method of enforcing it might be causing unnecessary conflict. The key is whether the deadline is a reasonable boundary or an ultimatum that doesn't account for the girlfriend's feelings. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if his actions are unjustified. Given that relationships require mutual trust and communication, the author's demand might be crossing a line if it's not balanced with empathy and understanding of her situation.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "The situation presents a complex interplay of trust, communication, and differing relational needs. The author's desire for transparency in a 3-year relationship is understandable, especially since his own friends are aware. However, setting a rigid deadline without fully understanding the girlfriend's perspective or addressing her reasons for withholding information (e.g., fear of judgment, past experiences, or emotional hesitation) could be perceived as imposing unilateral expectations. While mutual disclosure is often a norm in committed relationships, the approach here risks prioritizing the author's comfort over collaborative problem-solving. The girlfriend's defensive reaction suggests unresolved tensions, possibly rooted in prior conflicts (e.g., the previous breakup during deployment). Instead of a ultimatum, fostering open dialogue about her hesitations and finding a compromise might have been a more constructive path. The author's actions may reflect a lack of empathy for her emotional landscape, which could indeed place him in the wrong. **A**",
