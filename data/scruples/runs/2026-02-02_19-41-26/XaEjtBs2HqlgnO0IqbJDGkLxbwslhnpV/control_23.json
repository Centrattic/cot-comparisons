I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the guy is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, and if she doesn't, he thinks it won't work between them anymore. They've been dating for three years with a breakup in between. She hasn't told her friends after getting back together, just told them she's not dating anyone or mentioned seeing him. He wants her to be open about their relationship so his friends know not to hit on her, and he's setting a deadline. She got upset, accused him of lying about other things, and didn't say \"I love you\" later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy feels that after three years, hiding the relationship isn't acceptable. He's setting a boundary, which is his right. However, in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings earlier instead of setting a strict deadline. On the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends, but maybe there are reasons she hasn't. Maybe she's anxious, or there's something else. She might feel pressured, especially since they're long-distance, which can already be challenging. \n\nThe question is whether the guy is wrong. He's setting a boundary, which is understandable, but the way he approached it might have been abrupt. He mentions he's been frustrated for a while, so maybe he should have talked about it earlier. However, he's given her time over the past year after getting back together. He's not forcing her to tell her family, just friends. The girlfriend's response was to deflect and accuse him of lying, which isn't helpful. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to meet each other's needs. If he needs openness and she's not able or willing to do that, maybe it's a deal-breaker. But was he wrong to set that deadline? It's his right to have that expectation. However, the argument might be that in a relationship, you shouldn't use ultimatums unless you're ready to walk away. Since he's willing to give it a chance, maybe the deadline was too harsh. \n\nBut considering that they're long-distance, maybe the timeline is reasonable. She's been avoiding it for over a year. The key point is mutual trust and communication. If she's not being honest with her friends, maybe that's a red flag for him. However, he should have discussed this with her more before setting a strict deadline. \n\nOverall, the guy isn't entirely in the wrong because he's expressing his needs. However, his approach might have been too harsh. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), because he's not wrong for setting a boundary, but there's room for improvement in communication. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also problematic, but the main question is about the author's wrongness.\n"
