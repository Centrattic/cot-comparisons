I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, otherwise he'll break up with her. They've been together for 3 years but had a breakup during a deployment. She hasn't told her friends they're back together, only her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy wants public commitment, which is understandable, especially after 3 years. But he's setting a firm deadline and threatening to end things if she doesn't meet it. His girlfriend seems uncomfortable, maybe because she's avoiding some social situations or has privacy concerns. She's using vague statements to her friends, which he doesn't accept. She also turned the conversation back on him by bringing up unrelated trust issues.\n\nIs the guy in the wrong? Well, communication is crucial in relationships. He's expressing his needs, which is important, but maybe the way he's doing it is too harsh. Setting a deadline could be seen as ultimatum, which can be damaging. However, considering the long-distance aspect and the time they've been together, his need for mutual commitment makes sense. The girlfriend might have her reasons for not wanting to share their relationship, but that doesn't excuse her not being honest. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's reaction when she didn't respond as he hoped (like not saying \"I love you\") could be seen as emotionally manipulative, like the \"say it back\" tactic. Also, turning the pressure onto trust issues might be a way to deflect. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, maybe the guy isn't entirely wrong. He's trying to set boundaries for his own emotional needs, which is valid. But the method might be problematic. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and the girlfriend hasn't communicated her reasons or worked on this issue, the guy's stance could be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
