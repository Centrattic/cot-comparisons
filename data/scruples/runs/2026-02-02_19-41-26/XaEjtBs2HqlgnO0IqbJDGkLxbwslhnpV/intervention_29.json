I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're dating, even after 3 years. The author set a deadline for her to do so, and if she doesn't, he's considering breaking up. The girlfriend's friends think she's not dating anyone, but he's told his friends they're together. He's frustrated because he wants to be open and share photos, but she's been hiding it. She reacted negatively, turning the situation back on him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Long-distance relationships can be tough, especially when there's a need for mutual trust and transparency. The author has given her time\u20143 years, with a break-up already in there. He's setting a boundary, which is understandable if he feels the lack of openness is a deal-breaker for him. Setting a deadline might come off as ultimatums, which can be stressful, but if that's what he's decided is necessary for his peace of mind, maybe it's his right to do so.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends, which might be due to her own reasons. Maybe she's private, or there's something else she's not sharing. The author accuses her of hiding something, but she's deflecting by questioning his trust in her. It's a classic case of communication issues. The key here is whether the author's approach was fair. Did he give her enough time and support to come around, or was he too abrupt in setting that deadline?\n\nAlso, the fact that they're in a long-distance adds complexity. She might have valid reasons for not telling her friends yet, maybe social anxiety, past experiences, or just not being ready. But the author feels that after three years, it's time to move forward. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs and setting personal boundaries. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he wants to be open about their relationship. However, setting a deadline with a threat of breaking up might be heavy-handed. It's possible he didn't approach it with enough empathy, considering her feelings and reasons. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt attacked, which is a common response when someone is confronted with a demand.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe the author should have discussed this more gently, understanding her perspective before setting a firm deadline. But he also has needs and boundaries. If transparency is a core value for him, then he's not wrong for wanting it. However, the way he communicated it might have been the issue. Instead of an ultimatum, a collaborative approach to find a solution might have been better.\n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on how he handled the situation. If he was respectful and gave her a chance to explain, maybe not. But if he was dismissive of her feelings, then yes. The answer isn't clear-cut. However, since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to evaluate if that's accurate. The girlfriend's deflection and the author's ultimatum both point to poor communication from both sides. But the main question is about the author's actions. If he had a valid reason (wanting openness) and gave her time, he's not entirely wrong. But if he forced her without understanding, maybe he is. The answer might be A or B based on this analysis.\n"
