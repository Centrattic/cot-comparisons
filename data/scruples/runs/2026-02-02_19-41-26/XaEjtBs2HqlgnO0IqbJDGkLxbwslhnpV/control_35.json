I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the guy is setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been together for three years with a past breakup during deployment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, only her family. The guy is frustrated and sets a deadline, which leads to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective is that after three years, it's important for mutual trust and commitment that both partners are open about their relationship. He's tried to give her chances and wants to move forward. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that setting a deadline is pressuring her, especially in a long-distance context where communication can be more challenging. Her reaction, where she turned the argument back on him, might indicate her feelings of being cornered or defensive.\n\nThe key points here are the duration of the relationship, the long-distance aspect, and the importance of transparency. The guy's friends already know, so there's a discrepancy in their openness. The girlfriend's solution of saying she's not dating anyone might be her way of handling the situation, but the guy finds it insufficient. The question is whether his setting a deadline is reasonable or overstepping.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual expectations are crucial. The guy's frustration is valid, as he wants his relationship to be acknowledged. However, setting a strict deadline could be seen as ultimatum, which might be harsh. The girlfriend's delay in informing her friends could be due to personal reasons not mentioned, like fear of judgment or past experiences. It's possible that the guy's approach is causing more stress instead of resolving the issue.\n\nThe community's suggestion to break up is a common reaction, but the guy is trying to give her another chance. His argument that there's no reason to hide unless something's wrong is logical, but relationships aren't always black and white. The girlfriend's defensiveness might indicate deeper issues, like trust problems or insecurity, which the deadline exacerbates.\n\nConsidering all this, the guy's intention is to address a legitimate concern, but his method might be too rigid. The right approach would involve discussing the issue without ultimatums, understanding her perspective, and finding a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. While his approach might be flawed, his desire for openness isn't inherently wrong. On the other hand, his deadline could be seen as unfair pressure. The answer might hinge on whether setting a deadline is reasonable given the circumstances. Given the long-term nature of the relationship, the guy's stance could be justified, but the way he handled it might contribute to the conflict. So, the answer might be B (No), but with caveats about communication styles.\n"
