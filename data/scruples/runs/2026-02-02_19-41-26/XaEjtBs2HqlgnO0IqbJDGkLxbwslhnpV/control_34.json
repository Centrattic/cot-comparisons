I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been dating for three years, including a period where they were apart due to deployment. They broke up temporarily, then got back together. The main issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, and the author is giving her a deadline to do so. He's frustrated because he wants their relationship to be public, especially since his friends already know. When he sets this deadline, she reacts negatively, even bringing up unrelated trust issues.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is in a long-distance relationship, which can be tough. He wants transparency and recognition from her friends. It's reasonable for him to expect that his partner be open about their relationship, especially after three years. But does setting a deadline and threatening to break up if she doesn't meet it make him the asshole?\n\nOn one hand, he's justified in wanting her to be truthful with her friends. If her friends think they're not together, it could lead to misunderstandings or even someone else pursuing her. On the other hand, setting a strict deadline and threatening the relationship might be seen as ultimatums, which can be heavy-handed. Relationships require mutual effort, and maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of waiting until now to enforce a deadline.\n\nAlso, her reaction suggests she might feel pressured or not ready to make the relationship public with her friends. Maybe there's more to her hesitation that he hasn't considered. If she's been hiding their relationship to some extent, there could be underlying reasons, like past experiences or fear of judgment from her friends.\n\nBut the user mentions that after getting back together, she told her friends they broke up but not that they reconciled. That seems like a red flag. If she's been misleading her friends about their relationship status, it's reasonable for the author to be concerned. However, the way he's approaching the issue\u2014setting a deadline and ultimatum\u2014might not be the healthiest way to resolve it. Open communication and understanding each other's perspectives are key in relationships.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He has valid concerns about transparency. But using an ultimatum might not be the best approach. However, given the three-year timeline and the fact that she hasn't addressed this issue, his frustration is understandable. The answer might depend on whether setting a deadline with a breakup threat is appropriate. Some might argue that it's reasonable if she hasn't acted on his concerns for so long, while others might say it's too harsh.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (option B) because he's asserting his need for openness in the relationship. However, there's a balance to strike between being understanding and setting boundaries. The key is whether the deadline was communicated with empathy and if there was prior discussion. If he's been patient for three years and this is his first time setting a clear boundary, it's a valid step. But if he's been dismissive of her feelings, that's another issue. The fact that she turned the conversation to trust issues suggests possible deflection on her part. So, the author's stance might be justified, making him not the asshole here.\n"
