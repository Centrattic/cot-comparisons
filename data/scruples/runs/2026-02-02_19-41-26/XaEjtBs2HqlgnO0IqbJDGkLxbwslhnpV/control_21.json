I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. Let me parse through the details.\n\nSo, the author is in a 3-year long-distance relationship with their girlfriend. They had a breakup during a deployment but reconciled. The key issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together. She's told her family but not friends. The author is frustrated because they can't post pictures together and want her friends to know they're dating. The author set a deadline for her to tell her friends, and if she doesn't, they think the relationship won't work. The girlfriend reacted negatively, accused the author of lying about unrelated things, and didn't say \"I love you\" afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Both partners have rights to their feelings. The author feels that after 3 years, transparency is important. But maybe the girlfriend has her reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's private, or there's something else going on. The author giving an ultimatum might be a bit harsh, but they did say they want to give her a chance to fix it. \n\nLong-distance relationships are tough. The author mentions that their friends know they're dating, which is different. They want mutual transparency. It's reasonable to expect the same from their partner. However, setting a strict deadline with a breakup consequence could be seen as pressuring the girlfriend, especially if she's struggling with it. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014deflecting and bringing up unrelated issues\u2014might indicate she feels attacked, which is a common response when someone is put on the spot.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for wanting openness. If both partners are honest about their needs, then the girlfriend's refusal to meet this need is a problem. But the author's approach might have been too confrontational. Maybe a more collaborative approach would have been better, discussing why she's hesitant and finding a solution together instead of setting a firm deadline.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's request for transparency is valid, and in any relationship, both need to be open. However, the method of communication and the ultimatum could be problematic. Maybe the girlfriend felt cornered, leading to her defensive response. The author also didn't consider her perspective and possible reasons for not telling her friends. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting to be open, but their approach might have been harsh. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also an issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the situation, the answer might be B (No), because the author's request for honesty is reasonable, but their delivery could be improved. However, if the focus is solely on the action (setting a deadline), maybe it's a grey area. But since the user wants a clear A or B, and given the context, the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking transparency, but the way they communicated it might be a problem. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer is B.\n"
