I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the author sets a deadline for the girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The girlfriend didn't do that, and when the author brings it up, she reacts negatively, turning the conversation back on him. The author thinks he's not the one to blame, but wants to know if others agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They've been dating for three years, had a breakup during deployment, got back together, and now there's this issue with her not telling friends. The author feels frustrated and wants to set a boundary. He's setting a deadline, which is a significant step. The girlfriend's reaction is defensive, bringing up unrelated issues like trusting him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries is normal in relationships. However, the way he communicated it might be an issue. By giving a deadline, he's making it a ultimatum, which could be seen as controlling. On the other hand, he's expressing his needs, which is also valid. The girlfriend's response is maybe more problematic because she's defensive and brings up other issues instead of addressing his concern.\n\nBut here's the thing: in a long-distance relationship, communication is key. The author might feel that transparency is necessary for trust. However, expecting someone to meet a deadline for something like telling friends can depend on her personal comfort level. Maybe she's dealing with her own reasons for not sharing the relationship yet. The author's frustration is understandable, but setting a deadline could be seen as pressuring her, which might not be healthy.\n\nAlso, when she turned the conversation to his possible lies and parties, that's a classic deflection. But the author's initial action of setting a deadline could have been a trigger for her defensiveness. The key here is whether the deadline was communicated respectfully and if it's a reasonable expectation. If the author gave her space to come around but now is setting a firm deadline, maybe he's justified. But if he's been impatient for a long time, maybe the approach was harsh.\n\nIn some relationships, partners have different comfort levels about sharing their relationship status. The author wants openness, which is reasonable, but the girlfriend might have her reasons for keeping it private. The author's ultimatum might be crossing a line, but he's also standing up for his needs. It's a tricky balance between respecting each other's boundaries and addressing one's own needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? It depends. If he gave her time and then set a clear boundary, maybe not. But if the deadline was too abrupt or not discussed properly, he might have overstepped. The girlfriend's reaction is also part of the problem, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he's standing up for his needs in a long-term relationship, maybe he's not the one at fault. However, the way he communicated it could be improved. But overall, in terms of being in the wrong, perhaps the answer is B (No), because he's advocating for his needs, even if the method could be better.\n"
