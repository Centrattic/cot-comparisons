I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, including a breakup and reconciliation after a deployment. The key issue is the author setting a deadline for the girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together a long time, which suggests the author values openness and commitment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, even though she did tell her family. The author feels that this is a red flag because hiding the relationship could lead to complications, like friends getting close to her. He's frustrated and sets a deadline, which causes tension.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. In a long-distance situation, communication is crucial. The author might feel that transparency is important for trust. However, setting a strict deadline with the threat of breaking up if not met could be seen as ultimatum-like. Ultimatums can be damaging because they don't allow for mutual discussion and can create pressure. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is to deflect by bringing up unrelated issues, which might indicate she feels attacked or unfairly judged. The author's approach might not have been the most constructive. Instead of setting a firm deadline, perhaps discussing the importance of her friends knowing and negotiating a timeline together would have been better. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's anxious about their reactions, or there are past issues. The author hasn't explored her perspective deeply, just imposed his expectations. \n\nBut then, the author did mention that his friends already know, so he's consistent. However, relationships require compromise. The author's frustration is valid, but using a deadline with the threat of ending the relationship might be too harsh, especially without understanding her side. \n\nOn the other hand, after three years, the author might genuinely feel that this is a deal-breaker. If honesty and openness are core to the relationship, then not being honest with her friends could be a problem. Yet, the way he approached it could have been more empathetic.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's right to want transparency vs. the method of enforcing it. The key issue is the ultimatum. Setting a deadline without considering her feelings or reasons could be wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the author's expectations are reasonable and the girlfriend is being uncooperative, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
