I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author has been dating their girlfriend for three years, including a breakup and getting back together. The main issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, and the author is setting a deadline for her to do so, otherwise they might break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They're in a long-distance relationship, which can make communication tricky. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, even though the author's friends know. The author feels it's important for mutual transparency, especially since they want to be open and share pictures, etc. The girlfriend's response was defensive, bringing up trust issues about the author possibly lying about other things.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is at fault here. So, breaking it down: setting a deadline for communication might be reasonable if it's a significant issue for the relationship. However, in a long-distance relationship, communication can be more complex. The girlfriend might have her reasons for not telling her friends, maybe fear of judgment, personal boundaries, or past experiences. The author's frustration is valid if they feel their relationship is being hidden, but imposing a deadline could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's not ready.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a problem that's been ongoing for a while. They've given her time before, but now setting a clear boundary might be necessary for their own needs. The girlfriend's deflection about trust might indicate deeper issues, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong to set boundaries.\n\nI need to check if the author is overstepping by setting such a deadline. In relationships, both partners should have the right to set boundaries. However, if the girlfriend is uncomfortable with publicizing their relationship, the author's insistence could be causing unnecessary conflict. It's a balance between the author's need for openness and the girlfriend's personal space or fears.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the breakup during deployment and the subsequent stress, maybe the girlfriend is dealing with anxiety or insecurity. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive of her feelings if it's not discussed empathetically. But given the time frame (3 years), the author might feel it's reasonable to expect some level of public acknowledgment.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how they communicated their needs and whether they considered her feelings. If the deadline was set without understanding her perspective, then maybe the author shares some responsibility. But if the author is clear about their needs and the girlfriend is unwilling to meet them, it's a mutual issue. However, the act of setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong. The problem might be in the approach rather than the requirement itself. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with a note about communication style.\n"
