I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation is a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years. There was a breakup during the first deployment, but they got back together after. The main issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're dating again. She told her family but not her friends. Her current approach is either saying she's not dating anyone or giving vague answers when her friends ask about the guy. The author is frustrated because he wants her friends to know they're dating so he can post pictures together and have her friends know not to hit on her. He sets a deadline for her to tell her friends, and if she doesn't, he thinks the relationship won't work. When he brought this up, she got defensive and accused him of lying about unrelated things.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. Long-distance relationships are already challenging, and communication is key. The author has made it clear that he wants her friends to know they're dating. He's not just being passive; he's given her a deadline. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, which is causing him frustration. He wants transparency and for her friends to know so there's no ambiguity. She, on the other hand, is keeping it vague, which could lead to misunderstandings or even her friends possibly trying to date her, which he's trying to prevent.\n\nThe author argues that there's no reason to hide unless there's something to hide. That makes sense because in a committed relationship, especially a long one, both partners should be open about their status. However, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not telling her friends yet. Maybe she's not ready, or there's some personal issue. The problem is that the author feels it's important for the relationship to move forward, and she's not meeting his needs. \n\nNow, setting a deadline could be seen as a way to resolve the issue, but it's a significant step. If she's not ready, it might push her away. However, the author has been patient for three years, including after the breakup. He's given her time, and now he's setting a boundary. When he brought it up, she turned the accusation around, which might indicate that she's defensive or doesn't see the issue the same way. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, both partners should have mutual respect and communicate their needs. The author is expressing his need for openness, which is valid. The girlfriend isn't fulfilling that need, which is causing conflict. However, it's also possible that the author is being too rigid by setting a firm deadline without understanding her perspective. Relationships require compromise. \n\nBut considering the duration of the relationship and the fact that it's long-distance, the author's frustration is understandable. Long-distance requires a lot of trust and communication, and not being able to publicly state the relationship status can create tension. The girlfriend's approach of saying she's not dating anyone or being vague isn't helping. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is setting a boundary, which is his right. The girlfriend isn't meeting his expectations, which is her choice. However, the fact that she turned the conversation into an accusation about unrelated things might indicate that she's deflecting or not taking his concerns seriously. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his needs and setting a deadline, especially after three years. The girlfriend's response suggests she might not be ready or there's another issue. But the author could have handled it with more empathy. However, given the context, he's within his rights to expect openness in a committed relationship. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
