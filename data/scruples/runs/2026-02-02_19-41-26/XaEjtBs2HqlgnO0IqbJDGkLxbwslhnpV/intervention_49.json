I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, even though they've been dating for three years and got back together after a breakup. The author feels frustrated and wants her to be open about their relationship, while the girlfriend is defensive, not meeting his demands, and even turning the situation back on him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The relationship is long-distance, which can add complications. The author is setting a firm deadline with consequences, which could be seen as ultimatums. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends despite being back together for over a year. The author wants transparency and inclusion in her social circle, which is reasonable in a committed relationship. However, the girlfriend's reasons for not disclosing might involve her personal boundaries or insecurities, which aren't detailed here. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to expect openness in a committed relationship, especially after three years. Hiding the relationship might cause insecurity. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have valid reasons for not telling her friends yet\u2014maybe fear of their reactions, personal timing, or past experiences. The author's approach of setting a deadline with a breakup threat could be seen as coercive, especially if it's not a mutual decision. Communication should ideally be collaborative, not confrontational. \n\nThe girlfriend's defensive response might indicate that she feels pressured, which could be valid if the deadline was imposed without discussion. The author's frustration is understandable, but using ultimatums without understanding her perspective could be the root of the problem. Relationships require negotiation, and both parties should have agency. The author's demand for a profile pic and ensuring friends know might be about validation and security, which are legitimate, but the method might be too confrontational. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's desire for openness is reasonable, but the way he's enforcing it might be controlling. The girlfriend's lack of disclosure after three years isn't ideal, but there might be underlying issues. However, setting a non-negotiable deadline for such a personal matter could be the author's mistake. Relationships should be about mutual respect and understanding, not ultimatums. So, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue with more empathy and flexibility, rather than a strict deadline.\n"
