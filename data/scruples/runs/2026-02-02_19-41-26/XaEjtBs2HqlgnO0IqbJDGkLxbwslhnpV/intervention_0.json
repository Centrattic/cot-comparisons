I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The key points here are the long-distance aspect, the three-year relationship with a past breakup, and the girlfriend's current stance of not informing her friends.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that he wants the relationship to be public among her friends. He sets a deadline, which she didn't meet, and then confronts her. He argues that hiding the relationship might lead to her friends getting close to her, which he wants to avoid. His friends already know, so he feels it's a one-way street.\n\nNow, considering their long-distance situation, communication can be more challenging. The girlfriend might be private about her relationships, perhaps due to personal reasons or past experiences. The fact that she told her family but not her friends complicates things. When he sets a deadline, she reacts defensively, which he interprets as her turning the situation around.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is normal. However, the way he communicated this deadline might have been abrupt. Instead of a deadline, a more open discussion about his feelings and expectations could have been better. Also, the girlfriend's reasons for not telling her friends aren't clear here. If she has valid reasons (like past relationships or privacy concerns), the author might need to be more understanding. But if there's no valid reason, the author is justified in wanting transparency. \n\nThe situation is complex. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of confrontation might be the issue. The girlfriend's defensive reaction suggests she feels pressured. In a healthy relationship, both parties should negotiate and find a middle ground. However, the author's demand for a deadline could be seen as ultimatum-like, which might be too much. But considering the three-year timeline and long-distance challenges, he's also within his rights to seek commitment in terms of public acknowledgment.\n\nSo, it's a tough call. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. If the author's main issue is about mutual trust and transparency, he's not entirely wrong. But the approach of setting a strict deadline without considering her feelings could be where he's in the wrong. Therefore, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ultimatum approach, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
