I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the boyfriend is upset that his girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're dating, even after 3 years and a previous breakup. He sets a deadline for her to do so, and she reacts negatively, turning it around on him by questioning his trust in her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend feels that after three years, especially being back together for over a year, it's time for her to be open with her friends. He wants to take pictures and have a profile picture, which implies a level of public commitment. He's frustrated because her current approach (saying she's not dating anyone but acknowledging interactions) isn't enough for him. He gives her a deadline, which leads to conflict when she responds by accusing him of not trusting her and bringing up unrelated issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends, which might be due to personal reasons. Maybe she's private, or there's some history she's protecting. She's in a long-distance relationship, which can be challenging, and maybe she's struggling with how to handle telling her friends. Her reaction of deflecting and questioning his trust could indicate that she feels cornered or that he's overstepping.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The boyfriend has a right to want his relationship to be acknowledged, especially given the time they've been together. Setting a deadline could be seen as reasonable if he's given her the chance over time and she hasn't acted. However, the way he approached it might have contributed to the conflict. Giving a clear deadline could be seen as ultimatum, which can be hurtful. Also, her reaction might stem from feeling that he's not respecting her boundaries or the situation they're in (long-distance can require more privacy sometimes).\n\nThe girlfriend's response about trust is a red herring if she's bringing up unrelated issues. That could be a manipulation tactic to shift the blame. But maybe there are underlying trust issues both ways. The boyfriend's frustration is valid if he feels the relationship's public acknowledgment is important for his well-being. However, he should consider her perspective and reasons for not sharing yet.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to have open communication. If he's been concerned about this for a while, maybe he should have discussed it earlier without setting an ultimatum. Setting a deadline might be necessary if he's at a breaking point, but the way he presented it might have escalated the situation. The girlfriend's deflection and accusations could be a sign of deeper issues, like fear of commitment or not being ready to take that step yet.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He has valid reasons for wanting her to share their relationship with friends, but the approach might have been too abrupt. On the other hand, her not sharing could be a sign of something more serious, like not being fully committed. Since he's given her multiple chances and she hasn't acted, maybe setting a deadline is justified. However, the way he handled the conversation might have been too harsh, leading to a defensive reaction from her. \n\nOverall, it's a mix of both parties needing to communicate better. The boyfriend isn't entirely in the wrong because he's setting boundaries, but he could have approached it differently. The girlfriend's reaction is problematic because she's deflecting. The answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but there's room for both to improve. However, since the question asks if he's in the wrong, and he's setting boundaries based on his needs, the answer is likely B.\n"
