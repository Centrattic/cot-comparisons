I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author set a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The girlfriend didn't do that yet, and when the author mentioned a cut-off date, she reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been dating for three years, had a breakup, and are back together. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just her family and some vague mentions. The author feels it's important for their relationship's legitimacy, wanting to be open and avoid jealousy from her friends. He set a deadline, and she reacted by turning the conversation around, accusing him of not trusting her.\n\nNow, the key points here: Long-distance relationships can be tough on communication and trust. The author's expectation is reasonable in wanting mutual transparency. However, setting a deadline with a threat to end the relationship might be seen as ultimatum behavior. On the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't been fully open, which could make the author feel insecure.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he wants recognition and trust. But the way he handled it\u2014setting a hard deadline and then the girlfriend deflecting\u2014might indicate deeper issues. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might feel untrustworthy or maybe she has her own reasons for not disclosing. However, the author's approach could come off as controlling if he's not listening to her perspective.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be right to want open communication, but using a deadline as a threat could be seen as manipulative. The girlfriend's deflection also points to possible trust issues on her side. But both parties need to work on communication. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong, but his method could have been more collaborative. It's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's setting boundaries and expressing his needs, that's not inherently wrong. However, the way he's enforcing it might be. But given the context, he's trying to address a legitimate need for mutual transparency, which is important in a committed relationship. So the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong, but there's a nuance here.\n"
