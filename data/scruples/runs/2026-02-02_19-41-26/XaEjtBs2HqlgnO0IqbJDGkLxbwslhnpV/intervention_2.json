I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, otherwise they might break up. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, even though they've been dating for three years with a brief breakup in between. She's told her family and gives vague answers to her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is setting a deadline for the girlfriend to be more public about their relationship. The girlfriend hasn't done it yet, and when confronted, she got defensive and accused the author of unrelated issues. The key factors here are communication, trust, and mutual respect.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-distance ones, communication is crucial. The author might feel frustrated because they want their relationship to be public, which is understandable. But setting a strict deadline with consequences could be seen as ultimatums, which are generally not healthy. However, some people set boundaries to address concerns like social validation or safety (e.g., friends knowing not to date her).\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be struggling with personal reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's anxious, or there's some social pressure. The author's approach might be abrupt, not allowing her the time she needs to work through her feelings. However, after three years, the author's frustration is valid, and wanting to move forward together is reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014deflecting and bringing up unrelated trust issues\u2014could indicate her discomfort with the pressure. It's possible she feels cornered, leading to her defensive behavior. The author's requirement for public acknowledgment is a boundary, but how it's enforced matters. Ultimatums can be damaging if not discussed thoroughly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. It's a judgment call. The author expressed their needs, which is important, but the method might lack consideration for the girlfriend's feelings. However, setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's refusal to meet the deadline might also be a red flag for the author. \n\nIn some relationships, transparency is a deal-breaker. If the author values public acknowledgment and the girlfriend can't meet that after discussion, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting that. However, the way the deadline was imposed without understanding her perspective might be the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The author's frustration is justified, but the approach could be more empathetic. But since the question is whether they're in the wrong, I think it's a balance. The author isn't entirely wrong for having these expectations, but the method of enforcing them could be better. However, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but after analysis, maybe it's a mix. However, in the TOS or guidelines, sometimes setting boundaries is okay, but ultimatums can be problematic. The answer might hinge on whether the author's approach was respectful and communicative enough. Given the scenario, the author might be seen as in the right (B), but there are elements where they could improve. Since the options are A or B, and the user's initial thought was A, but after considering, maybe B is plausible if boundaries are acceptable.\n"
