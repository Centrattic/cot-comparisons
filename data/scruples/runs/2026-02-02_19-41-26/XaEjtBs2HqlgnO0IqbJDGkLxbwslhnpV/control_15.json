I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, including a breakup during a deployment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, and the author is setting a deadline for her to do so, threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't. The girlfriend reacted negatively, turning the conversation back on the author by bringing up unrelated trust issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author wants transparency and for their relationship to be public, especially since their friends know they're together. The girlfriend's actions\u2014saying she hasn't told her friends she's dating anyone and giving vague answers\u2014are seen as hiding the relationship. The author feels that hiding the relationship is a red flag, so they're setting a boundary. But is that unreasonable?\n\nIn many relationships, especially long-distance ones, communication and mutual understanding are crucial. The author has given the girlfriend over a year to address this after getting back together. Setting a deadline could be seen as a boundary to ensure both parties are on the same page. However, the way the author presented it\u2014threatening to end things if the deadline isn't met\u2014might come across as ultimatum-like, which can be stressful and damaging. \n\nThe girlfriend's response, accusing the author of unrelated issues, might indicate her discomfort or defensiveness. But does that make the author wrong? The author's frustration is valid, given the time invested and the lack of progress. However, imposing a strict deadline without considering her feelings or reasons could be heavy-handed. \n\nCultural and personal factors also play a role. Some people might prioritize privacy more, so maybe the girlfriend has reasons for not sharing. The author's insistence on public acknowledgment is a personal need, which is okay, but expecting the girlfriend to meet that need without understanding her perspective might be where the author is in the gray area.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about transparency, the approach of setting a hard deadline and threatening to end the relationship could be seen as extreme. Relationships require compromise, and perhaps the author should have communicated their needs more collaboratively rather than unilaterally setting a deadline. So, the author might share some responsibility here.\n"
