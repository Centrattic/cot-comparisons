I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author told their girlfriend she has a deadline to tell her friends they're dating, otherwise it's not going to work. The girlfriend was taken aback, got short/frustrated, and didn't say \"I love you too\" after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They've been dating for 3 years with a breakup in between. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends that they're back together. She's only said she's not dating anyone or mentioned seeing him when he was in town. The author is frustrated because they want to be open and take pictures, and they feel hiding the relationship isn't healthy. The girlfriend turned it into an accusation about trust, even though the author's friends already know.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is important. The author wants the relationship to be public, which is reasonable if they want to be committed. However, setting a deadline and threatening to end the relationship if the girlfriend doesn't comply could be seen as ultimatums, which can put pressure on the other person. The girlfriend might feel that her needs or reasons for not telling her friends aren't being considered. Maybe she's insecure or has past issues she hasn't worked out. But the author's frustration is also valid because they want mutual transparency. The girlfriend's response about trust is a bit of a deflection, but maybe she's feeling defensive. The fact that the author's friends know but hers don't is a discrepancy they're trying to resolve. \n\nHowever, whether the author is in the wrong depends on how they communicated the deadline. If it was a clear expectation and the girlfriend had prior knowledge, the author might not be wrong. But if the deadline was sudden, it could be harsh. Also, considering it's a long-distance relationship, communication challenges are common. The author is giving her a chance to fix it, which shows they're trying to be understanding. The girlfriend might need more support to come out rather than pressure. So, the author's stance is about wanting openness, which is reasonable, but the method of enforcing it with a deadline and potential breakup could be problematic. The right answer might be B (No), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting transparency, but there's room for both sides to communicate better.\n"
