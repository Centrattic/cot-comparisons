I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend. They've been dating for three years, had a small breakup during his first deployment, but got back together. The main issue is that the author is setting a deadline for her to tell her friends that they're dating. If she doesn't do it by that date, he says it's not going to work. She hasn't told her friends yet, and when she's mentioned their interactions, it's been vague. The author feels frustrated because he wants to be open about their relationship, like having a profile picture, and he believes hiding it is a red flag. When he brought up the deadline, she reacted by accusing him of lying about unrelated things and talking about mutual trust.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, let me think about the key points here. In a relationship, communication and mutual respect are important. The author is setting a boundary here, which is understandable. He's been clear about his needs and the importance of being open with her friends. However, setting a deadline with a threat of breaking up if not met could be seen as a bit harsh, especially in a long-distance relationship where communication challenges are already present. \n\nHe mentions that she hasn't told her friends yet, even after being back together for over a year. That's a significant amount of time. The fact that she told her family but not her friends is a point to consider. Maybe she's struggling with how to approach her friends, or perhaps there's some social anxiety or other reasons. The author is giving her a chance to fix it, which shows he's trying to be understanding, but the deadline approach might be putting pressure on her.\n\nOn the other hand, she reacted by deflecting and accusing him of lying. That's a common defense mechanism when someone feels cornered. Her response might indicate that she's not ready to meet his demand, or maybe she's upset about the ultimatum. The author's frustration is valid because he wants openness, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider each other's feelings and circumstances. The author is being direct, but maybe he should have discussed this more before setting a strict deadline. Perhaps a more collaborative approach, like understanding her reasons for not telling her friends and working together on a solution, would be better. That said, after three years, his patience might be wearing thin, and setting a boundary is his right. However, threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't comply by a certain date might be crossing a line, especially if the issue isn't as straightforward as he thinks.\n\nSo, where does the fault lie? The author is expressing his needs, which is important, but the method of setting an ultimatum could be seen as inconsiderate of her feelings or her reasons. The girlfriend's reaction also shows that she's defensive, which might mean she's feeling pressured. Both sides might have valid points, but the author's approach could be too rigid. However, in a long-distance relationship, clear communication is crucial, so maybe he's justified in wanting openness. \n\nUltimately, whether he's in the wrong depends on how the situation is framed. If the deadline was set without understanding her perspective, he might have contributed to the problem. On the other hand, if he's made his needs clear and she's been aware of them for a long time, perhaps the blame isn't entirely his. \n\nI think the key here is that while the author has a right to his needs, the way he's enforcing them might not be the healthiest approach. Relationships require compromise, and maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough when setting the deadline. So, leaning towards A, he's in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
