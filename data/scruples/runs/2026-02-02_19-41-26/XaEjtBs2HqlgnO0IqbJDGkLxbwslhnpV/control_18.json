I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been in a 3-year long-distance relationship. There was a breakup during a deployment, but they got back together. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, only her family. She's been vague about their relationship status with her friends, which the author finds unacceptable. He's set a deadline for her to come clean, and she reacted negatively, even turning the situation back on him.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication, trust, and boundaries. The author feels that after three years, it's time for her friends to know. He's frustrated because he wants to be open about their relationship and doesn't want her friends to get the wrong impression. On the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, and when confronted, she deflects by questioning his trust in her actions.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of a relationship, both partners should have the right to set boundaries. The author is trying to communicate his needs, which is healthy. However, setting a deadline with an ultimatum could be seen as pressure, especially if she's not ready. But given the length of the relationship and the fact that her friends don't know, there's a valid concern about transparency.\n\nThe girlfriend's approach of not disclosing their relationship status to her friends could be due to various reasons\u2014maybe she's insecure, unsure about the relationship, or has past issues. However, the author has valid reasons too, like wanting to be public and ensuring mutual trust.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author is being consistent by telling his friends, while she's not. This inconsistency might be a point of contention. However, the way he's handling it\u2014setting a strict deadline and potentially breaking up if she doesn't comply\u2014could be seen as harsh, but given the context, maybe it's a necessary step for him.\n\nIn relationships, it's about mutual respect and understanding. If one partner's needs aren't being met, it's reasonable to address it. The author is trying to resolve this after three years, which shows he's given her time. The girlfriend's defensive reaction suggests she might feel threatened or not ready, which could indicate deeper issues.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's communicated his needs, given her time, and now is setting a boundary. The problem might be more on the girlfriend's side for not being transparent, but the way he's handling the ultimatum could be seen as reasonable given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer would lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
