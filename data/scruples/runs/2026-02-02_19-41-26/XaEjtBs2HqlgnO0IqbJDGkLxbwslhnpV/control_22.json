I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is about whether setting a deadline for a girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. They've been dating for three years, had a breakup during a deployment, and got back together. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just said she's not dating anyone or gave vague answers. The author is setting a deadline for her to inform her friends, otherwise he might end the relationship. The girlfriend reacted negatively, accused him of lying about other things, and the author wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a relationship perspective, setting boundaries is normal. But when you're in a long-distance relationship, communication is key. The author feels frustrated because he wants his relationship to be public, and he's concerned about her friends not knowing. However, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not disclosing, maybe fear of her friends' reactions or past experiences.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and understanding. The author's frustration is valid if he feels the relationship needs to be acknowledged by her friends. But setting a strict deadline might come off as ultimatum-like, which can be perceived as controlling. On the other hand, the girlfriend's response of turning the situation back on him by accusing him of other issues might indicate defensiveness or insecurity.\n\nThe user wants a binary answer: A for yes, the author is wrong; B for no. Considering that both parties have valid points but the author is setting a boundary, which is his right, but how he communicated it might be the issue. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests there might be deeper issues, like trust or fear. The author's reasoning for wanting her friends to know is to avoid potential romantic interference, which is reasonable in a committed relationship. But the way he set the deadline and the girlfriend's defensive response could both be contributing to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to negotiate boundaries. The author isn't wrong for wanting honesty and openness, but he might be wrong if he's not considering her feelings and reasons. However, the girlfriend's solution of vague answers isn't sufficient for the author. The question is whether the author overstepped by giving a deadline. It's a judgment call. I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting a boundary based on his needs, but the way he communicated it could be improved. However, the girlfriend's reaction also points to possible underlying issues. Since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer might be B (not wrong) because he has the right to set his boundaries. But maybe A if the deadline is too harsh. I'm leaning towards B because it's about mutual respect and he's trying to address a legitimate concern.\n"
