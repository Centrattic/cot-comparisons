I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a 3-year long-distance relationship with a past breakup. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, only her family, and when she does mention him, it's vague. The author feels frustrated and sets a deadline, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication and boundaries in relationships. The author wants the girlfriend to be public about their relationship, which is understandable. But setting a deadline with a breakup threat if not met could be seen as ultimatum, which can be a sensitive issue. Ultimatums can strain relationships and might come off as controlling if not discussed with mutual understanding.\n\nThe girlfriend hasn't told her friends despite being back together for over a year. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach of giving a strict deadline and conditional continuation of the relationship might be problematic. It's important to consider why she hasn't told her friends. Maybe there are personal reasons like fear of judgment, past experiences, or uncertainty about the relationship's future. The author's insistence without understanding her perspective could be dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's response of deflecting by bringing up unrelated issues suggests she felt cornered or attacked. The author's approach might have been too confrontational. Healthy communication involves listening and addressing concerns rather than imposing deadlines without discussion. However, the author's desire for transparency is also valid, especially in a long-distance relationship where visibility might be a way to maintain connection and prevent misunderstandings.\n\nThe key points are: the length of the relationship, the importance of communication, the use of ultimatums, and mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate if they didn't have prior discussions about expectations. On the other hand, the girlfriend's secrecy could be affecting trust and the author's need for openness is understandable. Balancing these factors, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points but the author's method of addressing the issue could be the issue. So, leaning towards the author being partially in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more empathy and open dialogue.\n"
