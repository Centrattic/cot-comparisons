I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a 3-year long-distance relationship, including a breakup during deployment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just said she's not dating anyone but gives ambiguous answers when asked about him.\n\nThe author feels frustrated after a long time and wants transparency, so he sets a deadline. He's not just being controlling; he wants mutual trust and for her friends to know they're a couple. The girlfriend reacted by bringing up unrelated trust issues, which seems like a deflection.\n\nNow, considering long-distance relationships are tough. Communication is key. The author's request is about mutual honesty. It's reasonable to want his partner's friends to know they're together, especially since his are already aware. However, setting a deadline might come off as ultimatum-like, which could be seen as harsh. But given the 3 years and past issues, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of not disclosing their relationship status to friends, especially after the breakup, could be a red flag. The author isn't pressuring her to be public in a way that's uncomfortable, but wanting mutual acknowledgment. The response from her seems to shift blame instead of addressing the issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's expressing valid concerns about trust and transparency. While the deadline might be intense, it's in the context of a long-term relationship where both should be committed. The girlfriend's deflection and lack of action over 3 years might indicate a deeper issue. The author isn't being unreasonable; he's seeking equality in the relationship. So, I think the answer is B (No).\n"
