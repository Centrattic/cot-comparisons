I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the guy is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, threatening to break up if she doesn't. They've been together for three years with a past breakup, and she hasn't told her friends she's back with him. She's been vague about their relationship, which he finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy feels he's justified because he wants her friends to know they're dating, especially since his friends already know. He's frustrated after three years and wants her to be open. On the other hand, she might be dealing with personal reasons for keeping it private. Maybe she's concerned about how her friends will react, or she's not ready to make it public. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The guy sets a deadline and makes an ultimatum, which can be seen as controlling. Relationships require trust and flexibility. If she hasn't told her friends yet, maybe there's a valid reason that's not being communicated. But the guy's frustration is also valid because after three years, he wants more openness. \n\nHowever, setting a deadline with a breakup threat might be too harsh. Instead of an ultimatum, discussing the issue and finding a compromise might be better. The girlfriend's reaction of deflecting and accusing him of lying could indicate her stress or fear. \n\nIn long-distance relationships, communication is even more critical. The guy's approach might be seen as inflexible, expecting her to meet his needs without considering hers. But he's also open to change, which is a good trait. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, setting a deadline with a breakup threat is extreme. On the other, he's justified in wanting honesty. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think it leans towards yes because of the ultimatum and not allowing her time to explain her side. But maybe there's nuance. However, given the information, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
