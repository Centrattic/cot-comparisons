I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the author has been in a 3-year relationship with their girlfriend. The main issue is that the author is setting a deadline for the girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating, and when she doesn't meet it, he threatens to end the relationship. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends since they got back together after a breakup, and she's been vague about their relationship status.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels frustrated because they want their relationship to be public, especially since they can't be together in person. They mention their own friends know, so they expect reciprocity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be hesitant due to personal reasons\u2014maybe fear of judgment, past experiences, or just not being ready to share. The author is giving her a deadline, which can add pressure. When he confronts her, she responds by deflecting and bringing up unrelated trust issues, which might be her way of coping with the stress.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. He's setting boundaries, which is okay. But in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe he should have discussed this earlier instead of setting a strict deadline after three years. However, he mentions giving her another chance. On the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't been transparent, and the author has a right to feel insecure if her friends don't know their status. But the way he set the deadline without considering her feelings might be harsh. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt attacked, which could be valid if the approach was confrontational. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect, communication, and boundaries. The author wants transparency, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reluctance might have valid reasons, but she hasn't communicated that effectively. The author's approach could be seen as controlling if he's not allowing for her fears or reasons. However, setting a deadline after three years might be necessary for him to feel secure. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel heard. The author could have approached the topic more collaboratively, understanding her hesitations before setting a firm deadline. By doing that, maybe they could have found a middle ground. Instead, he gave an ultimatum, which can feel like a power move. The girlfriend's deflection also shows possible underlying issues in communication. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not being more understanding and for using an ultimatum without fully exploring her reasons. But there's also a valid point about the need for mutual commitment. However, the way he handled it could have been better. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because setting a strict deadline without considering her perspective and using a confrontational approach could be the main issue here.\n"
