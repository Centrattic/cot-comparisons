I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told his girlfriend she has a deadline to tell her friends they're dating, otherwise it won't work. They're in a long-distance relationship, 3 years together, had a breakup during a deployment but got back together. She hasn't told her friends, just said she told them she's not dating anyone, and when asked about the author, she says they talk. He wants her to be open with her friends, and when he set a deadline, she got upset and turned the argument on him.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics of long-distance relationships. It's harder because you can't be physically present, so communication and trust are key. The author feels that her friends not knowing they're dating is a problem. He wants her to be open, which is understandable. But setting a deadline and ultimatums can be a big deal. \n\nThe girlfriend's approach of saying she's not dating anyone might be her way of protecting her privacy, but the author sees it as hiding. Long-distance can make trust issues worse. The fact that he's open with his friends but she's not might create an imbalance. However, setting a deadline might come off as controlling. \n\nAlso, when he mentioned the deadline, she reacted by accusing him of lying about unrelated things. That could mean she felt attacked and is deflecting. But the author is frustrated because he wants her to be public about their relationship. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's trying to address a legitimate concern\u2014transparency in the relationship. But maybe the way he did it was harsh. Ultimatums can be stressful. On the other hand, she's been avoiding this for a long time. Maybe both have some responsibility. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points: long-distance, 3 years, she hasn't told her friends, he wants openness. He set a deadline, she reacted negatively. He's not the one hiding, he's trying to get her to be honest. But the deadline might be too rigid. However, it's his right to set boundaries. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
