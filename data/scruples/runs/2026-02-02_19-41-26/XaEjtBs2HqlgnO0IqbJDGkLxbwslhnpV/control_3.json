I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, including a breakup and getting back together. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just saying she's not dating anyone. The author wants her to make it clear they're dating so friends know not to hit on her. He set a deadline, and when he mentioned it, she got defensive and accused him of other things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in a relationship. The author is expressing a valid need for openness and commitment. In long-distance relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend hasn't been honest with her friends about their status, which could lead to misunderstandings or jealousy. The author's frustration is understandable because he wants mutual trust and recognition of their relationship by her social circle.\n\nHowever, setting a deadline might be seen as ultimatum-like, which could be stressful. But given the three-year duration and the long-distance aspect, the author's patience might be wearing thin. The girlfriend's response of deflecting and bringing up unrelated issues might indicate her discomfort with the conversation or her own insecurities. \n\nIt's important to note that both partners should have their needs addressed. The author wants his commitment to be acknowledged, while the girlfriend might have her reasons for not disclosing (maybe past experiences, fear of judgment, or family things). But the author isn't wrong for wanting transparency. The key here is whether setting a deadline is reasonable. Since they've been dating for three years and the issue hasn't been resolved, the author has a right to set boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his needs and setting a deadline for honest communication, especially in a long-term relationship where mutual trust and openness are crucial.\n"
