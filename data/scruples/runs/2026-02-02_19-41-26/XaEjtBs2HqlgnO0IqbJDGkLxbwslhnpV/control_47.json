I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, had a breakup during a deployment, and she hasn't told her friends they're back together. He's frustrated because he wants their relationship to be public, and she's been ambiguous with her friends. He set a deadline, and she reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, communication in long-distance relationships is crucial. The author feels his needs aren't being met, so he's setting boundaries. But maybe he's being too rigid? He mentions that her solution isn't sufficient, like saying she's not dating anyone. That could be a way for her to maintain some privacy or maybe she's not ready for that level of commitment. But he's given her three years to tell her friends, so is a deadline fair?\n\nHe wants to take pictures together and have a profile pic, which is understandable. But why hasn't she told her friends yet? Could there be valid reasons she hasn't shared? Maybe she's dealing with personal issues or her friends' reactions. However, the author is in a position where he feels the need for transparency because his friends know. It's a two-way street\u2014trust issues arise when one partner is open and the other isn't.\n\nWhen he set the deadline, she turned it into an accusation about trust. That's a red flag. Maybe she feels he's not respecting her boundaries. But the author's frustration is valid too. After three years and a breakup, he might be seeking closure or public validation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, setting a deadline could be seen as controlling. On the other, he's expressing his needs. The key is whether he communicated this deadline respectfully and gave her enough time. Since he's given her three years and she hasn't acted, maybe the deadline is a reasonable step. However, the way he presented it (with frustration) might have been harsh. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his needs, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
