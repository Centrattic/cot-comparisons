I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, with a past breakup and reconciliation. The main issue is the author setting a deadline for the girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating, and she's not happy about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Long-distance relationships can be tough, and communication is key. The author mentions that he wants her friends to know they're dating so there's no ambiguity, which he feels is necessary because he's been honest with his friends from the start. On the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends even after a year of being back together, which is causing frustration.\n\nThe author gives her a deadline, which he frames as a requirement for the relationship to work. She's taken aback and responds by deflecting to his trust issues, bringing up unrelated things like not knowing if he's going to parties. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details provided.\n\nIs setting a deadline for her to inform her friends about the relationship a reasonable request? Well, in relationships, boundaries and expectations are important. If someone is in a committed relationship, it's reasonable to want that commitment to be shared with friends. However, the way the deadline is presented might be problematic. Telling someone that the relationship won't work if they don't comply by a certain date could be seen as ultimatum-like, which might be harsh regardless of the reasoning.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is defensive. She hasn't told her friends yet, perhaps due to personal reasons or fear of judgment. The author's frustration is valid because he wants transparency, but using a deadline as a means to enforce that could be seen as putting pressure. Also, her deflecting to his trust issues might indicate underlying trust problems in the relationship, which the author hasn't addressed but instead focused on the communication with friends.\n\nAnother angle: in a long-distance relationship, control and trust are delicate. The author wants his needs met (friends knowing they're dating), but the girlfriend might feel that the deadline is imposing his will without considering her feelings or reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's anxious about how her friends will react, or she's not emotionally ready. The author's approach might not be the most supportive.\n\nHowever, the author is trying to maintain a healthy relationship by setting boundaries. If the girlfriend can't meet these expectations, maybe it's a valid concern. But is the deadline the right approach? It might be more constructive to have an open conversation about the importance of transparency and work together to find a solution rather than setting a strict deadline. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method he used could be seen as ultimatum-like, hence possibly inconsiderate.\n\nIn summary, while the author's desire for openness is reasonable, the way he's addressing it by setting a deadline might be where he's in the wrong. Relationships require compromise and understanding, and using a deadline as a condition could be seen as pressuring her rather than supporting her through the process. The girlfriend's deflection also points to possible trust issues that the author might need to address, but the immediate issue is about communication with friends. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the ultimatum approach rather than collaborative problem-solving.\n"
