I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship after three years, with a past breakup during a deployment. The main issue is the author setting a deadline for the girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is frustrated because the girlfriend hasn't informed her friends about their relationship, even though he's public about it. He's given her a deadline, and she reacted negatively. The girlfriend's response was to deflect by bringing up unrelated trust issues. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, setting a deadline might be a way to express the importance he places on transparency. However, in a long-distance relationship, trust is crucial. The girlfriend might feel that he's not respecting her boundaries or the reasons why she hasn't told her friends yet. Maybe she's dealing with personal issues or fears, especially since she already had to inform her family, which might have been difficult. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, especially since it's been three years and he wants to be open about their relationship. But by setting a strict deadline, he might be pressuring her without fully understanding her perspective. The girlfriend's reaction, attacking him with unrelated issues, suggests defensiveness, which can happen when someone feels cornered.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends already know, so there's inconsistency in how the relationship is being presented. The girlfriend's friends not knowing might lead to awkward situations or potential issues if they meet. The author's concern about her friends possibly pursuing her is valid in a way, but that's his own worry, not hers. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The author might not be wrong in wanting transparency, but the way he set the deadline without considering her feelings could be problematic. It's possible he should have discussed it more and reached a mutual understanding rather than imposing a deadline. The girlfriend's reaction, while unproductive, doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong, but his approach might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's expressing his needs, which is important, but the method might have been too abrupt. However, given the context of the relationship's length and his consistent public stance, it's not entirely his fault. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he communicated his expectations.\n"
