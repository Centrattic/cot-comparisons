I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the author is setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The girlfriend didn't do that, and now the author is giving her an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a long-distance relationship. Communication is key, and maybe the girlfriend has her reasons for not telling her friends yet. The author mentions they've been dating for three years, with a breakup and getting back together. The girlfriend told her family but not her friends, and she's been vague about their relationship status when her friends ask. The author feels frustrated and wants to take public actions like a profile picture to show they're a couple, which the girlfriend hasn't agreed to.\n\nThe author set a deadline, and the girlfriend reacted negatively, deflecting by accusing the author of lies. The author wants to give it another chance but is firm on the deadline.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is expressing their need for the relationship to be public, which is understandable. On the other hand, setting an ultimatum might be too harsh, especially in a long-distance situation where the girlfriend might have valid reasons for not wanting to disclose yet. The girlfriend's deflection could indicate her discomfort with the pressure.\n\nHowever, relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If the girlfriend hasn't communicated her reasons for not telling her friends, the author is left in the dark. But setting a deadline and threatening to end the relationship if it's not met might be seen as extreme, especially after three years. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach might be too abrupt without addressing underlying issues.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend isn't being transparent enough. If the author feels the need for public acknowledgment, and the girlfriend hasn't provided a timeline or explanation, then the author's stance could be justified. But the way it's handled\u2014using an ultimatum and causing immediate conflict\u2014might be problematic.\n\nConsidering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been more collaborative. However, the girlfriend's lack of communication is also an issue. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or personal boundaries. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're asserting their needs, but the method could be better. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. The deadline and ultimatum could be seen as too harsh, so maybe A (Yes). Hmm.\n"
