I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years. They had a breakup during his deployment but got back together. Now, he's setting a deadline for her to tell her friends they're dating, and if she can't do that by a certain date, he thinks it might not work. She didn't tell her friends during their breakup, and even now, she's only saying things like \"I saw him, we talked\" instead of being open. He wants to take pictures and have a profile picture to show they're together, but she's been hiding it. When he brings it up, she turns it around and accuses him of lying about other things.\n\nHmm. First, communication is key in any relationship, especially long-distance. He's frustrated because he wants their relationship to be public, which is understandable. Maybe he feels that hiding the relationship is a red flag. But does he have the right to set a deadline? Well, it's his relationship, so he's allowed to have boundaries. However, setting a hard deadline might come off as ultimatum, which can be harsh. \n\nShe hasn't told her friends for over a year since they got back together. That's a long time. He's been patient for three years, but maybe he's reached a breaking point. His frustration is valid because he wants to be open about their relationship. On the other hand, she might have her reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's anxious, or there's something else going on that he's not considering. \n\nWhen he sets the deadline, she reacts by accusing him of lying about other unrelated things. That's a classic deflection tactic. It's possible she's feeling attacked or insecure, so she's shifting the blame. But that doesn't make his approach right. Maybe he should have approached the conversation with more empathy instead of setting a strict deadline. \n\nThe fact that all his friends know they're dating adds to his perspective. It's asymmetric, so maybe he feels it's unfair that she's hiding it. But he needs to consider her feelings and reasons. Maybe she's not ready, or maybe there's a cultural or personal reason she's hesitant. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his needs, which is important, but the way he's doing it by setting a strict deadline might not be the best approach. However, he's not entirely wrong to want the relationship to be public. It's a matter of communication style and mutual respect. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think it's a bit of both. But since the options are A for yes and B for no, I need to pick one. \n\nIn situations like this, it's often a matter of perspective. He's not wrong for having his needs, but maybe he could have handled it better. Since the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong, and he's stating his case, I think the answer is B, No, because he's not entirely wrong. However, some might argue that setting a deadline without understanding her perspective is wrong. But given the context, I think B is more accurate.\n"
