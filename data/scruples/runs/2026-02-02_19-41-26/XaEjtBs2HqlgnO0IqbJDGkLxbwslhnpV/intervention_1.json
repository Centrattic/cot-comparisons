I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about setting a deadline for the girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The couple has been in a long-distance relationship for three years, with a previous breakup during a deployment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just said she's not dating anyone or made vague mentions. The author set a deadline, and when she didn't meet it, he threatened to end the relationship. The girlfriend reacted by accusing him of lying about unrelated things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Long-distance relationships already have challenges, and communication is key. The author feels it's important for her friends to know they're dating, maybe to feel validated or to prevent others from pursuing her. But the girlfriend hasn't shared this, which is causing frustration. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for setting a deadline? Relationships often require mutual respect and understanding of each other's boundaries. The author might believe that transparency is necessary, but the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not telling her friends yet\u2014maybe they don't know each other's statuses, or there's something else going on. \n\nSetting a deadline can be seen as a way to communicate needs, but it's important to ensure that both partners are on the same page. The author's approach might be a bit ultimatum-like, which can be stressful. However, after three years, he's justified in wanting resolution. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she might feel cornered or that her autonomy is being questioned. She might not see the same urgency or might have valid reasons for her hesitation. The author's frustration is understandable, but demanding a specific action without understanding her perspective could be part of the problem.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's accusation about unrelated things might indicate defensiveness or that she feels unfairly targeted. The author's approach might have been too harsh or not communicative enough. Maybe he didn't discuss the reasons behind his need for her to tell her friends, leading to misunderstanding.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal needs with the partner's comfort. The author's requirement for public acknowledgment might be a deal-breaker for him, but if it's not something the girlfriend can handle, it could indeed be a problem. However, giving her time to fix it shows he's trying to be accommodating.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he communicated his needs clearly but not in a way that's respectful of her boundaries, maybe. But if he's been patient and now setting a deadline is a final attempt, it might be justified. The key is whether the deadline was reasonable and if both felt heard. The girlfriend's defensive response complicates things. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author might not be entirely wrong, but his approach could be improved. However, considering the girlfriend's actions and the situation, maybe the author is in the right to have limits. But the way he handled it might be part of the issue. Hmm. I'm leaning towards No (B) because he's trying to communicate his needs, but it's a nuanced situation where both could have handled it better. However, the girlfriend's actions (hiding the relationship) might be the main issue here.\n"
