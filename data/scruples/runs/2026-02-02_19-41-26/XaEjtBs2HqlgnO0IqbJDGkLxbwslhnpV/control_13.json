I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship that's been going for three years. The key issue is the author setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of long-distance relationships. They often require a lot of trust and communication. The author mentions that after reuniting post-breakup, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together. She's been vague, just saying she talks to him when he visits. The author feels this is dishonest and wants her friends to know for transparency, especially since his friends already know. He sets a deadline, and when she reacts negatively, he feels frustrated.\n\nNow, the author's actions: setting a deadline can be seen as a firm boundary. He's communicated his need for mutual trust and transparency. However, the girlfriend's response was defensive, bringing up unrelated trust issues. That complicates things. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, setting a deadline for disclosure isn't inherently wrong if both parties have discussed it. However, the girlfriend's reluctance might stem from personal reasons, like fear of judgment or past experiences. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of setting a concrete deadline without understanding her perspective could be problematic. Also, the girlfriend's deflection by bringing up other trust issues might indicate deeper problems in the relationship that the author hasn't addressed yet.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to establish trust and openness, which are healthy in a relationship. His friends knowing and hers not might create an imbalance. But the way he enforced the deadline without considering her feelings or reasons could be the issue here. \n\nSo, the question is whether his approach was too abrupt. If they had discussed this before, maybe the deadline is justified. But if it was a sudden demand, it might lack empathy. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt cornered, which could mean the author didn't handle it well. \n\nIn conclusion, both parties have valid points. The author isn't entirely in the wrong for wanting transparency, but his approach might have been too harsh. The girlfriend's hesitation isn't necessarily a deal-breaker but indicates possible underlying issues. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer might lean towards B (No), as the author is advocating for mutual trust, which is reasonable, but he needs to approach it with more empathy. But considering the girlfriend's reaction and possible reasons, maybe A (Yes) if his method was ultimatum-like without understanding her side. Hmm, tricky. The key is that relationships require mutual understanding. If the author didn't discuss this thoroughly and just set a deadline, he could be in the wrong. But if they had previous discussions and this was a reasonable boundary, then B. The post doesn't mention prior discussions, so maybe the author was too abrupt. So, leaning towards A (Yes), he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings and forcing an ultimatum without addressing her concerns first.\n"
