I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for 3 years, had a breakup during his deployment, and she hasn't told her friends since they got back together. He's frustrated because she's been vague, and he wants her friends to know so there's clarity. He gave her a deadline, and she reacted negatively, turning the issue back on him.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author felt the need to set a boundary because he values transparency. It's understandable given the long-distance aspect and the time they've been together. However, setting a deadline might come off as ultimatum-like, which can create pressure. But considering the context of 3 years, it's also reasonable to expect some level of commitment in communication.\n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, hasn't told her friends despite the time they've been together. Her explanation is that she's told them she's not dating anyone, but that's not the same as being open about the relationship. The author's friends know, so there's an imbalance. The fact that she turned the issue back on him by accusing him of lying might indicate defensiveness, which could be a red flag for not taking responsibility.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because he wants mutual trust and openness. However, the way he communicated his deadline might have been abrupt. It's possible he should have discussed this concern earlier rather than setting a hard deadline. But given the time they've been together and the lack of progress, his stance isn't entirely unreasonable. The key points are mutual respect and understanding, but since both have valid points, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the author's intention is to encourage transparency, which is healthy, even if the method could be improved.\n"
