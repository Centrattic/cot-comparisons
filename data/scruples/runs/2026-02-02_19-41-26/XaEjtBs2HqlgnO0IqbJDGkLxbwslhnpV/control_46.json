I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is in a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been dating for three years. There was a breakup during his deployment, but they got back together. The issue is that his girlfriend hasn't told her friends that they're back together. She told her family, but not her friends, and when she does interact with them, she just says things like \"I saw him, we talked\" or claims she's not dating anyone. The author feels that after three years, this is unacceptable. He gave her a deadline to tell her friends, and if she doesn't, he's considering ending the relationship. His girlfriend was taken aback, got frustrated, and didn't reciprocate \"I love you\" statements after that. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The relationship has been going on for three years, which is a significant amount of time. The girlfriend has told her family but not her friends. The author is frustrated because he can't be open with her friends, which affects things like profile pictures and social interactions. He gave her a deadline, which is a clear ultimatum. The girlfriend's response was defensive, bringing up unrelated issues and accusing him of not being truthful. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author is expressing his feelings about the situation and setting boundaries. He's not happy with the lack of openness from his girlfriend and has given her a specific deadline. However, ultimatums can be a sensitive topic. On one hand, he's trying to set clear expectations; on the other hand, setting a deadline to end the relationship if the condition isn't met could be seen as extreme, especially after three years.\n\nBut wait, there's a key difference mentioned: the author's friends know they're dating, but her friends don't. The girlfriend's behavior might be causing confusion or insecurity for the author. He wants her to be as open with her friends as he is with his. The girlfriend's approach of saying she's not dating anyone or giving vague answers isn't satisfying the author's need for openness. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not telling her friends yet. Maybe she's uncomfortable, or there are dynamics in her friend group that make her hesitant. The author's frustration is valid in the sense that relationships often require both partners to be open and honest with their social circles. But setting a hard deadline could be seen as putting pressure on her, especially if she's not ready. \n\nThe author's approach of giving a deadline to end the relationship if the condition isn't met is a form of ultimatum, which can be a red flag if it's used without considering the other person's perspective. It's important to have open communication and try to understand each other's feelings. If the girlfriend hasn't told her friends after three years, there might be underlying issues that need to be addressed beyond just the deadline. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that after three years, it's reasonable to expect her to be open. The fact that she's been inconsistent (saying she's not dating anyone) might be causing him distress. The girlfriend's defensive reaction suggests that she might feel attacked, which could be valid if the ultimatum was delivered without discussing her feelings first. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's intention is to set a boundary due to his feelings of insecurity and the need for mutual openness. However, the way he delivered it as a hard deadline might be inconsiderate of her feelings and her reasons. It's possible that he's not in the wrong because he's expressing his needs, but the method could be problematic. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong for giving an ultimatum without fully understanding her perspective. \n\nThe community's response to these types of situations often values communication and compromise. If the author hasn't discussed the issue thoroughly with her before setting the deadline, that could be where he's at fault. Relationships require both parties to work through issues together, not just impose conditions. However, if she's been resistant to addressing the issue for a long time, the author might feel justified in setting a boundary for himself. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a nuanced situation. The author has a valid point about wanting his relationship to be open with her friends, but the way he's handling it could be seen as harsh. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he approached her with empathy and understanding before setting the deadline. If he did, maybe not. If he didn't, then perhaps he is. Since the story mentions he's given her a chance to fix it over three years, but this is the first time he's set a deadline, it's possible he's acted in the wrong by not addressing it earlier or being more supportive in helping her come to terms with it.\n"
