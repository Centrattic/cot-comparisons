I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, including a breakup during a deployment. The author wants their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a specific deadline, or else it won't work. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, even after getting back together. Her solution is vague, like saying she's not dating anyone or that they just talked. The author is frustrated because he wants to be public about their relationship, take pictures, etc., and he's given her a deadline. She reacted negatively, turning it into an accusation about trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a long-distance relationship. Trust and communication are crucial. The author has given her a timeline, which might be a way to address his frustration. But is setting a deadline reasonable? It depends on their agreement. If they had a previous understanding about telling friends, and she hasn't met it despite multiple chances, maybe the author is justified. However, three years is a long time, and maybe he's being too strict. On the other hand, her not informing her friends could be a red flag. Why hide the relationship? It could indicate insecurity, lack of commitment, or other issues. The author wants his relationship to be public, which is valid if that's important to him. But does he have the right to set a hard deadline? Relationships require mutual effort and compromise. If she's resistant to publicizing their relationship after three years, maybe there's an underlying issue. The author's frustration is understandable, but setting a deadline might be a bit controlling. However, if he's communicated his needs and she hasn't addressed them, he's within his rights to set boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014accusing him of unrelated issues\u2014might be a defense mechanism. Overall, it's a tough call. The author might be in the right if he's been clear and given her time, but if he's being rigid without considering her reasons, maybe he's part of the problem. I think it's a balance between his need for openness and her reasons for not disclosing. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I might lean towards A because setting a strict deadline could be seen as ultimatum, which might be unfair unless all bases were covered. But if she's had multiple chances and he's been patient, maybe B. Hmm. I need to decide based on the info given. The answer is probably A because the deadline is a hard requirement, which might be pushing too much without understanding her perspective. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, he's justified in seeking commitment and transparency. Maybe B.\n"
