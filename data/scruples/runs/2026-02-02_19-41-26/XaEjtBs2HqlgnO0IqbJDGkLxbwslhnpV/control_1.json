I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together.

She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been dating for three years. There was a breakup during his first deployment, but they reconciled. The main issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends that they're back together. She told her family, but her friends still don't know. The author is frustrated because he wants her to be open about their relationship with her friends. He set a deadline for her to tell her friends, and if she doesn't, he thinks it's not going to work. After he told her this, she reacted by accusing him of lying about other things, instead of addressing the issue directly.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the relationship is long-distance, which can be tough already. Communication is key in such situations. The author wants public displays of the relationship, like a profile picture and being open with friends. That makes sense because if you're in a relationship, you usually share that with others. But the girlfriend hasn't told her friends she's dating him. She says she told them she's not dating anyone, but when they ask about the author, she says they talked. That's a bit confusing. Is she hiding their relationship? That could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author is setting a boundary here: if she can't tell her friends by a certain date, he thinks the relationship won't work. Is that fair? Well, boundaries are important in relationships. If the author feels that his partner isn't being open about their relationship with friends, it's reasonable for him to express that. However, the way he communicated this might be an issue. He mentions getting short or frustrated, which could have made her defensive. Also, she turned the conversation into an accusation about other unrelated things, which is a classic deflection.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's reasoning: she might have her own reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's private, or there's something else going on. The author is giving her a chance to fix this after three years, which seems mature. But he also feels that there's no reason to hide unless there's something to hide. That's a common sentiment in relationships\u2014transparency is important. However, everyone has different comfort levels with publicizing their relationship. Maybe the girlfriend isn't ready for that step, or she's dealing with personal issues.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author is setting a boundary, which is okay, but he needs to consider her perspective. Conversely, she needs to address his concerns instead of deflecting. The fact that she accused him of unrelated things suggests she might be avoiding the real issue. The author's frustration is valid if he feels that transparency is a core value in the relationship. But setting a deadline might come off as ultimatum, which can be stressful. However, in some cases, setting a deadline is necessary if one partner isn't making progress on an important issue.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he's communicating his needs, which is important. But maybe he could have approached it differently, with more empathy. However, given that the relationship is long-distance, his need for openness might be more pronounced to maintain a sense of legitimacy in their relationship to others. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction shows that she's not handling the situation well, which could indicate that she's not fully committed or has unresolved issues.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's expressing his needs and setting boundaries. However, the way he communicated it might have been harsh. The girlfriend's deflection suggests she's not addressing the core issue, which is problematic. But the question is specifically about the author. Since he's trying to communicate his needs and has given her time to adjust, he's in a reasonable position. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
