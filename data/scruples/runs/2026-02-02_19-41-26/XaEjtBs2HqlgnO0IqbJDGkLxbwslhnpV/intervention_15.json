I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author wants their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, otherwise they won't work. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet and is giving vague answers when her friends ask. The author is frustrated and sets a deadline, which leads to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been dating for three years with a break-up in between. The girlfriend already told her family but not her friends. The author's friends all know they're together, which is a point the author emphasizes. The author wants to take pictures and have a profile picture, which is a common way people show their relationships. The girlfriend's response to the deadline seems defensive, and she turned the conversation to the author's trust issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is setting a boundary, which is understandable in a relationship where both partners want mutual commitment. However, setting a deadline could be seen as demanding, especially in a long-distance situation where communication might be tricky. The girlfriend might feel pressured, especially after three years, which the author mentions as a reason to give her more time. But the author is also concerned about privacy and potential issues if friends don't know they're in a relationship.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for wanting their relationship to be public. On the other hand, setting a strict deadline might be too much, especially if the girlfriend has her own reasons for not revealing it yet. The key points are mutual respect, communication, and understanding each other's needs. The author's frustration is valid, but the way they approached it might have come off as ultimatum-like, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might indicate that she feels the author isn't respecting her boundaries or her reasons for not telling her friends. However, the author's own transparency (friends knowing) is a point in their favor. The problem is whether the deadline is a fair expectation. In some relationships, transparency is important, so the author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting that. But the method of enforcing it might be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the long-distance aspect. In such relationships, communication can be more challenging, and the girlfriend might have valid reasons for not wanting to tell her friends yet. The author's demand for a deadline could be seen as not accommodating the girlfriend's comfort level unless there's a clear reason for the secrecy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has legitimate concerns about transparency, the way they've set a deadline and the ultimatum might be too rigid. The girlfriend's right to privacy and personal boundaries should be respected. The author might benefit from discussing the importance of this issue with the girlfriend and finding a compromise rather than setting a strict deadline. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's perspective and not being flexible. So, Answer A.\n"
