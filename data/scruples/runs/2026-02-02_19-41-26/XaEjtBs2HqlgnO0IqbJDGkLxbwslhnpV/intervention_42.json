I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the author sets a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The girlfriend didn't tell her friends after getting back together, and now he's giving her an ultimatum. She reacted negatively, and he's unsure if he's the one at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They've been in a 3-year relationship with a past breakup due to deployment. The girl didn't inform her friends about their reconciliation, and now the author is setting a deadline. He wants to take pictures and have a public profile picture, which is important to him. When he brings up the deadline, she gets defensive and shifts blame to his possible lies. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants the opinion.\n\nThe main issue here is about setting boundaries in a relationship. The author feels that not being able to go public after three years is a red flag. On the other hand, the girlfriend might be hesitant to tell her friends for reasons like fear of judgment, past experiences, or personal privacy. The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate his needs, which is valid. However, giving an ultimatum might come off as controlling, especially in a long-distance situation where trust is already a challenge. The girlfriend's reaction could indicate that she's uncomfortable with the pressure, leading to a defensive response. \n\nBut the author also has valid concerns. Being in a relationship for three years and not being able to introduce each other publicly might suggest incompatibility. The fact that the author's friends know their relationship status is a contrast, which the author points out. It's about mutual respect and expectations. \n\nFrom a relational perspective, setting boundaries is okay, but the way it's communicated matters. If the author presented his feelings and the importance of public acknowledgment without ultimatums, maybe the outcome would be different. However, the ultimatum itself isn't inherently wrong if it's a dealbreaker for the author. \n\nThe girlfriend's refusal to disclose their relationship status might stem from personal issues, but if that's a dealbreaker for the author, he's justified in addressing it. However, the way he did it might have been abrupt. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's expressing his needs, but the method could be questioned. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's standing up for his needs and expectations, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the deadline is too strict without understanding her perspective, it's A (Yes). \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, so I need to see if that aligns. The user's reasoning isn't provided, but they might think the author is being too controlling. However, in relationships, partners do have the right to set boundaries. Given that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his needs, even if the approach could be improved. So the answer might be B.\n"
