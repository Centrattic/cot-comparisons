I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a 3-year long-distance relationship, had a brief breakup during a deployment, and she hasn't told her friends they're back together. The author is frustrated because her current approach\u2014saying she's not dating anyone but giving hints\u2014doesn't satisfy him. He sets a deadline, and she reacts negatively, bringing up unrelated issues about trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Long-distance relationships can be tough, especially when there's a lack of communication. The author wants his girlfriend's friends to know they're dating, which is reasonable. But setting a deadline with the threat of breaking up if it doesn't happen might be too abrupt. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, possibly due to her own reasons or insecurities. The author's frustration is valid, but how he communicates it matters. \n\nHe mentions that he wants to take pictures and have a profile picture, implying he wants public acknowledgment. His friends already know, so there's a discrepancy in their social circles. The girlfriend's response to turn the issue into a trust problem about him lying or going to parties might be a deflection, but it shows she feels accused. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is okay, but the way he enforces them could be an issue. He gives her a deadline and threatens to end things if she doesn't meet it. That's a significant ultimatum. However, he's given her time (over a year since they got back together) and is trying to resolve the issue. On the other hand, she might have valid reasons for not wanting to tell her friends yet, like fear of judgment or personal issues. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's approach is fair. Ultimatums can be valid if both parties agree, but in this case, he's unilaterally setting one without considering her perspective. His frustration is understandable, but the method of confronting her might have been too harsh, leading to her defensive reaction. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of her feelings and reasons. He might be in the wrong for not being more understanding and for using an ultimatum instead of finding a compromise. However, his desire for honesty and public acknowledgment is reasonable. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs and communication styles. But given the situation, I think the author's approach was too rigid, making him at least partially at fault. So, the answer is A.\n"
