I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, with a past breakup. The main issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together. The author sets a deadline for her to tell her friends, and when he does, she reacts negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels frustrated because he wants his relationship to be public. It's a long-distance, so maybe openness is important for trust. He mentions that his friends know they're dating, which is a key difference. He wants to take pictures and have a profile picture, which makes sense for a couple, especially long-distance. The deadline he set is a clear boundary, which is reasonable if both partners agree. But he didn't mention discussing this boundary beforehand, which might be where the problem lies.\n\nThe girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet. She told her family but not friends. Her solution of saying she's not dating anyone or only that they talked doesn't satisfy him. Her reaction\u2014turning it on him by accusing him of lying\u2014might indicate she feels defensive or untrustworthy. But why hasn't she told her friends? Maybe there's a reason she hasn't shared yet. Maybe her friends are a sensitive topic, or she has other personal reasons. \n\nThe author's frustration is valid because in a long-term relationship, especially with public presence, transparency can be important. However, setting a deadline without prior discussion might come off as ultimatum-like. The fact that she reacted with accusations suggests that maybe there's unresolved tension or that the way he communicated the deadline was harsh. \n\nAlso, considering the long-distance aspect, communication challenges are common. The author wants to show commitment publicly, which is understandable, but he needs to respect her boundaries. If she hasn't told her friends yet, maybe she's not ready. The key question is whether the author's demand for a deadline was communicated and negotiated before, or if he imposed it suddenly. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important for both partners. If the author felt the need to set a deadline, he should have had an open conversation earlier to understand her reasons and come to a mutual agreement. Setting a deadline without discussing it first might be seen as controlling or not considering her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response was to deflect and accuse him, which isn't constructive. She might be in the wrong for not being transparent and for not communicating her reasons. However, the author's approach to setting a deadline without prior discussion could also be problematic. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting transparency, but his method of setting a deadline without prior communication could be where he's wrong. Conversely, the girlfriend's reaction is also not ideal. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong. If he set a deadline without discussing it first, that's a problem. However, if he had tried to talk about it before and she didn't take it seriously, then setting a deadline could be justified. The scenario doesn't mention previous discussions, so it's possible the author acted unilaterally. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to navigate these issues together. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach might have been too abrupt. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong if he didn't communicate his needs earlier and just set a deadline. But if he had tried to discuss it and she wasn't responsive, then maybe it's not his fault. The scenario doesn't specify prior attempts, so it's ambiguous. However, based on the information given, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong for not discussing it first and imposing a deadline without mutual agreement.\n"
