I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author has set a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The girlfriend is hesitant, and when the author brought up the issue, she reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for three years, including a breakup during a deployment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just her family. The author wants transparency because he wants to be open about the relationship, especially given that he's already public with his friends. He set a deadline, and when she didn't meet it, he gave her an ultimatum. She reacted poorly, turning the conversation towards his trust issues.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. In long-distance relationships, communication and trust are crucial. The author feels that not being public with friends is a red flag. He has a valid point because mutual understanding and transparency are important. However, setting a strict deadline could be seen as ultimatums, which can be problematic. But the girlfriend hasn't told her friends, which might indicate her hesitation or maybe different priorities or fears. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of deflecting by bringing up his potential lies shows a possible lack of communication or trust on her side. However, the author's demand for a deadline might be reasonable if he needs the relationship to be public for his own security and comfort. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, demanding a specific deadline can come off as controlling. However, given the context of a long-distance relationship and the time span, the author's frustration is understandable. The key is whether setting a deadline is reasonable. Some might argue that relationships require compromise, and not being able to meet the girlfriend's friends is a significant issue. Others might say the author is being too rigid.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions (telling her friends they broke up but not that they're back together) might have contributed to the problem. The author's need for openness is valid, but the way he approached it could be seen as harsh. However, given the time frame and the importance of mutual trust, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether setting a deadline is a reasonable expectation. If the relationship requires both parties to be open with their social circles, then the author's stance makes sense. But if the girlfriend has legitimate reasons for not being public, the author might be overstepping. Since the post is from the author's perspective, and the girlfriend isn't meeting his needs for transparency, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. However, the method of setting a strict deadline could be seen as problematic. But given the context, maybe B is the answer.\n"
