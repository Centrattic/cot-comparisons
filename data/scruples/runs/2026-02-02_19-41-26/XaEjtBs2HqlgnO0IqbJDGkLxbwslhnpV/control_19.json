I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person has been in a 3-year long-distance relationship with their girlfriend. The main issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together after a brief breakup during a deployment. The author sets a deadline for her to inform her friends, otherwise they think it won't work. The girlfriend didn't react well, got short with him, and accused him of lying about unrelated things.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author wants transparency because their friends know about the relationship. They want the girlfriend's friends to know as well, especially to prevent her friends from pursuing her. The girlfriend is hiding the relationship from her friends, even saying she's not dating anyone. The author feels this is a problem and sets a deadline, which causes conflict.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms and communication. It's a long-distance relationship, which can be more challenging. The author's frustration is understandable because they want mutual recognition and integration into each other's social circles. However, setting a deadline with potential consequences (like breaking up) might be seen as ultimatums, which are often considered hurtful. The girlfriend's hesitation might stem from past issues or fear of judgment, especially since she already told her friends they broke up but not that they reconciled. The author might not be considering her feelings or reasons behind her reluctance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing their needs clearly, which is important in relationships. They want honesty and openness, which are valid. But using a deadline with a breakup threat could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend's reaction includes deflecting and accusing him of lies, which isn't helpful either. Both sides have valid points but are handling communication poorly.\n\nThe key question is whether setting a deadline for her to inform her friends is reasonable. It's about balancing personal needs with respecting the other's boundaries. The author has the right to want their relationship acknowledged, but the method of imposing a deadline without understanding her concerns might be inflexible. The girlfriend's refusal could be due to personal reasons not mentioned, like fear of backlash from friends or past experiences.\n\nIn summary, neither party is entirely right. However, the author's approach might be too rigid, while the girlfriend isn't addressing the issue adequately. But since the question is if the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, ultimatums are often seen negatively unless there's mutual agreement. The girlfriend's actions are withholding information, which the author finds unacceptable. Given that the author is trying to communicate their needs and the girlfriend isn't meeting them, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have valid concerns about transparency. But the method could be improved. However, the options are A (Yes) or B (No). Given that the author is setting a deadline and facing a defensive response, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a bit of a gray area.\n"
