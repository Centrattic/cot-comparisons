I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, with a breakup and reconciliation during a deployment. The key issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, and the author is setting a deadline for her to do so, threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't meet it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of long-distance relationships. Communication is crucial, and trust is a big factor. The author wants their relationship to be public, which is understandable for validation and to prevent misunderstandings. However, imposing a deadline with the threat of breaking up might be seen as ultimatum-like. Ultimatums can be damaging in relationships because they leave little room for discussion and can create pressure.\n\nThe girlfriend's side is that she hasn't told her friends even after being back together for over a year. She tells them she's not dating anyone, but when asked about the author, she mentions they've talked. That's a middle ground but not a clear statement of being in a relationship. The author feels that this isn't sufficient and wants her friends to know for clarity. The girlfriend's response was defensive, bringing up unrelated issues, which might indicate she's uncomfortable with the pressure.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to be open about their relationship, which is valid. However, setting a strict deadline with a breakup threat could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend might have personal reasons for not disclosing their relationship, such as fear of judgment, past experiences, or privacy concerns. The author hasn't considered these reasons and instead is pushing for a solution without dialogue.\n\nThe fact that the author's friends know about the relationship is a key point. The author might feel it's unfair that they're being open while the girlfriend isn't. But relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries and comfort levels. The girlfriend might be in her own head about this, and the author's approach might be forcing her into a position where she feels cornered.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-distance ones, compromise is essential. The author could have approached this by discussing the importance of being public about their relationship and working together to find a solution that respects both their needs. Instead, setting a deadline with a breakup threat could be seen as taking the high road without understanding the complexities of the situation.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's defensive reaction suggests that the author's approach might have been confrontational rather than collaborative. Healthy communication involves listening to each other's concerns rather than issuing ultimatums. The author might be projecting their own need for validation onto the girlfriend without fully considering her perspective.\n\nSo, while the author has valid feelings about wanting their relationship to be recognized, the method they're using to address the issue could be the problem. Ultimatums often lead to resentment and can cause the other person to feel attacked. The author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate of the girlfriend's reasons for not disclosing their relationship, thus making them at fault for not approaching the situation with more empathy and open dialogue.\n"
