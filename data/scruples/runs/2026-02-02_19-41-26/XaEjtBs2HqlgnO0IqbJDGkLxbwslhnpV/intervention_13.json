I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The situation is a long-distance relationship that's been going for three years with a previous breakup during a deployment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, and the author is frustrated, setting a deadline for her to do so. He's open to being convinced he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple has been together for three years, which is a significant amount of time. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, only mentioning the breakup but not the reconciliation. The author is setting a deadline, which the girlfriend seems to have reacted negatively to. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he wants his relationship to be public, at least to her friends, so they don't date others. He mentions that all his friends know about them, which is a key difference. He's frustrated because he wants to take pictures and have a profile picture, indicating a desire for openness. The deadline he set is a way to address his needs and expectations in the relationship. However, setting a strict deadline could be seen as ultimatum-like, which might pressure the girlfriend and create conflict.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she hasn't told her friends yet, despite being back together for over a year. Her solution of saying she's not dating anyone or vague mentions might not be sufficient for the author. However, people have different comfort levels with sharing personal relationships. Maybe she has reasons for not telling her friends\u2014like fear of their reaction, personal issues, or not feeling ready. The author's reaction might not consider her feelings or her reasons, leading to her feeling accused and defensive, as she turned the conversation to trust issues.\n\nThe long-distance aspect might also play a role. Long-distance relationships can be challenging, and sometimes people hold onto the past breakup, making them hesitant to commit publicly again. The girlfriend's past behavior (telling friends they split but not that they're back together) might make the author feel insecure or untrusting, but he's also setting a condition that might not account for her emotional state or her reasons for not sharing.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, possibly because he's being too controlling by setting a deadline. On the other hand, the author is expressing his needs and boundaries, which is valid in a relationship. The question is whether setting a deadline is a reasonable way to communicate that need. If both parties have discussed this before and the deadline is part of a mutual agreement, it's different. However, if the author suddenly imposes this without considering her feelings, it might be unfair.\n\nTrust and communication are crucial here. The author wants openness, and the girlfriend's lack of sharing is a problem for him. But the way he addresses it\u2014by setting a strict deadline\u2014could be seen as a manipulation tactic or ultimatum, which is generally not healthy. The girlfriend's defensive reaction suggests she felt cornered, which might be a valid reaction if she wasn't given enough time or support to process her feelings about sharing their relationship publicly.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have mutual respect for each other's boundaries and comfort levels. The author has a right to want the relationship to be public, but the method he uses to enforce it is important. Instead of a deadline, maybe open communication and understanding her reasons would be better. However, after three years, it's reasonable for the author to feel that his needs aren't being met and to set boundaries. The key is whether the deadline is a reasonable step given the circumstances or if it's an overreaction.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is partially in the wrong because setting a strict deadline without considering her feelings could be seen as pressuring her, but he's also within his rights to express his needs. However, the way he communicated this (ultimatum-style) might be the issue. On the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior over a year of hiding the relationship after being back together could be problematic. There's nuance here, but generally, relationships require compromise and communication. The author's approach might not be the healthiest, but his frustration is understandable. The final answer might depend on whether the deadline is a last-resort step after discussions or an immediate ultimatum without prior communication.\n"
