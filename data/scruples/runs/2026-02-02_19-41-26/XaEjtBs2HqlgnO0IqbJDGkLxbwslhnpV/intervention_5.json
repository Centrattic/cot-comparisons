I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The situation is a long-distance relationship after 3 years, with a past breakup. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just saying she isn't dating anyone. The author is frustrated and wants to take a public profile picture, but the girlfriend is resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. It's important that both partners are on the same page. The author set a deadline, which might be seen as setting a boundary, but maybe the way he communicated it was abrupt. The girlfriend felt taken aback and the author got frustrated. The key points are mutual trust and communication. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that hiding the relationship without a valid reason is a red flag. But in a long-distance, maybe the girlfriend has her own reasons for not disclosing. Maybe she's worried about her friends' reactions or her own privacy. The author's approach of setting a deadline could be seen as demanding, which might pressure her. However, he also mentions he wants to give her a chance after 3 years, showing he's trying to work on it.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's response (accusing him of lying) seems defensive and might indicate she feels attacked. The author's frustration is valid if he desires openness. But maybe he should have approached the conversation more collaboratively instead of setting an ultimatum. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Setting boundaries is okay, but the method and tone matter. Since he's giving her a chance but is firm, and she's not meeting his needs, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the way he communicated it might have contributed to the conflict. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Considering all factors, perhaps the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong) because setting an ultimatum without understanding her perspective could be harsh. But others might argue he's justified in wanting openness. Hmm, need to decide based on standard relationship advice. Usually, ultimatums can be problematic if not discussed thoroughly. So leaning towards A.\n"
