I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They're in a long-distance relationship that's been going for three years, with a past breakup. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, only her family. The author wants her to be open about their relationship to avoid complications, like her friends getting close to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Long-distance relationships already have unique challenges. The author is setting a boundary, which can be healthy in relationships. Boundaries help establish mutual respect and clarity. However, the way he communicated this might be an issue. He mentioned getting frustrated and not saying \"I love you\" back could indicate that the conversation was rushed or not handled well. That might have hurt her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's response of saying she told friends she's not dating anyone and just mentions seeing him when asked might be a way to maintain some privacy. Maybe she's dealing with social pressures or past experiences that make her hesitant to be open. The author's demand for an ultimatum could feel controlling or impatient. While wanting transparency is understandable, setting a strict deadline without considering her reasons or feelings might be overstepping.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's friends know their status is a key point. Relationships should be mutual in terms of expectations. If he expects openness from her but hasn't had to do the same (though he says his friends know), maybe there's an imbalance. But in this case, he's pushing for her to be open, which is fair if both partners agree on that expectation. However, the approach taken here\u2014threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't comply\u2014might not be the best way to handle it. Healthy communication is about working through issues together rather than imposing ultimatums.\n\nThe girlfriend's accusation that he's lying about other things is concerning. It could indicate a pattern of mistrust or deflection. But the author's frustration is valid too, as he's been patient for three years. Still, the way he addressed it might have come off as confrontational. Setting a deadline is a boundary, but how it's communicated matters. Instead of an ultimatum, maybe discussing the reasons behind his need for openness and working together on a timeline could be more effective.\n\nIn some cases, ultimatums can be necessary if one's needs aren't being met, but they should be approached with care. The author's intention to move forward might be right, but the method could be improved. So, while he's not entirely in the wrong for setting a boundary, the way he enforced it might have been the issue. However, the girlfriend's resistance could also stem from valid reasons not mentioned here. Without more context, it's tricky, but generally, ultimatums can be a last resort. If the author truly wants to give the relationship a chance, maybe a more collaborative approach is better than a strict deadline. So, leaning towards the author might be in the wrong because of the ultimatum approach, but there's nuance here.\n"
