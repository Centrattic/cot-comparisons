I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years. They had a breakup during a deployment but reconciled. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends that they're back together, only saying she's not dating anyone. The author is frustrated because he wants her friends to know they're dating, so they can take pictures and have a profile pic. He set a deadline, and when she didn't meet it, he mentioned breaking up. The girlfriend responded by accusing him of lying about other things, which is a classic deflection.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. In a relationship, especially a long-distance one, trust and communication are crucial. The author feels that setting a boundary is necessary because he wants recognition from her friends, which is understandable. However, setting a strict deadline without discussing it thoroughly might come off as controlling. The girlfriend's response of deflecting and not addressing the issue directly is problematic too.\n\nBut wait, the author has been patient for three years. He's given her multiple chances, and she's been evasive. His friends already know they're dating, so there's a sense of imbalance. It's reasonable for him to want reciprocity. However, the way he presented the deadline\u2014threatening to break up if she doesn't meet it\u2014might be seen as ultimatum, which can be harsh. But considering the duration and the prior breakup, maybe his frustration is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's approach of not being transparent could be a red flag. If she's not willing to be open about their relationship after three years, that's a significant issue. The author's friends knowing they're dating versus her friends not knowing creates an asymmetry that might affect trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he communicated his needs, which is important. But the ultimatum might have been the trigger. However, given her not addressing the issue for so long, his actions are a reaction to her lack of action. The girlfriend's deflection also suggests she's not taking his concerns seriously. \n\nOverall, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. He's setting boundaries after a long period of inaction. The wrong might be on her side for not being open and for deflecting. So, Answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
