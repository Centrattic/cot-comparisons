I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The situation is a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, with a past breakup during a deployment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just her family. She's been vague with her friends, saying things like \"I'm not dating anyone\" or \"I saw him, we talked.\" The author feels frustrated because they want their relationship to be public and clear, especially for things like social media and avoiding potential issues with friends. They set a deadline, and when the girlfriend reacted negatively, she turned it back on the author, accusing him of lying about other things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of a long-distance relationship. In such situations, communication is key, but there might be valid reasons why one person isn't public about the relationship. Maybe the girlfriend has personal reasons for not wanting her friends to know\u2014like past experiences, fear of judgment, or maybe her friends are in a different location or situation. However, the author has all their friends informed, which is a key difference. But does that mean the girlfriend has to do the same?\n\nThe author's main point is about wanting transparency and not wanting to hide the relationship. They mention wanting to post pictures together and have the friends know, to avoid any misunderstandings or other relationships. The deadline they set seems like a way to push for that transparency. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she's uncomfortable with that pressure. Turning it around to trust issues might be her way of deflecting, but maybe she feels the author is being controlling.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, setting boundaries is normal in a relationship. If the author values public acknowledgment and the girlfriend isn't meeting that need after 3 years, it's reasonable to address it. But on the other hand, maybe the girlfriend has her own reasons that the author isn't considering. The deadline approach might come off as ultimatum-like, which can be hurtful. Communication about expectations is important, but the method might affect how it's received.\n\nThe user mentions that the girlfriend didn't hide the breakup initially, which could imply inconsistency. However, maybe she's been trying to protect the author's feelings during the deployment or something. The author's frustration is valid if they feel the relationship isn't being acknowledged publicly, but pushing too hard might create more conflict. The girlfriend's reaction of turning it into a trust issue might be a defense mechanism, but that doesn't make the author wrong for expressing their needs.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should communicate their needs and find a middle ground. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting the relationship to be public, but the way they approached it (with a deadline and a tone that caused frustration) might be problematic. However, considering the time frame and the long-distance aspect, the author's request isn't unreasonable. The girlfriend's refusal to meet this need could be a deal-breaker for the author, which is their right.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a deadline. They have the right to expect transparency and public acknowledgment in the relationship, especially after three years. The issue might be more about how the request was communicated, but the core issue of wanting the relationship to be recognized is valid. The girlfriend's reaction and deflection might indicate deeper issues, but the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary.\n"
