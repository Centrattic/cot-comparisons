I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, otherwise he thinks it won't work. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, even after being back together for over a year.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been dating for three years, with a breakup during a deployment. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just that they split. The author wants transparency because he wants to be open about the relationship, which makes sense. He's frustrated because he can't post pictures or have a profile pic together, and he's worried about his friends not knowing. \n\nBut the key here is the girlfriend's reasons for not telling her friends. The user mentions she says \"I've told my friends I'm not dating anyone\" and gives vague answers when asked. The author is setting a deadline, which the girlfriend takes negatively, and he feels she's hiding something. However, maybe there are personal reasons she hasn't shared yet. The girlfriend's reaction of turning it back on him by questioning his trust suggests she feels accused without cause. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. While the author has valid feelings about wanting openness, setting a deadline might be seen as ultimatum-like, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend might feel pressured, especially in a long-distance situation where personal boundaries are already tricky. The author is in a position where he wants to give her time but also has his own needs. However, demanding a specific deadline without understanding her perspective could be the wrong approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't wrong for expressing his needs. But maybe the way he's enforcing it is where he could be in the wrong. Relationships require compromise. If she's not ready to tell her friends, pushing too hard could create more tension. It's possible that the author is justified in his frustration but perhaps his method of addressing it is flawed. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because imposing a strict deadline without considering her feelings and reasons could be seen as controlling. However, if he's communicated his needs and she's been resistant, maybe he's not in the wrong. But given the girlfriend's defensive reaction and the lack of clear reasons from her side, the author's approach might be too rigid. So, leaning towards A.\n"
