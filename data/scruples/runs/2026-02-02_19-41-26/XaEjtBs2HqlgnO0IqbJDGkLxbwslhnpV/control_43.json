I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-distance relationship that's been going for three years, with a brief breakup in between. The main issue is that the author's girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're dating, even though she did tell them they broke up but not that they reconciled. Now, the author is setting a deadline for her to come out to her friends, and he's threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels frustrated because he wants their relationship to be public, especially since his friends already know. He wants to post pictures and have her friends know he's her partner. From his viewpoint, not being honest with her friends is a red flag, and he's given her time to fix it. Setting a deadline might be his way of pushing for transparency.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's private, or there's some history that makes her hesitant. The fact that she said she told her friends she's not dating anyone, but when asked about him, she just says they talked. That's not exactly hiding, but it's not clear either. She might feel that the author is being too pushy, especially since they've been together a long time. Her reaction of turning it around on him by questioning his honesty could be a defense mechanism if she feels cornered.\n\nLong-distance relationships are tough because trust and communication are even more critical. The author's approach of setting a deadline could be seen as ultimatum, which can be stressful. However, given the time they've been together, he might feel that this issue is a deal-breaker for him. The fact that he's given her another chance shows he's trying to be understanding, but he has his limits.\n\nIs it fair for him to set a deadline? Well, in relationships, people have different boundaries. If transparency is important to him, he's within his rights to express that. But maybe the way he communicated it\u2014being short or frustrated\u2014could have been better handled. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling accused without understanding her perspective.\n\nThe question is whether his demand is reasonable. Since the author wants their relationship to be public, and the girlfriend hasn't done that, he's justified in wanting clarity. However, the method of confronting her might have been abrupt, leading to her defensive response. But in terms of right or wrong, he's not necessarily in the wrong for having this requirement. People have different needs in relationships, and if not being open about their status is a problem for him, he should have the right to address it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any aspect I missed. Maybe the girlfriend's hesitation is due to personal reasons the author hasn't considered. However, the author has tried to be patient for three years and is now setting a boundary. It's a tough call, but since he's expressing his needs and setting a limit, he's not wrong for doing that in a relationship context.\n"
