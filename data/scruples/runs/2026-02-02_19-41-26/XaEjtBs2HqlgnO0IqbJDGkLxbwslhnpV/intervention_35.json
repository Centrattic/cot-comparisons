I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline. They've been together for three years with a previous break-up. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just that they split. The author is frustrated and wants to publicize their relationship, but the girlfriend isn't doing it, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that not telling friends is a problem because it implies hiding something, and they want to be open. They set a deadline, which the girlfriend found upsetting. She responded by bringing up trust issues unrelated to the situation. The key points here are communication, trust, and boundaries.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should feel heard. The author's frustration is understandable if they value openness, but setting a deadline and ultimatum could be seen as pressuring. The girlfriend might feel that her boundaries or reasons for not telling friends aren't respected. Maybe she's private or has past experiences affecting her comfort level. The author's approach of giving a deadline and threatening to end the relationship if it's not met might be seen as ultimatums, which can be controlling or disrespectful of her autonomy.\n\nHowever, long-distance relationships can be challenging, and the author might feel the need for mutual commitment. Still, the way the author communicated their needs\u2014by setting a deadline and using it as a breaking point\u2014could be problematic. It's possible the author didn't give enough room for the girlfriend's perspective or reasons. Instead of setting a firm deadline, discussing the importance of openness and finding a middle ground might be better.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, bringing up unrelated trust issues, could indicate defensiveness or that she feels attacked. But that doesn't necessarily make the author right. The author might have overstepped by making it a deadline rather than a mutual discussion. The key is whether the author's approach was respectful of her feelings and circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the author communicated their needs in a way that felt controlling or dismissive of her feelings, they might be in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's refusal to disclose their relationship is causing significant distress and the author has valid reasons, it's a complex situation. But from the information given, the author's ultimatum approach seems harsh, especially given the long-term nature of the relationship. They should have worked on understanding each other's perspectives before setting such a deadline. So, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
