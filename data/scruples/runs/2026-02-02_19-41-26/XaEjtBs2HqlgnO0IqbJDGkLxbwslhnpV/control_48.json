I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a 3-year long-distance relationship with a past breakup. She told her family but not her friends, and when asked, she says she's not dating anyone. The author is frustrated because he wants her friends to know they're dating, not just to avoid her dating others but also for public acknowledgment. When he set a deadline, she got defensive and accused him of mistrusting her.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author feels that hiding the relationship is an issue, especially when he's open about it. But is setting a deadline fair? It depends on both partners' comfort levels. Some people take time to come out of the closet, especially if they're in a different social circle or have past experiences. The girlfriend might feel pressured, especially since her friends already think they're not dating. The author's frustration is valid because transparency is important, but maybe the approach was too abrupt. Instead of a deadline, discussing the feelings and finding a compromise could have been better. Also, her reaction suggests she might feel mistrust if he's not giving her space. So, setting a deadline without understanding her reasons could be seen as controlling. However, the author isn't wrong for wanting honesty. It's a balance between respecting her boundaries and expressing his needs. Maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because he's expressing his needs, but the method could be improved. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's advocating for transparency which is reasonable, but the deadline might be pushy. Maybe it's a B (No) because he's not wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
