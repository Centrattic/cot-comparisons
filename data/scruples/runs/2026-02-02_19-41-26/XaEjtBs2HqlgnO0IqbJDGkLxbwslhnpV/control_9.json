I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline. They've been together for three years, had a breakup during a deployment, got back together, and now the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together. The author sets a deadline, which upsets the girlfriend because she hasn't told her friends yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication and mutual respect in relationships. The author feels frustrated because they want their relationship to be public, especially since their own friends know. The girlfriend, however, hasn't shared this information with her friends, leading to tension. \n\nLong-distance relationships are challenging, and communication is key. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after three years. But setting a deadline with a threat to break up might be seen as ultimatum-like. However, the girlfriend's response\u2014deflecting by accusing the author of unrelated issues\u2014might indicate her own issues with trust or communication.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of telling her friends she's not dating anyone, even after being back together for over a year, could be a red flag for the author. The author's desire for transparency is valid, especially when they want to post pictures and update their profile. The key here is whether the author's approach was reasonable. Ultimatums can be a form of control, but in this case, the author is seeking a boundary they feel is necessary for the relationship's health.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's hesitation might stem from personal reasons, like fear of judgment or past experiences. The author might need to understand her perspective, but after three years, it's also reasonable to expect some level of openness. The author's approach might be firm, but it's a boundary they feel is necessary. The girlfriend's reaction of turning the conversation to unrelated accusations could indicate defensiveness, which might not help the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting transparency, but their method of setting a strict deadline with a breakup threat could be seen as extreme. Alternatively, the girlfriend might have valid reasons for her hesitation, but not communicating those could be her fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're setting a boundary based on their needs and the girlfriend isn't meeting that, the author might not be wrong. But setting a deadline without understanding her reasons could be problematic.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary for transparency, which is reasonable in a committed relationship. However, their approach could be improved by discussing the issue rather than giving an ultimatum. Still, the core issue is about differing needs for public acknowledgment, and the author isn't wrong for wanting that.\n"
