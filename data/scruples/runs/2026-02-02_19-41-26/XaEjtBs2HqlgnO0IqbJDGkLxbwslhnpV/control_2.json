I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, had a breakup during a deployment, and she hasn't told her friends they're back together. He gave her a deadline, and she reacted negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Long-distance relationships can be tough, especially when there's a significant time invested. The author is frustrated because he wants their relationship to be public, which is understandable. He mentions that his friends already know, so he's being consistent. The girlfriend, on the other hand, hasn't told her friends, using vague explanations. The author feels that not being open is a problem, especially since they've been together for so long.\n\nBut setting a deadline with an ultimatum might come off as controlling. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014accusing him of lying about unrelated things\u2014suggests she felt pressured or attacked. Maybe she's dealing with her own reasons for not telling her friends yet. The author's approach might have been too harsh, given the long-term nature of the relationship and the previous breakup. Instead of an ultimatum, maybe a more open conversation about her hesitations would have been better.\n\nHowever, the author also has valid points. After three years, expecting some level of openness is reasonable. The girlfriend's current approach could lead to misunderstandings or jealousy if her friends aren't aware. The author wants to take pictures and have a public status, which is a common desire in relationships. The key issue here is the method of communication. Ultimatums can be hurtful and might have been unnecessary. The author's frustration is justified, but the way he addressed it might have been too abrupt.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed his feelings without setting a strict deadline. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling cornered. So, while the author's desire for openness is valid, the approach might have been wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ultimatum, but there's nuance. However, some might argue that after three years, the author's stance is reasonable. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because of the ultimatum and the immediate reaction it caused.\n"
