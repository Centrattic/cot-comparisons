I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, with a brief breakup during a deployment. She hasn't told her friends they're back together, just told them she's not dating anyone, or made vague comments when asked. The author is frustrated because they want their relationship to be public, maybe for clarity and to avoid jealousy, but the girlfriend hasn't been clear. He set a deadline and then the girlfriend reacted negatively, even bringing up unrelated trust issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and boundaries in a relationship. The author feels that since his friends know they're dating, it's important for hers to do the same for transparency. But the girlfriend is being vague, perhaps due to her own reasons like fear of judgment, past experiences, or maybe not being ready to fully commit. The author is trying to set a boundary, which is understandable, but the way he did it might come across as ultimatums, which can be stressful in a relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014turning it back on him and bringing up unrelated trust issues\u2014suggests that she might feel attacked or that the deadline is too harsh. Maybe she's struggling with her own insecurities or fears about her friends' reactions. The author's frustration is valid, especially after three years, but relationships also require mutual understanding and compromise. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries is okay, but the way he communicated it as a deadline with a threat to break up if not met might be problematic. He should have discussed this earlier and perhaps found a more collaborative approach. However, his desire for transparency isn't unreasonable. On the other hand, the girlfriend not telling her friends could be seen as hiding the relationship, which can lead to issues. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but his approach could be improved. However, since he's setting a deadline as a condition for continuing the relationship, which is a form of ultimatum, that could be seen as the wrong move. Relationships require negotiation, and forcing a timeline without considering her feelings and reasons might not be fair. So, perhaps the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of the ultimatum approach, but there's nuance here.\n"
