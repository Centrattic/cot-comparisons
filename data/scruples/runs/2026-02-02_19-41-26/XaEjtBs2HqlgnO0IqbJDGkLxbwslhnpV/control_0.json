I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the guy who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been in a long-distance relationship for 3 years, with a breakup during a deployment. They got back together and are now back together for over a year. The main issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends about being in a relationship again. The guy is frustrated because he wants her to tell her friends, setting a deadline and threatening to break up if she doesn't. She responds by deflecting and bringing up unrelated trust issues.\n\nHmm, so the guy's perspective is that after 3 years, the relationship should be public knowledge, especially since his friends know. He wants to take pictures and update their profile pic, which makes sense if they're in a committed relationship. But she hasn't told her friends yet, maybe out of fear or past experiences. The key here is communication and mutual respect.\n\nSetting a deadline might be a bit extreme. Relationships require compromise, and maybe he should have discussed this earlier instead of suddenly giving a deadline. However, her not telling friends after so long could also be a problem, especially since they're back together. Her solution of saying she's not dating anyone might be misleading.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's frustration is valid. It's important for both partners to be open with their social circles. But how he handled it\u2014threatening to break up and giving a deadline\u2014could be seen as ultimatum-like, which can be hurtful. She responded defensively, bringing up trust issues that aren't directly related, which might show her anxiety or insecurity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He might have overstepped by setting a firm deadline and using that as a reason to break up. However, his desire for transparency is understandable. Conversely, she's been withholding information for a long time. It's a bit of a gray area. The question is whether his approach was right. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings more and worked with her to find a solution rather than setting a strict deadline. So, leaning towards A\u2014maybe he's in the wrong because his response was too harsh, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, she's equally at fault for not being open. But the question is specifically about the author. Since he set a deadline and threatened to break up, which can be seen as controlling, maybe A is the answer. But if transparency is important, then maybe it's B. Hmm.\n"
