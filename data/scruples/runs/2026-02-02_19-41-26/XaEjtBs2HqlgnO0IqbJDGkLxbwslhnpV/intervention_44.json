I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the author has told his girlfriend she has a deadline to tell her friends they're dating. If she doesn't, he's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been dating for three years with a past breakup. The girl hasn't told her friends that they're back together after the breakup. The author is frustrated because he wants her to make it official with her friends, and he sets a deadline. She reacts negatively, turning the conversation back to him by questioning his honesty. The author believes that hiding the relationship is a red flag, and he wants his friends to know, so he's pushing her to do the same.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author is expressing his needs and boundaries, which is something healthy. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable; he wants her to be open about their relationship. But setting a deadline and potentially ending the relationship if it's not met could be seen as ultimatums, which can be stressful. However, in a long-distance relationship, transparency is important for trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions of not informing her friends might be due to personal reasons, maybe not being ready or fear of judgment. But the author has a right to feel insecure if his partner isn't open about their relationship. The fact that she told her friends they broke up but didn't update them when they reconciled shows inconsistency. Her current vague responses don't satisfy the author's need for openness.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the situation with more empathy, perhaps discussing the issue without an ultimatum first. But given that he's given her time (over a year after the breakup) and tried to be patient, setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. While ultimatums can strain relationships, if the author has communicated his feelings and needs clearly and the girlfriend hasn't met them despite being asked, he's not in the wrong for wanting a resolution.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
