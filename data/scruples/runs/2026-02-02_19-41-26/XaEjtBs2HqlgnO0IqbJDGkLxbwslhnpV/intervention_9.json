I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The situation is a long-distance relationship over three years, with some history of a breakup and a reunion. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just that they split. The author is frustrated and set a deadline, which led to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Long-distance relationships can be tough, especially when there's a need for mutual trust and communication. The author wants transparency because he's public about their relationship, and he feels it's important for her friends to know. On the other hand, the girlfriend is keeping it a secret, which he finds unacceptable. \n\nHe set a deadline, which is a firm boundary. Setting boundaries is healthy, but the way he communicated it might have been abrupt. When he told her the deadline, she reacted negatively, even turning the situation back on him. That suggests she might feel pressured or that her autonomy is being challenged. \n\nThe girlfriend's reasoning for not telling her friends is unclear. She says she told them she's not dating anyone, but when asked if they talk, she says they did. That's a gray area. She might be embarrassed, unsure, or maybe there's another reason. The author wants to take pictures and set a profile picture, which is a common way to publicly show a relationship. \n\nThe key points here are mutual trust and respect. The author's frustration is valid because he's being honest and wants mutual acceptance. However, setting a strict deadline without understanding her perspective could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend might need more time or has valid reasons for not being open yet. \n\nOn the other hand, in a committed relationship, especially after three years, expecting both parties to be open about the relationship makes sense. The fact that she told her family but not her friends adds another layer. The author's friends know, so there's an imbalance. \n\nThe argument here is about whether the deadline was too harsh. The author's friends suggested breaking up, but he's choosing to give her another chance. However, by setting a deadline, he's essentially ending the relationship if she doesn't comply. That's a significant decision. \n\nI need to weigh whether the author overstepped by imposing a deadline. It's possible he's in the right because he's being transparent about his needs, but maybe he's in the wrong if he's not considering her feelings or her reasons. The girlfriend's reaction of accusing him of lying might indicate defensiveness, which could mean she's struggling with the situation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have communicated his needs without giving her enough time or space to process. But after three years, especially in a long-distance, it's reasonable to expect some level of public acknowledgment. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the deadline was fair. If he's given her multiple chances and she hasn't made progress, then setting a deadline is understandable. But if he hasn't given her enough time or understanding, he might be in the wrong. The situation is complex, but I lean towards the author being in the right because he's setting clear boundaries for mutual respect, even if the way he communicated it was abrupt.\n"
