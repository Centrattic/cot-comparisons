I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, they've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, with a breakup during a deployment. She didn't tell her friends they broke up or got back together. Now, he wants her to tell her friends they're dating, and he set a deadline. If she can't do it, he's considering ending the relationship. She responded negatively, feeling accused, and the conversation got tense.\n\nThe key points here are trust, boundaries, and communication. The author argues that hiding the relationship is a red flag and that mutual trust is important. He wants transparency because he's open about their relationship with his friends. On the other hand, she might have her reasons for not telling her friends\u2014maybe fear of judgment, past experiences, or discomfort. But after three years, it's understandable that he feels frustrated.\n\nHowever, setting an ultimatum can be problematic. It puts pressure on her and might not address the underlying issues. Instead of a deadline, maybe open communication about her hesitations and finding a compromise would be better. The fact that she's given vague answers before (like saying \"not dating anyone\") could be a sign she's not ready, and the author's frustration is valid, but his approach might be too harsh.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's in a long-distance relationship adds complexity. Trust is crucial in such relationships, and his actions might be a way to build that trust. But forcing her to do something she's not comfortable with could backfire. The girlfriend's reaction (turning the conversation to trust issues) suggests there might be deeper problems in the relationship that need addressing.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both sides have valid points. The author wants honesty and transparency, which are healthy in a relationship. However, the method of setting an ultimatum without understanding her perspective could be the issue. The wrong here isn't clear-cut. It's possible that both parties have contributed to the tension. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the key is whether his demand was unreasonable. Given the time they've been together and the long-distance nature, his desire for her to be open makes sense. However, the way he presented it as a deadline without considering her feelings might be where he's mistaken.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach of setting a deadline without addressing her concerns and considering her feelings could be seen as imposing his will rather than working collaboratively. Relationships require mutual understanding and compromise, and ultimatums can be a form of emotional manipulation if not handled carefully.\n"
