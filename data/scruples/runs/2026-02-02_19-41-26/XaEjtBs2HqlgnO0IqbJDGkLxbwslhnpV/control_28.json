I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been dating for three years. There was a breakup during his deployment, but they got back together. The main issue is that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends that they're back together. She told her family but not her friends, and when she's asked about him, she just says they talked, not that they're dating.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he wants her to publicly acknowledge their relationship with her friends. He sets a deadline, saying if she can't do it by then, things might not work out. The girlfriend reacts defensively, bringing up unrelated issues and not continuing the emotional support he expected (like saying \"I love you\" back). \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author has valid feelings. In a relationship, especially after three years, he might feel it's important for his partner to present their relationship as serious and committed. Since he's in a long-distance situation, public acknowledgment from her friends could help them feel more connected and validated. It's reasonable for him to want her to be open about their relationship, especially since he's already out as a couple with his friends. \n\nHowever, the way he approached it might be problematic. Setting a deadline with an ultimatum could come off as pressure, which might make the girlfriend feel cornered. Relationships require communication and compromise, and maybe the author didn't give her enough time or didn't understand her reasons for not telling her friends yet. The girlfriend's defensive reaction suggests she might be dealing with her own insecurities or reasons for not coming out to her friends. Maybe she's worried about their reaction, or perhaps there's something else going on that he hasn't considered.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has already taken a while to tell her family, and now her friends are still in the dark. The author's frustration is understandable after three years. It's important for both partners to feel supported and accepted, and the girlfriend's current approach (saying she's not dating anyone) might be confusing or hurtful to him. \n\nThe key points here are mutual trust and communication. The girlfriend's response about not knowing if he's lying about other things adds another layer\u2014maybe there's underlying trust issues on her part, or she's deflecting. The author's approach was direct, but perhaps he should have had more open conversations about her feelings before setting a deadline. \n\nIn summary, while the author has a legitimate desire for his relationship to be acknowledged publicly, the method of setting a hard deadline might have been too abrupt without understanding her perspective. However, the girlfriend's refusal to engage constructively and her deflection could also be an issue. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's actions stem from wanting transparency, which is reasonable. But the way he communicated it could have been more empathetic. The girlfriend's response is also problematic, but the core issue is about mutual respect and understanding. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because his request is about public acknowledgment, which is important in a relationship. But the way he handled it could be improved. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's setting a deadline and the girlfriend reacts negatively, but the desire for her to be open is valid, the answer might be B (No). However, if the problem is that he's pressuring her without considering her feelings, then A (Yes). It's a tough call. But given the context, the author's intentions are fair, though the execution could be better. So the answer is B.\n"
