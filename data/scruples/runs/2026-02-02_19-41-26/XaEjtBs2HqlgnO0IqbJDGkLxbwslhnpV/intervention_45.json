I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author wants his girlfriend to tell her friends they're in a relationship by a certain deadline, otherwise he thinks it's not going to work. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, only her family, and she's given vague answers when her friends asked. The author is frustrated because he wants to be open about their relationship, take pictures together, and set a profile picture so friends know they're an item. When he sets a deadline, she gets upset and accuses him of being untrustworthy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They've been dating for three years, had a breakup, and got back together. The girlfriend hasn't informed her friends about the relationship status, which the author finds unacceptable. The key points are the long-distance aspect and the girlfriend's reluctance to be fully open with her friends. \n\nThe author's argument is that transparency is important, especially since his friends know about the relationship. He's setting a boundary, which is fair in relationships. However, the girlfriend's reasons for not informing her friends could be valid\u2014maybe she's private, cautious, or has had past issues. The fact that she told her family but not friends might indicate different levels of comfort. \n\nThe author's approach of setting a deadline might be seen as ultimatum-like, which can be harsh. But considering the three-year duration, it's reasonable to expect some progress. The girlfriend's reaction of deflecting with trust issues might be her way of coping, but it doesn't address the original problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author's frustration is valid because he wants recognition and openness. However, setting a hard deadline without understanding her perspective could be seen as demanding without empathy. On the other hand, she should also communicate her reasons for not informing her friends yet. \n\nSince the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to evaluate if his demands are unreasonable. The author wants to be public in the relationship, which is a common expectation. However, in a long-distance scenario, maybe the girlfriend has valid concerns. But after three years, it's reasonable to want full disclosure. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting transparency, but the way he set the deadline might be abrupt. However, the girlfriend's refusal to meet halfway could also be an issue. The answer hinges on whether the deadline is a fair boundary or an overstep. Given the context, the author's stance is understandable, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the deadline was too strict without discussion, that could be a problem. However, considering the time frame and her lack of progress, the author's position seems justified.\n"
