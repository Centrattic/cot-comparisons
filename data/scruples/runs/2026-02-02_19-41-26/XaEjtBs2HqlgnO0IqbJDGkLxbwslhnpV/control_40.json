I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The key points here are the long-distance aspect, the three-year relationship, a previous breakup, and the girlfriend's current lack of transparency with her friends.\n\nFirst, the author wants his girlfriend's friends to know about their relationship. He's frustrated because she hasn't done so for three years, even though he's made it public with his friends. He sets a deadline, and when she doesn't meet it, he threatens to break up. She responds defensively, bringing up unrelated issues.\n\nIn a long-distance relationship, trust and communication are crucial. The author has legitimate concerns about his friends not knowing they're an item, which could lead to misunderstandings or jealousy. However, setting a strict deadline might come off as ultimatum-like, which can be seen as pressuring her. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being invaded, especially if she's not ready to make the move. The fact that she's been hesitant before and now is using trust issues as a counter suggests there's underlying tension.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author has been patient for three years, including after a breakup. It's reasonable for him to want mutual commitment in terms of public acknowledgment. The girlfriend's approach of saying she's not dating anyone might be misleading, which the author isn't okay with. It's a balance between respecting her boundaries and expecting transparency.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's not necessarily being unreasonable, but maybe his approach could have been more collaborative. However, given the context, setting a deadline after giving her time might be justified. The girlfriend's reaction might indicate deeper issues, but the author's stance on wanting to be recognized in her social circle is understandable. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to communicate better.\n"
