I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years with a previous breakup. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just said she's not dating anyone, which the author finds insufficient. He set a deadline, and she reacted negatively, bringing up trust issues.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially long-distance. The author feels it's important for her friends to know they're dating, which is reasonable because you want your partner to be open about your relationship. However, setting a strict deadline and threatening to end things if she doesn't comply could be seen as ultimatums, which can be stressful. The girlfriend's response about trust suggests she might feel the author isn't being open himself, maybe hinting at past issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends already know they're dating, so it's a two-way thing. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to discuss their needs and find a middle ground. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he's handling it\u2014setting a hard deadline and not considering her perspective\u2014might be the problem. Maybe he should have had a more open conversation instead of giving an ultimatum. The girlfriend's deflection about trust could also be a red flag, but that's her issue to address.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? He's justified in wanting openness, but the method he used to enforce it might be harsh. It's a balance between setting boundaries and respecting the other person's feelings. Since he's willing to give her time but is firm, it's a bit of a gray area. However, using a deadline as a threat could be seen as manipulative. So maybe A (he is in the wrong) because of the ultimatum approach, but the situation is complex. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's asking for transparency. Hmm.\n"
