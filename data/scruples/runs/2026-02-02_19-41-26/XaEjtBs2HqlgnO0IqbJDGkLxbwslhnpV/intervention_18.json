I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The couple has been in a long-distance relationship for three years, with a brief breakup in between. The girlfriend hasn't informed her friends about being back together, and when asked, she says she told them she's not dating anyone. The author feels frustrated and sets a deadline, but the girlfriend reacts negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. They've been together for a while, which suggests they're serious. The girlfriend's friends not knowing about the relationship might be an issue because in a committed relationship, especially after three years, transparency is important. The author wants to be open about their relationship, which is understandable. However, setting a deadline could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's struggling with sharing personal information.\n\nThe girlfriend's response of deflecting by accusing the author of lying about unrelated things might indicate her discomfort with the pressure. Maybe she feels that if she tells her friends, it might complicate things, especially in a long-distance scenario. But the author's perspective is valid too; he wants mutual trust and openness. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Boundaries in relationships are okay, but the way he communicated it might be problematic. Instead of a strict deadline, discussing the issue and understanding her concerns could be better. However, given the time they've been together, the author's desire for the relationship to be acknowledged by both sides is reasonable. \n\nThe key points here are communication style and mutual respect. If the girlfriend is resistant to sharing, maybe there's an underlying issue she hasn't discussed. The author's frustration is valid because he wants the relationship to be recognized, but the approach might have been too confrontational. \n\nIn conclusion, while both have valid points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting transparency, but his method of setting a deadline without understanding her perspective might be part of the problem. However, considering the duration and the importance of mutual trust, the author's stance makes sense. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
