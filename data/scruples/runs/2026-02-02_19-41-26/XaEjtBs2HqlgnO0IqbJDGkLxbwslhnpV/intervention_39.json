I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The situation involves a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, with a previous breakup. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends about the current relationship, even though she did mention the breakup. The author is frustrated and wants to set a deadline, which caused some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In a long-distance relationship, communication is crucial. The author has been open about the relationship with their friends, which the girlfriend hasn't. The author feels that not telling friends is a red flag, possibly indicating secrecy. They want to set a boundary, which is understandable. However, setting a deadline could be seen as ultimatum-like, which might be harsh depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was defensive, turning the situation back on the author. This might suggest she feels cornered or unready to make such a public commitment. The author's frustration is valid, given the time invested and their own transparency. But is the deadline reasonable? Three years is a significant time, so expecting some level of disclosure from the partner might be reasonable. However, the method of setting a deadline could be problematic if it's not discussed collaboratively.\n\nCultural or personal differences might play a role. Maybe the girlfriend has valid reasons for not wanting to tell her friends yet. The author's approach of giving a deadline might not allow for understanding her perspective. The girlfriend's defensive reaction might indicate that the deadline was delivered in a confrontational way, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, mutual trust and communication are key. The author's expectation of transparency is valid, but the way it's enforced matters. Ultimatums can create pressure and resentment. The author might be in the right in wanting honesty but in the wrong in the approach. Alternatively, if the deadline was a necessary boundary for the author's peace of mind, then it's a valid step. \n\nConsidering the girlfriend's history of not disclosing the relationship before, maybe the author's concern is justified. However, the timing and manner of the deadline could be an issue. The answer might depend on whether the deadline was discussed and understood as a mutual agreement or if it was imposed unilaterally. The author's frustration is understandable, but the approach could be seen as inflexible. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, I think the author has a valid concern but handled it poorly by setting an ultimatum without considering the girlfriend's feelings and possible reasons. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
