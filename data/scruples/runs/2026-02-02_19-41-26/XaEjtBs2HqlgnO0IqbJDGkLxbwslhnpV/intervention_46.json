I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the man is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends that they're dating by a certain deadline. If she doesn't, he's considering breaking up. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, and when she does mention him, it's vague. The man feels frustrated because he wants his relationship to be public, and he thinks hiding it is a red flag. But after he sets this deadline, she gets defensive, accuses him of not trusting her, and the conversation turns heated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The man's perspective is that after three years, including a past breakup, it's important for his girlfriend's friends to know they're dating. He feels that the current vague mentions aren't sufficient and that hiding the relationship might indicate something's wrong. He's setting a boundary based on his needs, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends, maybe out of fear, social anxiety, or other personal reasons. The man is pressuring her, which could be seen as valid if he's clear about his needs. But pushing too hard might be where he goes wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not disclosing. Maybe she's worried about her friends' reactions, or maybe she's private by nature. The man's ultimatum could be triggering her insecurity or causing her to feel cornered. His reaction to her defensiveness might be dismissing her feelings, which isn't healthy. The fact that she accused him of not trusting her suggests that she feels attacked, which could be a valid response if he's setting an ultimatum without understanding her side.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The man is right to express his needs, but the way he does it matters. Setting a deadline might be reasonable if both parties agree it's important, but if it's a non-negotiable for him and she's not ready, that's a conflict. Long-distance relationships already have challenges, and trust and communication are crucial. If the man is okay with giving her more time but is still frustrated, maybe there's a middle ground. However, the ultimatum approach is a big decision that affects both people's happiness.\n\nThe girlfriend's response of turning the conversation to his trust issues might be her way of deflecting or showing her hurt, which the man didn't handle well. He might be in the wrong if he didn't consider her perspective and reacted with frustration instead of empathy. But if he made his needs clear and she still hasn't addressed it despite the time given, maybe he's justified. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether their communication was open and respectful, and whether the deadline was a fair boundary or an ultimatum that disregards her feelings.\n"
