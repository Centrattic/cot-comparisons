I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years. They had a breakup during a deployment but got back together. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet. The author is upset that she hasn't been open about their relationship and set a deadline for her to tell her friends, with the threat of breaking up if she doesn't. The girlfriend was taken aback, got short with him, and he noticed she didn't say \"I love you\" after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that after three years, it's important for her friends to know they're dating. He mentions that his friends already know, so there's a key difference. He wants to be public with their relationship, maybe for social validation or to prevent others from being interested in his girlfriend. Setting a deadline could be his way of pushing her to be honest, which he sees as necessary for trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends. The author says she told them they broke up but not that they reconciled. Her solution is vague, like saying she didn't mention any dating at all. Maybe she's hesitant because of past experiences, or maybe she's not ready to fully commit or share the relationship. The author's frustration might come from feeling that she's hiding something, which he sees as a lack of trust.\n\nThe author's approach of setting a deadline with a breakup threat could be seen as ultimatums, which can be problematic in relationships. Ultimatums often create pressure and might not resolve the underlying issue. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014turning it into an accusation about trust\u2014suggests that she might feel attacked or that the author isn't respecting her boundaries. Maybe she has valid reasons for not telling her friends yet, such as fear of judgment, past betrayals, or personal insecurities.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that after three years, especially with a long-distance setup, transparency is crucial. His friends know, so he might feel it's unfair that hers don't. Also, he wants to be able to show their relationship publicly, which is reasonable in a committed relationship. The question is whether setting a deadline is reasonable or if he should have approached it differently, like having an open conversation without a threat.\n\nCultural or personal differences might play a role here. Some people might need more time to adjust to being in a public relationship, especially if they've been through a breakup and reconciliation. The author's friends knowing could be a point in his favor, showing he's open. But the girlfriend's hesitation might indicate that she's not ready for that level of commitment or public declaration.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual understanding and communication. The author might be in the right to express his needs, but using a deadline with a breakup threat could be seen as extreme. The girlfriend's reaction could stem from feeling that her autonomy is being disregarded. However, the author's frustration is understandable given the time they've been together and the long-distance challenges. The key issue is whether the approach was respectful and considerate of her feelings and reasons for not telling her friends yet.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for expressing his needs, but his method could be seen as harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the deadline and ultimatum were the problem, then maybe A (he is in the wrong). But if his stance is reasonable given the circumstances, then B (he's not in the wrong). It's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the approach might have been too confrontational, leading her to deflect. So perhaps the author's method was wrong, even if his desire for openness is valid.\n"
