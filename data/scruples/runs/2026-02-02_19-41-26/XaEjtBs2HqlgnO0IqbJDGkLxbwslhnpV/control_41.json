I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a long-distance relationship with their girlfriend, and they've been together for three years. There was a breakup during a deployment, but they got back together. The main issue is that the author wants the girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating, but she hasn't done that yet. The author set a deadline for her to do this, and if she doesn't, they think it won't work between them. The girlfriend reacted badly, got frustrated, and didn't reciprocate the \"I love you\" part.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They want their relationship to be open and acknowledged, especially since their friends already know. They feel that hiding the relationship is a sign of something to hide. It's important for them to have mutual trust and transparency. Setting a deadline makes sense because they've been together a long time and the girlfriend hasn't taken this step, even after getting back together. The author is trying to address a boundary that's important to them.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, even though she told her family. Maybe she's hesitant or there's a reason she hasn't shared it with her friends. The author's ultimatum might have come as a shock, leading her to deflect by bringing up unrelated trust issues. It's possible she's struggling with her own boundaries or maybe privacy concerns. The fact that she's defensive and brought up the author's possible secrets suggests she might feel accused or under pressure.\n\nNow, considering long-distance relationships, communication is key. The author's frustration is warranted if transparency was a mutual expectation from the start. However, setting a strict deadline without understanding her perspective could be seen as pressuring her. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's needs. If the author didn't discuss this earlier and instead gave an ultimatum, that might be where they went wrong. But if they've been trying to communicate this for a while and she's resistant, the author has a right to their boundaries.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014being defensive and bringing up unrelated issues\u2014doesn't help resolve the problem. However, the author's approach of setting a deadline might have been too abrupt. Maybe they should have had a more open conversation about why it's important for her to tell her friends and explore her reasons for hesitating before setting a firm deadline. That way, they could work together to find a solution that respects both parties' feelings.\n\nIn summary, the author has valid reasons for wanting openness, but the way they communicated their expectations might have been too harsh, leading to conflict. The girlfriend's defensiveness isn't justified if the author was clear about their needs. However, the author could have approached the situation with more empathy and dialogue first. It's a balance between setting boundaries and understanding the other person's perspective. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been more constructive. However, since the question is binary, choosing between A and B. Given that the author had a valid concern and communicated their needs (albeit with a deadline), I think they're not in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. Hmm.\n"
