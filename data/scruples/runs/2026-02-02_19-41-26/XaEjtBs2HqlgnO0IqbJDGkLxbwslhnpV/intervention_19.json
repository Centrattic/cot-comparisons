I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to think through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for setting a deadline for their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, had a breakup during deployment, and she hasn't told her friends they're back together. He feels frustrated because he wants her friends to know, so they can be a couple openly. He set a deadline and said if she doesn't do it by then, they might break up. She got upset and turned the conversation into an accusation about him lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Long-distance relationships are tough, especially with trust and communication. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, only her family. She's been saying she's single when she's with her friends, which the author finds unacceptable. He wants her to be open about their relationship. Setting a deadline is a big step, but maybe he's justified because he's been patient for three years. On the other hand, pressuring someone to come out to their friends could be seen as demanding, especially if the girlfriend is uncomfortable doing so. \n\nThe girlfriend might have her own reasons for not telling her friends yet. Maybe she's anxious, or there's something else going on. The author's frustration is valid, but imposing a deadline with a breakup threat might be too much. However, considering the time they've been together and the fact that he's been open about their relationship, maybe he's justified in wanting transparency. The girlfriend's reaction of deflecting by accusing him of lying might indicate she's struggling with trust issues, which could be a separate problem.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might have communicated his needs, but perhaps not in a way that allows for understanding each other's perspectives. Setting boundaries is okay, but doing so in a way that's respectful of both parties' feelings is important. If the girlfriend is resistant to this step, maybe there's more to her hesitation than meets the eye. However, the author's stance is that he can't continue hiding the relationship, which is a valid need. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the deadline was set without considering her feelings and reasons, then maybe yes. But if he's given her time and now is setting clear expectations, it's about mutual respect. The fact that she hasn't told her friends for three years, even after getting back together, suggests she might not be ready or there's an issue. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he communicated it might have been confrontational. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, needing openness is valid, and setting a deadline could be a reasonable step if both have discussed it. But if he didn't allow her to explain her side, then he might be wrong. Given the info, I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because his desire for transparency is reasonable, especially in a committed relationship. However, the way he handled it could be improved.\n"
