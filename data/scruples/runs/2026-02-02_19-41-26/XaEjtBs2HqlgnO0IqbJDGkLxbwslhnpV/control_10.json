I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is in a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend. They've been dating for three years, including a small breakup during a deployment. She told her friends they broke up but never mentioned they're back together. Now, he's setting a deadline for her to tell her friends they're dating. If she doesn't, he's considering ending the relationship. She responded negatively, turning the conversation back to him by accusing him of lying about other things.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is transparency. The author wants her to publicly confirm their relationship, which he sees as important for trust and commitment. From his perspective, hiding the relationship might indicate a lack of commitment, especially since he's open about them. He's given her a chance to fix it, showing patience over three years. \n\nBut wait, long-distance relationships are already challenging. She's been in the relationship for three years, so maybe her hesitation is due to personal reasons. Maybe she's not ready for public commitment, or perhaps she has different boundaries. Her friends not knowing might not be a red flag for her, but a big deal for him. \n\nHe set a deadline, which is a tough choice. On one hand, it's his right to set boundaries. On the other, he should consider her feelings and reasons. The fact that she turned the conversation to him by accusing him of lying suggests she felt cornered or defensive. That might indicate she's not ready to meet his expectations, or she's feeling the pressure.\n\nThe author's actions stem from wanting honesty and commitment. However, imposing a deadline could be seen as ultimatum, which can be hurtful. But in a long-term relationship, especially with a history of breakups, setting clear expectations is reasonable. The problem is whether the demand is fair. Since it's a long-distance, perhaps she has valid reasons for not wanting to announce their relationship. Maybe her friends aren't supportive, or she's dealing with personal issues. The author might be prioritizing his needs without understanding hers.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He's justified in wanting transparency, but the way he approached it might have been too abrupt. However, given their history and his patience over three years, setting a deadline isn't necessarily wrong. The answer depends on balancing his needs with her autonomy. Since the question is binary (A or B), I need to decide. Most people would say setting a deadline is a reasonable choice, especially in a commitment after three years. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
