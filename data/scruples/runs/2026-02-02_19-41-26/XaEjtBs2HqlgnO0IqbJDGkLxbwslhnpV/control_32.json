I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The context is a long-distance, 3-year relationship with a past breakup. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, and her current approach is vague.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that after three years, it's reasonable to expect her friends to know they're dating. He's setting a deadline to address this, which she didn't expect. His frustration is valid because he wants her friends to know they're a couple, which he sees as important for commitment and transparency. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not sharing yet. Maybe she's anxious about her friends' reactions, or there's something in her past that makes her hesitant. The author's approach of setting a strict deadline and threatening to break up if it's not met could be seen as ultimatums, which can be stressful. However, the key point is whether he's in the wrong for expressing his needs clearly and setting boundaries, especially in a long-distance situation where trust and communication are crucial.\n\nThe long-distance aspect complicates things because they can't rely on physical presence to build trust. The author mentions that his friends know their status, which he points out as a difference. The girlfriend's response of deflecting and accusing him of lying might indicate her discomfort with the confrontation or her own insecurities. \n\nIs setting a deadline unreasonable? In a long-term relationship, partners often have expectations about social interactions. If the girlfriend hasn't communicated her reasons for not telling her friends, the author is within his rights to express his needs. However, the way he delivered it (threatening to break up) might be harsh. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his method is the best.\n\nConsidering that the author is trying to address a long-standing issue and has given the relationship a chance for her to fix it, he might not be in the wrong. The girlfriend's lack of communication and the author's clear boundaries suggest that he's acting within his right to set expectations. However, the ultimatum could be seen as extreme. But given the context of a 3-year relationship and the importance of mutual trust, his position might be justified. So, the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
