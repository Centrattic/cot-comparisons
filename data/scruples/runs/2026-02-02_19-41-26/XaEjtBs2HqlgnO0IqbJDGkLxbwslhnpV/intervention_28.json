I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the guy is upset that his girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're dating. They've been together for three years, had a breakup during a deployment, and she hasn't told her friends they got back together. The guy sets a deadline for her to inform her friends, else he might end the relationship. The girlfriend reacted by bringing up unrelated issues and not agreeing to the terms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of a long-distance relationship. Communication is crucial, and trust is important. The guy wants his relationship to be recognized by her friends, which is understandable. However, setting a deadline with an ultimatum could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's not ready. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, but she's given some partial disclosures, like saying she saw him. The guy feels that this isn't enough and that hiding the relationship is a problem.\n\nOn one hand, the guy has a right to want his relationship to be acknowledged, especially since he's open about theirs. On the other hand, setting a strict deadline might be too much, especially if there are underlying reasons why she's hesitant to tell her friends. Maybe she's dealing with personal issues or her friends might not be supportive. The girlfriend's reaction of bringing up unrelated issues and not addressing the main point directly suggests there might be unresolved tensions or a lack of communication.\n\nBut the key here is whether the guy is in the wrong. If he's communicated his feelings and boundaries clearly, and she hasn't met them despite knowing his stance, maybe he isn't in the wrong. However, setting an ultimatum without understanding her perspective could be problematic. It's possible that he's being reasonable in seeking openness, but the way he's handling it might not be the best approach. The girlfriend's response of deflecting could also indicate that she's not ready to address the issue directly, which complicates things.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. If he's given her time and is now setting a deadline, perhaps he's trying to push for progress. But the method might not be the healthiest. The girlfriend might feel that he's not respecting her boundaries or reasons for not telling her friends yet. The fact that he's in the wrong could depend on whether he's being inconsiderate or if she's being unreasonable in her secrecy.\n\nI think it's a balance. The guy might not be entirely in the wrong if he's communicated his needs, but the approach of an ultimatum could be seen as harsh. However, given the length of the relationship and the existing issues (like the breakup and her not telling friends before), maybe he's justified in wanting this change. The girlfriend's reaction might indicate that she's not ready for the level of commitment he's seeking, which could be a sign that the relationship is moving in different directions. So maybe the guy isn't entirely in the wrong, but the situation is complex.\n"
