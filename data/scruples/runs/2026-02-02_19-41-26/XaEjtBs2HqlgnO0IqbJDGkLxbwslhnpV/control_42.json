I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. The situation is a long-distance relationship with a three-year history, including a previous breakup during deployment. He's frustrated that she hasn't told her friends, even though she did inform her family and others about their split and reunion. She's been ambiguous, telling friends she's not dating anyone but giving vague info when they meet.\n\nFirst, the key points are the long-distance aspect, the timeline, and the author's need for public acknowledgment from her friends. He feels that hiding the relationship is a red flag, given his own openness. She reacted negatively, deflecting to trust issues. \n\nHe's set a deadline and given her a final ultimatum. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that. \n\nFrom his perspective, after three years, it's reasonable to expect some level of commitment and transparency. Long-distance relationships already have challenges; hiding the relationship from friends might indicate insecurity or lack of commitment. His frustration is valid if he wants mutual recognition and support from both sides' social circles.\n\nHowever, she might have her reasons for not disclosing, maybe fear of judgment, past experiences, or personal boundaries. But after three years, especially in a long-distance setup where physical presence isn't regular, public acknowledgment can be crucial for emotional stability and validation. The author's demand isn't unreasonable if it's about mutual respect and commitment. \n\nHe's not pressuring her into something harmful; he's asking for transparency that aligns with his own actions. The fact that she did tell her family but not friends is inconsistent. His setting a deadline is a boundary, which is his right in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction of deflecting to trust issues without addressing the core problem might indicate her own unresolved feelings or anxiety.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his needs in a healthy relationship dynamic. The answer should be B.\n"
