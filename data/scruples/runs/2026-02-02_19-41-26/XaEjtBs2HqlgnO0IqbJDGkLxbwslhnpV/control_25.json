I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, had a breakup during deployment, and now she hasn't told her friends they're back together. He's frustrated and set a deadline, which caused some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants transparency because he's public about their relationship. His friends know, and he wants her friends to as well. It's understandable that he feels the current situation isn't sufficient. But she's taking longer to come out to her friends, maybe due to personal reasons or fear. Setting a deadline could be seen as a way to push for openness, but does that make him wrong?\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require trust and communication. He might feel it's important for mutual trust, but maybe she has her reasons for not telling her friends yet. Her reaction of deflecting by accusing him of lying suggests she might feel cornered or defensive. However, he's given her time and now is setting boundaries, which is reasonable in a long-term relationship.\n\nLong-distance relationships already have challenges, and the fact that they've been together for three years shows commitment. If she can't meet his needs after this time, maybe it's a sign the relationship isn't balanced. But is it fair to give a deadline? It's a boundary, which is okay, but the way it was communicated might have been harsh if it made her defensive.\n\nHe wants her to be clear with her friends to avoid ambiguity. Her current actions are vague, which isn't enough for him. However, relationships should be about mutual respect. If he's setting a deadline, he's taking a stand, which isn't necessarily wrong. But if she's struggling with this, maybe he should have been more understanding. However, after three years, it's reasonable to expect some level of transparency, especially if it's causing him distress.\n\nThe key points are the duration of the relationship, the long-distance aspect, and the need for mutual trust. He's not wrong for wanting her friends to know if they're together, especially since she's already told her family. But maybe pushing for a deadline without understanding her perspective could be problematic. However, after multiple chances and a breakup, it's his right to set boundaries. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong.\n"
