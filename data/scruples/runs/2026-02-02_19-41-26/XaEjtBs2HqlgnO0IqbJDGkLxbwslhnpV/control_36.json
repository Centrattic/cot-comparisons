I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, with a past breakup and a reunion. The girl hasn't told her friends they're back together, only her family. The author is frustrated and wants her to be open with her friends to avoid complications, especially since he's public about their relationship. He gave her a deadline, and she reacted negatively, deflecting by accusing him of lies.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially long-distance. The author feels it's important for their relationship to be acknowledged by her friends. Hiding the relationship might lead to jealousy or misunderstandings. Setting a deadline could be seen as a reasonable request, but it's a big ask. However, the way he presented it might have been abrupt, causing her to feel cornered. She might feel that he's not respecting her boundaries or her pace. The fact that she's been in a long-distance situation might add stress, making her hesitant to involve her friends. Her deflection suggests she might feel defensive or unready to take that step. \n\nOn the other hand, after three years, the author's need for transparency is valid. Trust and openness are crucial. But pushing too hard might strain the relationship. The author isn't wrong for wanting honesty, but the method could be improved. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs. Since he's given her time and is still requesting a specific action, it's a matter of mutual respect. Neither is entirely in the wrong, but the approach could be more collaborative. So, the answer is B (No), but with the caveat that both need to work on communication.\n"
