I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, had a breakup during a deployment, and she hasn't told her friends they're back together. He wants her to be open about their relationship, especially since he's public about it. She reacted negatively, and he's frustrated because he feels like hiding the relationship is a red flag.\n\nFirst, consider communication in a long-distance relationship. It's already challenging without secrecy. The author's main issue is that her friends don't know they're dating, and she's been vague about it. He's given her time before, but now he's setting a deadline. Is that reasonable? Well, after three years, especially in a long-distance setup, transparency is important for trust. But the way he communicated this might have been harsh, especially if he's giving her an ultimatum and she's been avoiding it for a while.\n\nHer response is defensive, which suggests she might feel accused or pressured. She's been hiding the relationship, which could indicate insecurity or fear of her friends' reactions. The author wants to be open and take pictures, which he feels is necessary for mutual trust. However, setting a hard deadline without understanding her reasons could be seen as controlling. But on the other hand, after three years, it's reasonable to expect a certain level of commitment and openness.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the author communicated his needs and set boundaries clearly, that's part of a healthy relationship. However, if he's using an ultimatum without considering her feelings or reasons for not telling her friends, that could be problematic. The fact that she accused him of lying might indicate she's feeling defensive due to pressure.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a balance. He's justified in wanting transparency, but the approach might have been too abrupt. However, given the time frame and the nature of their relationship, setting a deadline could be a valid step. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) if the deadline is too harsh without discussion, but B (not in the wrong) if he's justified in seeking openness after three years. I think the key is whether the deadline was communicated with understanding. Since he's given her chances before, maybe B is the answer.\n"
