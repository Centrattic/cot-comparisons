I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a guy in a long-distance relationship with a girlfriend they've been dating for three years. He's upset because she hasn't told her friends that they're still dating after a breakup. He's setting a deadline for her to come clean, otherwise he might end things. She told her friends they split but didn't update them after they got back together. Now he wants her to be open with her friends so there's no confusion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Long-distance relationships are tough, especially when there's a history of a breakup. The guy is frustrated because he wants transparency. On the other hand, the girl might have her reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's still processing the breakup, or she's afraid of how they'll react. The author is setting a deadline, which is a big deal. That pressure could be coming from a place of wanting commitment and honesty.\n\nBut is he wrong to do that? Communication is key in any relationship. If the guy has been feeling this way for a while and brought it up, maybe he's justified in wanting clarity. However, setting an ultimatum can be seen as manipulative if it's not mutual. The girl might feel pressured and react defensively, as she did by turning the accusations back on him. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might see it as him seeking honesty. The key points are the long-distance nature, the three-year duration, and the fact that he's giving her a chance to fix it. If the girl is resistant to change and the issue is important to him, maybe he's right to set boundaries. However, if his approach was confrontational and without considering her feelings, that could be problematic.\n\nI should weigh whether the author's actions are reasonable. Ultimatums can damage trust if not handled carefully. But in a long-term relationship, certain issues like not being accepted by the partner's friends might be deal-breakers. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of handling it could be the issue. Maybe he should have communicated his needs earlier and more gently. However, given the time they've been together, expecting her to be open with her friends isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of both. He's justified in wanting honesty, but his approach might have been too harsh. But since the question is a yes/no, I need to decide. The user thinks A, but I'm leaning towards B because he's asserting his needs in a relationship where communication is crucial. However, the ultimatum might be where he goes overboard. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A because setting a deadline without giving her a chance to explain her side could be wrong. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B because he's seeking transparency which is important in a committed relationship. It's tricky. I think the key is whether his requirement is fair. If he's given her time and this is a deal-breaker, then it's understandable. But if he's been impatient, maybe A. Given the context, I think the author isn't in the wrong because after three years, wanting her friends to know is reasonable. So answer B.\n"
