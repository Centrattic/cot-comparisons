I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship that's been going on for three years, with a past breakup. The main issue is that the author wants the girlfriend to tell her friends about their relationship by a certain deadline, and if she doesn't, he's considering ending things. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, but has told her family. She's been vague, just saying she's not dating anyone or that she saw him. The author feels frustrated and wants to make her friends aware, so he's setting a deadline. The girlfriend reacted negatively, accused him of lying about unrelated things, and brought up trust issues.\n\nHmm, so first, the author is setting a clear boundary here. He's communicating his needs and expectations, which is generally a good thing. But is it fair? Let me think. They've been together for three years, with a long-distance setup. Maybe the girlfriend has her reasons for not telling her friends. Maybe she's anxious, maybe there's some social pressure, or maybe she's just not ready. But the author is feeling that this is a deal-breaker. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is trying to address his frustration, but is the deadline appropriate? Setting a deadline can be valid if both partners have agreed on it. However, if the girlfriend hasn't been given a chance to explain her reasons or if the deadline is unreasonable, it might not be fair. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014bringing up trust issues and accusing him\u2014might be a deflection or a sign that she feels attacked. \n\nThe author mentions that all his friends know they're dating, which he sees as a key difference. That might contribute to his frustration. But in a long-distance relationship, there are more challenges, including social isolation. The girlfriend might be struggling with the distance and not wanting to complicate her social life further. \n\nIs it wrong for the author to want her to be open about their relationship? That's a common expectation. However, the approach might be the issue. Instead of setting a strict deadline, maybe discussing the reasons and working together on a plan would be better. But the author is in a long-distance situation, which can make communication tricky. \n\nAlso, the fact that she told her friends they broke up but didn't update them when they reconciled is a red flag. That could show a pattern of hiding the relationship, which might be a problem. However, the author is now demanding a deadline, which the girlfriend might not be ready for. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have valid feelings. The author's need for openness and commitment is understandable. The girlfriend's hesitation might stem from her own insecurities or fears. But the author's ultimatum could be seen as pressuring her, which might not be healthy. \n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's communicating his needs, which is important. On the other hand, setting a deadline without understanding her reasons might be too harsh. The girlfriend's reaction might indicate that she feels the pressure is too much. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to address his own needs and set boundaries, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's approaching it\u2014without perhaps fully considering her perspective\u2014could be problematic. But ultimately, wanting to be acknowledged by her friends is a reasonable expectation. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his need for openness, which is valid. But I need to check if there's a better angle.\n"
