I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're dating, and the author is setting a deadline for her to do so. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has been dating for three years, had a breakup, and got back together. The author is frustrated that the girlfriend hasn't told her friends. He wants her to be public about their relationship, like having a profile picture and friends knowing they're together. He's given her a deadline, and when she didn't meet it, he set a cutoff point. \n\nNow, the key points to analyze. The girlfriend's behavior: she told her friends they broke up but didn't update them when they reconciled. She's been vague about their relationship, which the author finds unacceptable. He's setting boundaries because he wants mutual transparency. \n\nThe author's actions: He's communicating his needs clearly, even if it's a hard conversation. He's given her time (over a year since getting back together) and is now setting a firm deadline. The girlfriend's response was to deflect and accuse him of unrelated issues, which might indicate her defensiveness.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, communication and boundaries are important. If both partners agree on the level of public disclosure, then it's mutual. However, the author is imposing his expectation without considering her possible reasons. Maybe she's private, or there's a cultural reason, or fear of judgment. The author is using an ultimatum, which can be harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, after three years and a long-distance situation, wanting to be open with friends is reasonable. The girlfriend's lack of action might be the issue here. The author is trying to address a problem that's been ongoing. \n\nBut setting a deadline and threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't comply could be seen as extreme. It depends on whether the author has given her enough support and understanding. If she's been resistant and he's tried to be patient, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the way he approached it\u2014giving a firm deadline and ultimatum\u2014might come off as controlling. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels attacked, leading to a defensive response. So, maybe the author could have handled it differently. However, he's justified in wanting transparency, especially since he's open about the relationship. The balance here is between respecting each other's needs and setting personal boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns, his approach might be too confrontational. But given the context of the long-distance and the time frame, he's not entirely wrong. It's a nuanced situation where both could have communicated better. However, the girlfriend hasn't met his needs despite the time given, so the author's stance might be justified. But the method of setting a firm deadline could be the issue.\n"
