I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a 3-year long-distance relationship with his girlfriend. They had a breakup during his deployment, and she told her friends they broke up but didn't say they got back together. Now, he's giving her a deadline to tell her friends they're dating again, and he's threatening to end the relationship if she doesn't. She's been vague with her friends, just saying they talked or that she's not dating anyone. He's frustrated because he wants her friends to know so they don't hit on her, and he wants to be open. She reacted negatively, turning the conversation back on him by accusing him of lying about other things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that after three years, it's reasonable for her friends to know they're dating. He's in a long-distance, which can be tough, and maybe he feels that not being open is a breach of trust. On the other hand, maybe she's dealing with personal reasons for not wanting to share their relationship. Perhaps she's been hurt before, or she's not comfortable being open for some reason. Maybe she's afraid of her friends' reactions, or maybe she just doesn't want to draw attention to their relationship for other reasons.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author set a deadline, which might be seen as ultimatum-like. While he's given her time in the past, maybe he didn't communicate his feelings clearly earlier. Setting a deadline could be a way to push for transparency, but if he's only just doing this now, maybe he should have addressed it sooner. Also, when she didn't meet his expectations, he called her out, and she turned it back on him. That could indicate a communication breakdown. \n\nAnother angle is that he wants her friends to know so they don't approach her. That's a valid concern if he's worried about her not being protected from potential issues. But she might not see it the same way. It's possible she's handling her own boundaries differently. Maybe she's not in a social circle where others would hit on her, or she doesn't see it as a problem. \n\nThe fact that he's been open with his friends is a contrast. But relationships are two-way streets, and both partners have different comfort levels. He might be right in wanting openness, but he's also imposing his standards on her without considering her feelings. The ultimatum could be seen as controlling if she's not ready to make that change. \n\nAlso, when she turned the conversation back on him, it might suggest that she feels he's being unfair or that he's double standards. If he hasn't discussed his concerns calmly before, she might feel blindsided now. Maybe she's been avoiding the topic because it's hard for her, and his approach made her defensive. \n\nIs he wrong for setting a deadline? It depends on how it's handled. If he's communicated his feelings and needs over time and still hasn't seen progress, maybe a deadline is reasonable. But if he's being rigid and not considering her perspective, that's a problem. The fact that she's been in a long-distance relationship for three years and hasn't told her friends yet might indicate deeper issues, like fear of commitment, social anxiety, or past experiences. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. If one partner is comfortable with openness and the other isn't, they need to find a middle ground. However, the author is giving her a deadline, which could push her to make changes. But if she's not ready, it might not be feasible. The question is whether his approach is respectful. If he's been patient for three years and she's still not told her friends, maybe he's justified in setting a boundary. On the other hand, maybe he's being too rigid and not allowing for personal growth at her own pace. \n\nI think the key here is whether the deadline was discussed and explained properly. If he just set it without understanding her reasons, he might be in the wrong. But if he's given her time and now feels it's necessary for their future, he's not necessarily wrong. It's a tough call. The fact that he's open about wanting to be public and she's not, there's a mismatch. But in a relationship, both need to make sacrifices. If she can't meet his needs, maybe it's a dealbreaker. However, if he's not considering her feelings, he's part of the problem. \n\nI'm leaning towards B, that he's not in the wrong. He's setting boundaries, which is reasonable in a relationship. But there's nuance here. It's possible he's being a bit controlling by giving a deadline, but given the context, he's trying to protect the relationship. The answer might be B, but with the understanding that both need to communicate better.\n"
