I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a long-distance relationship where the author tells his girlfriend that if she doesn't tell her friends they're dating by a certain date, he doesn't think the relationship will work. They've been together for three years, with a past breakup during a deployment. She hasn't told her friends they're back together, just her family. He wants her to be open with her friends, but she's been vague. He set a deadline and now she's upset, even turning the accusation back on him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author feels frustrated because he wants public recognition of their relationship, especially since his friends know. He's given her a deadline, which she perceived as a requirement. She's been evasive, using phrases like \"not dating anyone\" but then mentioning interactions with him. The author is trying to encourage openness, which is common in relationships. However, setting a deadline might come across as ultimatum-like, which can be stressful for the other person.\n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. The author expressed his needs, but maybe the way he set the deadline was too rigid. She might feel pressured, especially if she's not ready to publicize their relationship for personal reasons. It's possible there's a mismatch in their expectations about relationship visibility. The author's frustration is valid because he wants mutual transparency, but his approach might have been abrupt. On the other hand, the girlfriend's hesitation could be due to personal discomfort or fear of social pressure. She turned the issue back on him, which might indicate defensiveness or her own insecurities.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he communicated his needs without considering her feelings or reasons for hesitation, that could be an issue. However, wanting openness and setting boundaries is also reasonable. The problem might be how he framed his request as a deadline with a threat of breaking up, which can feel coercive. Alternatively, if she's been avoiding the issue for years, his frustration is understandable.\n\nIn long-distance relationships, trust and communication are even more critical. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting honesty, but the method of imposing a deadline without understanding her perspective could be problematic. It's a balance between asserting one's needs and being empathetic to the other's feelings. Since the girlfriend is resisting, maybe the author should explore why she's hesitant instead of just setting a deadline. However, after three years, his patience might be wearing thin, which is also valid.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for expressing his needs, but his approach could have been more collaborative. The answer might hinge on whether the deadline was reasonable and if he gave her enough time and support to come around. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt attacked, which could mean the author's method was harsh. But without more context, it's hard to say. The key is whether setting a firm deadline with a breakup threat is fair. In relationships, ultimatums can be seen as controlling, so perhaps the author is in the wrong in this case. Alternatively, if the girlfriend is avoiding commitment, he's justified in seeking change.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. The answer could go either way, but based on common relationship advice, ultimatums are often discouraged unless all other options have been exhausted. Since the author wanted to give her a chance but set a deadline, maybe he's in the wrong. Or maybe not, since open communication is important. I think the answer might be A (wrong) because he set a deadline that led to conflict without understanding her reasons. But others might say B (not wrong) because he's advocating for transparency. The girlfriend's reaction is also a factor; if she turned it on him, that's not ideal either. But the question is about the author. If the author's actions were the root cause of the conflict, then he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's resistance is the issue, then he's not. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I'll lean towards A because of the ultimatum aspect.\n"
