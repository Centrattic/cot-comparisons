I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the boyfriend is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline or else they'll break up. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, even though they've been dating for three years and had a previous breakup. The boyfriend wants to be open about their relationship, take pictures together, and set a profile picture, but the girlfriend hasn't fully come out about their relationship to her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the boyfriend setting a deadline for the girlfriend to tell her friends. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, which is causing frustration. The boyfriend feels that hiding the relationship is a red flag, and he wants transparency. The girlfriend's response to his demands is defensive, bringing up unrelated issues and accusing him of not trusting her. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend is trying to establish a level of openness that's important to him. In a committed relationship, especially after three years, wanting mutual transparency is reasonable. On the other hand, setting a deadline with a threat of breaking up might be seen as ultimatum behavior, which can be controlling. The girlfriend might have her own reasons for not disclosing, maybe fear of judgment, past experiences, or personal boundaries. \n\nThe fact that they're in a long-distance relationship might complicate things. Long-distance relationships often require more trust and can have challenges in maintaining communication. The boyfriend's frustration is valid because he wants his relationship recognized, but demanding a specific action with a deadline might be too much. The girlfriend's reaction of bringing up unrelated accusations could indicate defensiveness or underlying issues in the relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that his friends know about them, so he expects the same from her. However, people have different comfort levels and reasons for their social circles. The girlfriend might not be ready or might have different social dynamics. The key here is whether setting a deadline with a breakup threat is fair. Some might say it's reasonable to set boundaries, while others might argue it's pressuring her without understanding her perspective.\n\nI should also consider if the boyfriend is in the wrong by not being patient or understanding of her reasons. The girlfriend's solution of saying she's not dating anyone is insufficient for him, but maybe she's working on it at her own pace. The boyfriend's approach to give her a chance to fix it is a good point, but the way he's doing it with a deadline and ultimatum might not be the healthiest approach. Healthy communication is key here, and ultimatums can lead to resentment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend's desire for transparency is valid, using a deadline with a breakup threat might be where he crosses into being in the wrong. The girlfriend's defensiveness is a reaction to pressure, which isn't ideal, but the boyfriend's method of enforcing transparency could be seen as controlling. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the ultimatum.\n"
