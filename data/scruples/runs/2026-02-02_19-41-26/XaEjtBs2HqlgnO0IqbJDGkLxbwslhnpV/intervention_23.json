I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their girlfriend. The main issue is that the author told their girlfriend she has a deadline to tell her friends they're dating, or else the relationship might not work. They've been in a 3-year long-distance relationship with a past breakup and reconciliation. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just said she's not dating anyone or made vague references. The author feels frustrated because they want the relationship to be public, and when they set a deadline, the girlfriend reacted negatively and turned the conversation back on the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is about wanting the relationship to be acknowledged publicly, which is understandable. They mention that their own friends know, so they might feel it's unfair that the girlfriend hasn't done the same. They set a deadline, which the girlfriend found surprising, leading to tension. The girlfriend's side is that she hasn't told her friends, and when the author sets a deadline, she reacts by bringing up unrelated trust issues. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author did voice their frustration and set a boundary, which is their right. However, setting a strict deadline might be seen as ultimatums, which can be problematic. The girlfriend might feel pressured, especially in a long-distance situation where she might have personal reasons for keeping it private. On the other hand, the author has a valid point about wanting mutual transparency since their friends know. \n\nThe girlfriend's response of bringing up unrelated issues could be a defensive mechanism, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong for setting boundaries. However, the way the author approached it (with a deadline) might have been too harsh. It's a balance between asserting one's needs and respecting the partner's feelings. The fact that the author is willing to give her more time shows they're trying to be understanding. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about transparency, the method of setting a strict deadline might be where they went wrong. It's possible that a more flexible approach, discussing the issue without a deadline, could have been better. But the core issue of wanting mutual acknowledgment isn't inherently wrong. However, the deadline could be seen as an ultimatum, which can be damaging. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ultimatum, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, maybe B (not in the wrong) because they're expressing their needs, albeit in a strong way. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I think the strict deadline and the way it was presented might make them at fault. So I'll go with A.\n"
