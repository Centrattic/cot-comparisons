I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're in a long-distance relationship, been dating for 3 years. There was a breakup during a deployment, but they reconciled. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, just that they split. Now the author is setting a deadline, and if she doesn't tell her friends by then, he's not sure if it'll work. The girlfriend is upset, didn't say \"I love you\" after he brought it up.\n\nImportant factors: Long-distance makes communication tricky. The author wants transparency because his friends know they're dating. He's frustrated because he wants to post pictures and have her friends know he's her boyfriend. The girlfriend is hiding the relationship from her friends, which he sees as a problem unless there's something to hide. But maybe she has her reasons\u2014maybe she's shy, or there's some history, or other personal issues.\n\nThe author's approach was to set a hard deadline. Is that reasonable? It might be seen as ultimatums being too harsh, especially in a long-term relationship. But after 3 years, maybe it's a valid concern. The girlfriend might feel pressured, especially if she's not ready. The fact that she's been hiding the status from friends for so long could indicate she's uncomfortable with public relationships or maybe has trust issues from past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has reasons: trust, wanting friends to know, avoiding jealousy or confusion. The girlfriend's argument about mutual trust might be a red herring, deflecting the real issue. But maybe there are underlying issues she hasn't addressed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. Setting a deadline could be seen as pushing for something important, but it's also possible he's not considering her feelings or reasons. The girlfriend might need time, but after 3 years, the author's frustration is understandable. The key points are communication and mutual respect. If the author didn't discuss this with her and just set a deadline without understanding her perspective, that might be the issue. But if he's been patient and finally set a boundary, maybe he's justified.\n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The author might not be entirely in the wrong if he's communicated his needs, but the way he presented it (as an ultimatum) could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to feeling cornered. So maybe the author is partially at fault for not finding a middle ground. But given the long-term nature and the long-distance aspect, his demands for public acknowledgment could be reasonable. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the author being in the right because he's setting boundaries after a long time, but others might see it as too controlling. The answer might depend on cultural or personal expectations about relationships and privacy.\n"
