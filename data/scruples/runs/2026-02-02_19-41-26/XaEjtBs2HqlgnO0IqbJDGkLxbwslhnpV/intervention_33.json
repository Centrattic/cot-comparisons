I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They're in a 3-year long-distance relationship, had a breakup during deployment, and she hasn't told her friends they're back together. The author wants her to be open and sets a deadline, which upsets her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a long-distance relationship, which can be challenging. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends about the relationship, even after getting back together over a year ago. The author feels it's important for friends to know since they're public about it in their own circles. Setting a deadline might be a way to address this, but is it the right approach?\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author's frustration is valid because honesty and transparency are important for trust. However, setting a firm deadline with an ultimatum could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's struggling with this. The girlfriend's reaction might indicate she feels accused or not understood. It's possible she has personal reasons for not disclosing the relationship yet, which the author hasn't fully explored.\n\nThe author mentions that his friends know, so he's comfortable with public status. But in a long-distance relationship, dynamics can be complex. Maybe the girlfriend feels vulnerable or has past experiences making it hard to share. The author's approach might not consider her feelings, leading to her feeling attacked. While the author's desire for openness is reasonable, the method of imposing a deadline without understanding her perspective could be the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, after three years, it's reasonable to expect some level of commitment and transparency. The girlfriend's current solutions (saying she's not dating anyone) are misleading. The author has a right to want honesty. However, using an ultimatum might not be the healthiest way to handle it. A better approach might be discussing her hesitations and working together to find a compromise, rather than setting a strict deadline.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's deflection to unrelated issues suggests she might be defensive or hurt. The author's frustration is understandable, but forcing a timeline without addressing her concerns could damage trust. It's important to balance personal needs with the partner's feelings. So, while the author isn't entirely wrong in wanting honesty, the way he's handling it might be part of the problem. Therefore, he could be partially in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more empathy.\n"
