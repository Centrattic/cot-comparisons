I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years, with a breakup and reconciliation in between. The key points here are the duration of the relationship, the fact that it's long-distance, and the specific issue of not telling her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In a three-year relationship, especially with a long-distance component, communication and trust are crucial. The author feels that not being open with her friends is a red flag. He wants transparency because he wants to publicize their relationship (like a profile picture) and prevent any misunderstandings among her friends. His frustration is valid because he's been open with his friends, which creates a two-way expectation.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends despite being back together for over a year. Her excuses, like saying she told them she's not dating anyone, or vague mentions when asked, don't satisfy the author. This could indicate some reluctance on her part, maybe due to fear of social changes, past experiences, or insecurity. However, the author is setting a deadline, which is a significant step. Setting boundaries is okay, but the way it's done matters. He gave her a chance to fix it, which is reasonable, but the ultimatum might come off as harsh, especially in a long-distance context where trust is already a challenge.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014deflecting by accusing him of unrelated issues\u2014suggests defensiveness. Maybe she feels pressured or unready. But the author's stance is about wanting openness, which is a legitimate need in a committed relationship. The question is whether the deadline is fair. Since it's their third year, expecting some level of commitment and mutual transparency makes sense. However, the specific issue of telling friends might not be as critical as the author believes, but since it's a deal-breaker for him, it's his right to set that boundary.\n\nIn relationships, both partners have the right to express their needs. The author isn't wrong for wanting honesty. However, the girlfriend's resistance might stem from her own issues that need addressing. The answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he's asserting his needs, but it's a nuanced situation where both parties have valid points. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is B (No).\n"
