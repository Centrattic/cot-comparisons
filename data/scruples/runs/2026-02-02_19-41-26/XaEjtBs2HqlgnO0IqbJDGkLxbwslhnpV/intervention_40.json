I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. They've been in a long-distance relationship for three years with a past breakup. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together, only her family. The author feels that not being open is a red flag and wants to move forward by setting a deadline.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author clearly expressed his needs, which is important. But setting a deadline with an ultimatum might come off as controlling. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014deflecting and bringing up unrelated issues\u2014suggests she felt cornered. Maybe she's struggling with privacy or fear of judgment from friends. The author's frustration is valid, but the approach could be too aggressive. Relationships require compromise; maybe a discussion about boundaries and reasons behind her hesitation could help. However, the author isn't entirely wrong for wanting transparency. It's a gray area. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I think it's a B (No), because he's asserting his needs, though the method could be improved.\n"
