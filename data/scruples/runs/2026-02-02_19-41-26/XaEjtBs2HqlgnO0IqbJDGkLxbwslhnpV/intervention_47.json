I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is in a 3-year long-distance relationship. They had a breakup during a deployment but got back together. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together. She tells them she's not dating anyone, and when they ask if they've talked, she just says they did. The author feels frustrated and sets a deadline for her to tell her friends they're dating. If she can't do it by then, he's not sure the relationship will work. After he brings this up, she gets defensive and accuses him of lying about other unrelated things. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nLong-distance relationships can be tough, especially when there's a lack of communication or transparency. The author is setting a boundary here, which is important. He's clear about his needs: wanting his relationship to be public, which is understandable. However, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, which is causing tension. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's reasoning for not telling her friends might matter. Maybe she's been hurt before, or there's some other personal reason. But the author doesn't mention if he's tried to understand her perspective. He just sets a deadline. That could come off as ultimatum-like, which might be heavy-handed. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a long-standing issue. He's given her time over three years, including after a breakup. He wants mutual trust and transparency, which are valid. The girlfriend's response of deflecting and accusing him of unrelated issues might indicate her own issues with trust or insecurity, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong to set boundaries.\n\nThe key here is whether setting a deadline for her to tell friends is reasonable. In a relationship, partners have the right to set boundaries about how they present their relationship. If the author's need for visibility is causing him significant stress, it's fair for him to communicate that. However, the approach of setting a firm deadline might be too abrupt, especially if there's no prior discussion about the reasons for the secrecy. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior of not telling her friends could be due to various factors\u2014maybe fear of judgment, past experiences, or personal discomfort. The author should have explored these reasons before setting a deadline. But he did mention giving it three years and a previous breakup. If he's been patient and she's still not addressing it, maybe setting a boundary is necessary. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because setting a deadline could be seen as pressuring her. But the author is also trying to protect the relationship by ensuring mutual commitment. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs and setting personal boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. He's expressing his needs, which is valid, but the method might be too forceful without understanding her side. However, given the time frame and the lack of resolution, his actions might be justified. So I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
