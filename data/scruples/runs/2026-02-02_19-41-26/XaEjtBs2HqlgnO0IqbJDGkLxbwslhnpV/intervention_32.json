I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring their girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a specific deadline. If she doesn't, he says the relationship won't work. They've been dating for three years with a breakup in the middle. She hasn't told her friends they're back together, just that they split. Her friends don't know they're back on. The author wants transparency and for her to make it official, but she's been vague. He set a deadline, and she reacted negatively, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms in relationships. Being in a three-year relationship, especially long-distance, does come with expectations of commitment and mutual trust. The author's frustration about not being open with friends might be valid because it affects how friends interact and shows a level of commitment. However, setting a strict deadline could be seen as ultimatum, which can be harsh.\n\nLong-distance relationships are challenging, and communication is key. The girlfriend's reluctance might stem from her own reasons\u2014maybe she's uncomfortable, dealing with personal issues, or social anxiety. The author's approach of giving a deadline and threatening to end the relationship if not met might be too abrupt. It's possible he didn't consider her feelings or reasons behind her hesitation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wants transparency and for others to know they're together, which is reasonable. The fact that she told her friends they broke up but not that they reconciled adds complexity. It could be seen as dishonesty. But the author's method of response\u2014imposing a deadline without understanding her perspective\u2014might have been the wrong approach. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, bringing up trust issues unrelatedly, might be a defensive mechanism. The author might have escalated the situation by not addressing her feelings first. The key here is whether the author's approach was respectful and considerate of her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, communication should be a two-way street. Setting boundaries is okay, but doing so in a way that's collaborative rather than authoritative is better. The author's ultimatum might be seen as controlling, especially in a long-term relationship where both partners should feel heard. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong for not being more empathetic and for using an ultimatum. However, the girlfriend's lack of transparency could also be an issue. The question is whether the author's approach was justified. Since the answer options are A (yes in the wrong) or B (no), and the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
