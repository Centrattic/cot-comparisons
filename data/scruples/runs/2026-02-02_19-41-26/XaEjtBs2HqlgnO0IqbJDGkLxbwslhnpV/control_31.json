I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted theAITA question is in the wrong. The situation is a three-year long-distance relationship where the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together after a breakup. The author set a deadline for her to do so, and when she didn't meet it, he gave an ultimatum. She reacted emotionally, and he's now questioning if he was right to do that.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships, especially long-distance. The author felt frustrated because his girlfriend's friends don't know they're dating, which could lead to misunderstandings or potential issues. He wants her to be open about their relationship, which is reasonable. However, setting a deadline and threatening to end the relationship might be seen as extreme, even if the issue is significant to him. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has taken her time telling her family and hasn't fully communicated the status to her friends, which could indicate she's not ready to be fully public. Her reaction of deflecting and accusing him of lies might be a defense mechanism, showing she feels cornered. The author's friends already know, so there's an imbalance here. \n\nThe main points to consider are mutual respect and the right to set boundaries. The author has the right to want transparency, but the approach of ultimatums can be hurtful. The girlfriend's hesitation might stem from personal reasons, like fear of judgment or past experiences. The fact that they've been together for three years and had a previous breakup suggests there are existing communication issues. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's trying to address a valid concern, but the method might be too harsh. However, it's also understandable that he wants commitment and openness. The girlfriend's reaction could imply she wasn't ready for the pressure. It's a bit of a gray area, but the ultimatum might cross into being overly controlling. So, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for not being more patient or finding another way to encourage her without a deadline. But the girlfriend isn't blameless for not addressing this issue earlier. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer isn't straightforward. The user asked for a choice between A (Yes) and B (No). Since the author's approach was confrontational and potentially damaging, even if his intentions were to seek openness, it's likely he's in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
