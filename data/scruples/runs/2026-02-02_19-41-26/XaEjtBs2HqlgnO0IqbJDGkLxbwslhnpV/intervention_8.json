I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-distance relationship where the author is upset that his girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're dating. He's given her a deadline to do so, and if she doesn't, he might break up. She responded negatively, and he's now seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Long-distance relationships are already challenging because of the physical separation, so communication is crucial. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends, even after being back together for over a year. The author is frustrated because he can't show their relationship publicly\u2014like changing their profile picture\u2014which is important to him. He mentions that his friends know, so he feels she's hiding their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are mutual trust and transparency. The author is setting a boundary because he values openness. However, the girlfriend's reasons for not telling her friends might be her own. Maybe she's anxious about her friends' reactions, or perhaps there's something else. The author is pressuring her to meet his needs without considering her perspective. Setting a deadline with an ultimatum could be seen as controlling, especially in a long-distance situation where she might feel the pressure is too sudden.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to communicate his needs after a long time. He gave her a chance before, and now he's firm. The girlfriend's reaction might indicate she's uncomfortable with the pressure. The author's frustration is valid if he feels he can't be open about their relationship, but the way he's handling it might not be respectful. It's a balance between setting boundaries and respecting the other person's feelings and pace.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for setting this deadline. If he's respected her previous delays but now is insisting after three years, maybe it's reasonable. But if he's not considering her reasons and is using an ultimatum, that could be the issue. The answer might depend on how the deadline was communicated and whether there was prior discussion. Since the girlfriend felt attacked, the author's approach might have been too harsh. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not being empathetic enough in his communication.\n"
