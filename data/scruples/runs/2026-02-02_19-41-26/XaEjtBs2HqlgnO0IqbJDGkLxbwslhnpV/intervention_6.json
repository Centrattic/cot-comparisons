I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, or else they'll break up. They've been together for three years but there was a breakup during his deployment. She told her friends they split but didn't mention getting back together. Now, the author is frustrated that her friends don't know they're dating again and wants her to fix that. When he sets a deadline and a condition, she reacts negatively, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, communication and boundaries in relationships are key. The author feels that transparency is important, especially since he's public about their relationship. He wants to be able to post pictures and have mutual support from her friends. However, she's been keeping it a secret, maybe due to personal reasons. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. After three years, it's reasonable to want the relationship to be acknowledged. However, setting a strict deadline with a breakup ultimatum might be seen as coercive. Relationships require mutual understanding, and maybe he should have discussed this issue earlier rather than suddenly imposing a deadline. On the other hand, the girlfriend might have her own reasons for not disclosing, maybe past issues or fear of judgment. The author's approach could be seen as not respecting her boundaries or considering her perspective. The girlfriend's reaction might be a defense mechanism if she feels cornered. \n\nIs it reasonable to set a deadline? Maybe, but the way it's presented as a binary choice (either meet the deadline or break up) could be problematic. Healthy relationships involve compromise. The author should have communicated his needs and given her time to explain her stance. The fact that she turned the conversation into an argument about trust suggests underlying issues. He might be right in wanting the relationship to be public, but his method could have been more collaborative. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, setting a strict deadline without allowing for dialogue could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The question is whether the author's approach was respectful and considerate of her feelings. The girlfriend's secrecy might be an issue, but the author's ultimatum could also be harsh. Considering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not approaching the situation with more empathy and flexibility.\n"
