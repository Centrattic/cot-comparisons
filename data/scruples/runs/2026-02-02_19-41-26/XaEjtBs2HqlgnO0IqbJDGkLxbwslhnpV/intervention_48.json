I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a long-distance relationship where the guy is pressuring his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating by a certain deadline, otherwise he's going to end things. They've been together for three years, had a break-up during a deployment, and she hasn't told her friends they're back together. She's been vague about their relationship, leading to his frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy feels that after three years, it's unreasonable to keep the relationship secret, especially since he's not hiding it. He wants her friends to know so there's no ambiguity. His reasoning is that hiding the relationship might imply something's wrong, and he wants to take pictures and have a public profile picture, which is a common way people show commitment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet. Maybe there are reasons she hasn't shared their relationship. Maybe she's shy, has had past issues, or there's some cultural or personal hesitation. The fact that she told her family but not her friends is a bit confusing. Also, when he brought up the deadline, she reacted negatively, deflecting by accusing him of not being honest. That could indicate she's under stress or maybe there's something else going on.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The guy is setting a boundary, which is his right. However, the way he's imposing a deadline might be seen as coercive, especially if she's not ready. Relationships require negotiation, and maybe he didn't give her enough space to come to her own conclusion. But on the flip side, after three years, especially in a long-distance, some level of public commitment is expected. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the guy overstepped. Setting a deadline could be seen as ultimatum, which is a strong move. But if the girlfriend has been resistant all along, maybe he's justified in seeking resolution. However, the way he frames it as a deadline without understanding her perspective might be the issue. It's possible she has valid reasons for not telling her friends yet, and he's not respecting that. \n\nAlso, the fact that she took offense and accused him of unrelated issues might mean she's feeling defensive, which he could have handled more sensitively. Maybe he should have tried to understand her reasons before setting a firm deadline. But considering they've been together three years and it's a long-distance, his frustration is understandable. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important, but so is empathy. If the girlfriend's reasons for not telling her friends are valid (maybe she's dealing with her own issues), then the guy might need to be more patient. Alternatively, if her secrecy is causing him emotional distress, he's entitled to his feelings. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the deadline was a reasonable boundary or an ultimatum without discussion. Since he gives a deadline and threatens to end the relationship, that's a significant action. However, considering the time they've been together, maybe it's reasonable. It's a tough call. I might lean towards the author being in the right if setting boundaries is necessary for his well-being, but if he didn't communicate effectively, maybe not. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction and her deflecting could imply she's hiding something, which complicates things. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I have to weigh both sides. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's seeking transparency, but he could have handled it better. The answer might be a nuanced B (not in the wrong) because he's setting a boundary, but with a note that communication is key. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and if the deadline is too rigid without understanding her perspective, then maybe A (in the wrong). \n\nBut given that they've been together three years, long-distance, and she's been secretive, maybe the author is justified. I'll go with B (not in the wrong) but acknowledge that communication could have been better.\n"
