I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-distance relationship where the author has been with his girlfriend for three years. There was a breakup during his deployment, and after getting back together, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends they're back together. The author sets a deadline for her to inform her friends, otherwise, he might break up. She reacted negatively, and the author is unsure if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that after three years, it's important for her friends to know they're dating, especially since he's open about their relationship. He wants to be able to post pictures and have her friends know they're together. On the other hand, the girlfriend hasn't told her friends yet, giving vague answers when they ask. The author setting a deadline could be seen as a reasonable request to move forward, but maybe he's being too strict? \n\nLong-distance relationships already have challenges, and communication is crucial. The girlfriend might be hesitant due to personal reasons\u2014maybe her friends are in a different place, or she's dealing with past issues. But the author has given her time, over a year since they reconciled. Setting a deadline isn't necessarily wrong, as it shows he wants commitment. However, the way he communicated it might have been abrupt, leading to her defensive reaction. \n\nThe key points are: 3-year relationship, long-distance, previous breakup, deadline set, her response. The author's frustration is valid if he feels the secrecy is unnecessary. However, pressuring someone to come out to friends can be sensitive. It depends on cultural context, her comfort level, and whether this is a deal-breaker for the author. If he's okay with it, maybe it's not his place to dictate that. But if it's affecting his trust or their future steps, then setting boundaries is reasonable.\n\nI need to decide if setting a deadline is unreasonable. Some might say that after three years, expecting openness is fair, especially if he's doing the same. Others might argue that everyone has their own timeline for sharing relationship status. The girlfriend's reaction of deflecting and turning it on him could indicate she's uncomfortable with the pressure. However, the author's request isn't unreasonable in itself. He's giving her a chance to meet his needs, which is fair in a relationship. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. But maybe he could have approached it with more empathy. The answer is likely B (No), but I need to make sure.\n"
