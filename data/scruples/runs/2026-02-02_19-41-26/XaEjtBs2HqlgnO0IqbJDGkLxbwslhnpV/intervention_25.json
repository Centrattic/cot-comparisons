I ask because she seemed taken aback by my requirement got short/frustrated and didn\u2019t say \u201cI love you too\u201d etc for the rest of our conversation before bed. #SayItback\ud83d\udd2b \n\nI told her that if she can\u2019t tell her friends by a certain date i don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to work between us anymore \n\nImportant note - we\u2019re long distance  \n\nWe\u2019ve been dating in total for 3 years. Had a small break up during my first deployment a year and a half in, but got back together shortly after. She told her friends that we split, but never that we were back together. We\u2019ve been back together for over a year now. She took a while to tell her family, but her friends still don\u2019t know.  \nHer solution to this is that \u201cI\u2019ve told my friends I\u2019m not dating ANYONE\u201d or when I was in town and her friends asked if we talked \u201cyeah I saw him we talked\u201d\n\nPeople suggested to just drop her because it\u2019s not cool, but after 3 years together I want to give it a chance for her to fix it. \nI\u2019ve been pretty frustrated about this for a while. I want to take pictures together and make a new profile pic, and so that her friends know not to get with her, as I told her the above doesn\u2019t cut it for me. There should be no reason to hide it unless you\u2019ve got something to hide, right? After I said this she immediately turned it on me and accused me of lying about unrelated things, saying \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re doing xxx thing or going to parties without telling me, so I just have to trust you just like you need to trust me\u201d \nAll my friends know we\u2019re dating, that\u2019s a key difference. \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-distance relationship where the author sets a deadline for his girlfriend to tell her friends they're dating. He's frustrated because she hasn't done so, and when he brings it up, she reacts negatively. He's seeking validation on whether he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been dating for three years, including a past breakup and reconciliation. The girlfriend hasn't told her friends about the relationship, only her family. The author is upset because he wants her to be open about their relationship, especially since his friends already know, and he wants to post pictures and have a public presence. He gives her a deadline, which causes a conflict. She responds by deflecting and accusing him of not being truthful about other things.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. Setting boundaries in a relationship is normal, especially regarding privacy and public acknowledgment. The issue here is whether the deadline is reasonable. Three years is a long time, and if the author feels it's important for her to be open with her friends, having a timeline makes sense. However, the way he communicated it might be abrupt. Demanding a deadline without considering her possible reasons for hesitation could be problematic. Maybe she's struggling with something else or fears how her friends will react. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of confrontation might have been too harsh.\n\nAlso, the fact that she didn't inform her friends after getting back together is a point. She told them they split but not that they reconciled, which could imply she's been inconsistent. However, the author's response of turning it into an ultimatum might have been a mistake. Instead of a deadline, discussing her reservations and working together on a solution could have been better. The girlfriend's defensive reaction suggests she felt accused, which might be a result of the ultimatum approach.\n\nAnother angle is the long-distance aspect. In long-distance relationships, communication is crucial, and both parties might need to compromise. The author wants recognition from her friends, which is understandable, but the girlfriend might have her reasons for not sharing. The author's approach might not address her feelings or reasons, leading to her defensiveness.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both have valid points. The author has a right to want the relationship to be acknowledged, but the girlfriend might have her own concerns. However, setting a deadline without understanding her perspective could be seen as controlling. It's possible the author is in the wrong if the deadline was too strict or if he didn't consider her feelings. On the other hand, if the girlfriend's refusal to disclose is causing ongoing issues, the author's stance is understandable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The key is whether the deadline was reasonable and communicated respectfully. If the author gave her time to explain and set the boundary calmly, that's one thing. But if it was abrupt and without empathy, that's another. The girlfriend's reaction of deflecting to unrelated issues (like the author not telling her about parties) might indicate she's uncomfortable with the confrontation and trying to avoid discussing the real issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's desire for openness is valid, enforcing a deadline without understanding her perspective might be where he's in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and communication, and jumping to an ultimatum could be the problem here. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his approach might have been too harsh without considering her feelings or reasons.\n"
