So I (28F) met a guy (35M), we really got on, he was such a gentlemen then on our 4th date we decided to have a marathon of Game of a Thrones in preparation for season 8. So I went to his house for the first time.\n\nWe ended up falling asleep on the sofa, so we then went to bed, it was pretty late and I was exhausted, and I just really didn\u2019t want sex, like really didn\u2019t want sex. So I figured when we went to bed and I simply went to sleep, he would have figured I didn\u2019t want sex, right? \n\nHe woke me up about an hour later really pissed off saying \u201cdo you have a rule or something, because if you do I should know about it? You have made me feel really shit and blown my self esteem completely\u201d, so I told him I just wasn\u2019t ready, he reaaallly didn\u2019t appreciate me saying this, apparently I should have said before the date???? \n\nLike seriously? Is it a rule to decide before a date if you are going to have sex or not?! I\u2019m trying to explain to him before the date I hadn\u2019t ruled out sex all together, I was just going to see how we got on and where the night led. I told him it was all a bit odd that he got angry about it, but he\u2019s fumingggg. \n\nEither way, roll on watching season 8 alone haha!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman who didn't have sex on the fourth date and didn't explain her reasoning until after the guy woke her up angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman went to his house, they fell asleep, and she went to bed without having sex. He woke up angry because he felt confused and it hurt his self-esteem. She thought he would understand from her actions that she wasn't interested in sex that night. He expected her to communicate her boundaries beforehand.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. Even if she didn't want to have sex, maybe she should have made it clear before they went to bed. However, the man's reaction seems extreme. Getting angry and upset about not being told might indicate he had high expectations and didn't read the situation correctly. She might not be in the wrong because she didn't have an obligation to explain her decision after the fact if she felt it was clear from her actions. But maybe there's a middle ground where communication could have been better. Still, his reaction is more about his own expectations and not respecting her choice. So, probably, she's not in the wrong.\n"
