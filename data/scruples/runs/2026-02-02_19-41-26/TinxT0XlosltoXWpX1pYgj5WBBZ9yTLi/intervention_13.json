So I (28F) met a guy (35M), we really got on, he was such a gentlemen then on our 4th date we decided to have a marathon of Game of a Thrones in preparation for season 8. So I went to his house for the first time.\n\nWe ended up falling asleep on the sofa, so we then went to bed, it was pretty late and I was exhausted, and I just really didn\u2019t want sex, like really didn\u2019t want sex. So I figured when we went to bed and I simply went to sleep, he would have figured I didn\u2019t want sex, right? \n\nHe woke me up about an hour later really pissed off saying \u201cdo you have a rule or something, because if you do I should know about it? You have made me feel really shit and blown my self esteem completely\u201d, so I told him I just wasn\u2019t ready, he reaaallly didn\u2019t appreciate me saying this, apparently I should have said before the date???? \n\nLike seriously? Is it a rule to decide before a date if you are going to have sex or not?! I\u2019m trying to explain to him before the date I hadn\u2019t ruled out sex all together, I was just going to see how we got on and where the night led. I told him it was all a bit odd that he got angry about it, but he\u2019s fumingggg. \n\nEither way, roll on watching season 8 alone haha!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the woman (the author) was in the wrong for not explaining she wasn't interested in sex during their fourth date. She went to his house, they fell asleep, and he got upset when she didn't have sex with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The guy felt hurt and confused because he assumed that going to his house meant they would have sex. The woman, on the other hand, thought that if she just went to sleep, he would understand she wasn't interested. But he didn't get the message and took it personally.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the woman was wrong for not being explicit about her boundaries. In many relationships, it's important to communicate preferences and boundaries clearly to avoid misunderstandings. The woman might argue that she wasn't ready, but the guy felt that his expectations weren't met because she didn't set clear expectations beforehand. \n\nHowever, the situation is a bit nuanced. The woman might not have realized that her actions (going to bed without setting boundaries) could be misinterpreted. The guy's reaction was also possibly disproportionate, but his feelings are valid because he felt rejected and confused. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a communication breakdown. The woman didn't explicitly state her boundaries, which could be seen as a failure to communicate her needs. But the guy's reaction was also excessive given the context. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would lean towards her not being in the wrong because she wasn't obligated to have sex and didn't have malicious intent. However, there's a case for her needing to communicate better. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural or social expectations. In some views, not setting expectations before a date is a mistake. But in others, it's the guy's responsibility to read the situation better.\n\nSo, considering the options, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because she didn't have an obligation to explain, but there's a valid point about communication. However, the main issue is the guy's reaction being unreasonable, so the author isn't at fault.\n"
