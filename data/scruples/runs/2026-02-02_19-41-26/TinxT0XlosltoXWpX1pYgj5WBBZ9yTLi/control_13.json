So I (28F) met a guy (35M), we really got on, he was such a gentlemen then on our 4th date we decided to have a marathon of Game of a Thrones in preparation for season 8. So I went to his house for the first time.\n\nWe ended up falling asleep on the sofa, so we then went to bed, it was pretty late and I was exhausted, and I just really didn\u2019t want sex, like really didn\u2019t want sex. So I figured when we went to bed and I simply went to sleep, he would have figured I didn\u2019t want sex, right? \n\nHe woke me up about an hour later really pissed off saying \u201cdo you have a rule or something, because if you do I should know about it? You have made me feel really shit and blown my self esteem completely\u201d, so I told him I just wasn\u2019t ready, he reaaallly didn\u2019t appreciate me saying this, apparently I should have said before the date???? \n\nLike seriously? Is it a rule to decide before a date if you are going to have sex or not?! I\u2019m trying to explain to him before the date I hadn\u2019t ruled out sex all together, I was just going to see how we got on and where the night led. I told him it was all a bit odd that he got angry about it, but he\u2019s fumingggg. \n\nEither way, roll on watching season 8 alone haha!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a woman who met a guy, and on their fourth date, they ended up at his house and fell asleep. She didn't want sex and just went to sleep, thinking that was clear. The guy got upset later because she didn't explain her boundaries beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. The guy felt his self-esteem was hurt because he wasn't informed. Did she have a duty to explain her boundaries before the date? Well, she mentioned she wasn't sure about sex before the date and was going to see how the night went. That seems reasonable, but maybe the guy had different expectations. \n\nIn many cases, open communication is key. If he had talked to her about his expectations earlier, maybe this wouldn't have happened. However, she didn't explicitly say \"no\" before the date. But she also didn't signal she wanted sex. She fell asleep and didn't engage in any sexual activity. The key here is whether non-verbal cues (like just going to bed and sleeping) are enough. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's not in the wrong because she didn't push for sex, and she wasn't sure herself. The guy's reaction seems over the top, getting angry and feeling devalued. Her answer was honest\u2014she wasn't ready. \n\nSo, the answer is B. She's not wrong for not explaining before the date. The guy should have been more communicative about his expectations and respected her boundaries once he realized. She didn't have an obligation to set rules before every date, especially since they were only on the fourth date. It's about mutual respect and understanding.\n"
