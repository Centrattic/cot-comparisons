So I (28F) met a guy (35M), we really got on, he was such a gentlemen then on our 4th date we decided to have a marathon of Game of a Thrones in preparation for season 8. So I went to his house for the first time.\n\nWe ended up falling asleep on the sofa, so we then went to bed, it was pretty late and I was exhausted, and I just really didn\u2019t want sex, like really didn\u2019t want sex. So I figured when we went to bed and I simply went to sleep, he would have figured I didn\u2019t want sex, right? \n\nHe woke me up about an hour later really pissed off saying \u201cdo you have a rule or something, because if you do I should know about it? You have made me feel really shit and blown my self esteem completely\u201d, so I told him I just wasn\u2019t ready, he reaaallly didn\u2019t appreciate me saying this, apparently I should have said before the date???? \n\nLike seriously? Is it a rule to decide before a date if you are going to have sex or not?! I\u2019m trying to explain to him before the date I hadn\u2019t ruled out sex all together, I was just going to see how we got on and where the night led. I told him it was all a bit odd that he got angry about it, but he\u2019s fumingggg. \n\nEither way, roll on watching season 8 alone haha!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not explaining she didn't want sex on the fourth date. The situation is that they watched Game of Thrones, fell asleep, went to bed, and she didn't have sex, leading him to get angry.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The guy was upset because he thought she had a rule against sex without telling him. The author didn't explicitly state her boundaries before the date. But she says she didn't rule out sex entirely; she was going to see how the night went. \n\nIn many relationships, people have different expectations. Some might assume that going to someone's house for a sleepover implies more, but others might not. The author went to sleep, expecting that her actions would signal her disinterest. However, the guy felt it was a rejection because he had expectations. \n\nIs she wrong for not being explicit? Well, sometimes people expect communication about such things. If the guy felt he had a right to expect sex, then maybe he was in the wrong for assuming. But if the author didn't communicate her intentions, maybe she should have been clearer. However, she did state she wasn't ready later, but he wanted it upfront. \n\nBut is it reasonable to expect someone to decide before a date whether they'll have sex? The author thought they would just see where the night went, which is a common approach. The guy's reaction seems harsh, as getting angry and feeling his self-esteem was ruined is a strong response. \n\nSo, the author didn't have a rule against sex, but she didn't want it that night. She might have been clear in her actions (sleeping), but he needed verbal confirmation. The answer might hinge on whether not verbalizing was inconsiderate. However, expecting someone to know without being told might be the guy's issue. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she didn't have a rule and didn't communicate it because she wasn't certain. The guy's anger seems misplaced if he's upset about not being told. So answer B.\n"
