So I (28F) met a guy (35M), we really got on, he was such a gentlemen then on our 4th date we decided to have a marathon of Game of a Thrones in preparation for season 8. So I went to his house for the first time.\n\nWe ended up falling asleep on the sofa, so we then went to bed, it was pretty late and I was exhausted, and I just really didn\u2019t want sex, like really didn\u2019t want sex. So I figured when we went to bed and I simply went to sleep, he would have figured I didn\u2019t want sex, right? \n\nHe woke me up about an hour later really pissed off saying \u201cdo you have a rule or something, because if you do I should know about it? You have made me feel really shit and blown my self esteem completely\u201d, so I told him I just wasn\u2019t ready, he reaaallly didn\u2019t appreciate me saying this, apparently I should have said before the date???? \n\nLike seriously? Is it a rule to decide before a date if you are going to have sex or not?! I\u2019m trying to explain to him before the date I hadn\u2019t ruled out sex all together, I was just going to see how we got on and where the night led. I told him it was all a bit odd that he got angry about it, but he\u2019s fumingggg. \n\nEither way, roll on watching season 8 alone haha!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the woman is in the wrong for not explaining she didn't want sex on the fourth date. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they were on a movie marathon, fell asleep on the couch, then went to bed. She didn't want sex, so she just went to sleep. He got upset later because she didn't set boundaries earlier. He felt she made him feel bad and hurt his self-esteem. She argues that she didn't have a rule and expected him to understand when she went to sleep. He thought she should have communicated before the date.\n\nHmm. Communication is key in relationships. Even if she didn't want to have sex, maybe she should have discussed her feelings before things escalated. However, the situation happened when they were already in bed. Maybe she didn't think he would misinterpret her actions. But from his perspective, he might have expected a clear communication. On the other hand, expecting someone to communicate before a date might be too much if they weren't certain. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the woman isn't entirely wrong because she didn't force anything, but maybe she could have been clearer. However, the man's reaction seems a bit extreme. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
