So I (28F) met a guy (35M), we really got on, he was such a gentlemen then on our 4th date we decided to have a marathon of Game of a Thrones in preparation for season 8. So I went to his house for the first time.\n\nWe ended up falling asleep on the sofa, so we then went to bed, it was pretty late and I was exhausted, and I just really didn\u2019t want sex, like really didn\u2019t want sex. So I figured when we went to bed and I simply went to sleep, he would have figured I didn\u2019t want sex, right? \n\nHe woke me up about an hour later really pissed off saying \u201cdo you have a rule or something, because if you do I should know about it? You have made me feel really shit and blown my self esteem completely\u201d, so I told him I just wasn\u2019t ready, he reaaallly didn\u2019t appreciate me saying this, apparently I should have said before the date???? \n\nLike seriously? Is it a rule to decide before a date if you are going to have sex or not?! I\u2019m trying to explain to him before the date I hadn\u2019t ruled out sex all together, I was just going to see how we got on and where the night led. I told him it was all a bit odd that he got angry about it, but he\u2019s fumingggg. \n\nEither way, roll on watching season 8 alone haha!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author (28F) is in the wrong for not explaining she didn't want sex on the fourth date. The situation is that she went to his house, they fell asleep on the couch, then went to bed. She went to sleep and didn't have sex. He got angry later, saying she should have communicated her boundaries beforehand.\n\nHmm, first, communication is key in relationships. But the question is whether she was wrong for not explicitly stating her intentions before the date. She mentioned she hadn't ruled out sex but wanted to see how the night went. He expected a rule, like a clear boundary set beforehand.\n\nI think the issue here is about expectations and communication. She might have assumed that her actions (falling asleep immediately) would signal her lack of interest. But he felt that she should have communicated this clearly before the date. From his perspective, being left in the dark might have made him feel rejected or confused. However, she might not have intended to give mixed signals. \n\nBut is she at fault? Well, if there's a mutual understanding that boundaries should be discussed before such situations, then maybe she should have been more upfront. However, in many relationships, especially early on, people might not communicate every possible detail. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nOn one hand, he's upset because he felt blindsided. On the other, she might not have felt the need to specify since they were both in a new relationship. The key point is whether there was a prior expectation or discussion about boundaries. If there wasn't, maybe both parties are at fault for not communicating clearly. But the question is specifically about her. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the reader believes that setting clear boundaries before a potentially intimate date is necessary. If the answer is yes, then she's in the wrong. If not, then she's not. \n\nI'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong. Because while better communication could have helped, it's not necessarily her fault if he expected a rule that wasn't previously discussed. She was honest afterward, and the situation was a bit ambiguous. Expecting someone to set a rule before the date might be too much in an early stage relationship unless there were prior discussions about expectations. So B.\n"
