But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them not wanting to hold a coworker's baby after experiencing a personal loss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They've gone through a significant emotional trauma\u2014the loss of their baby. That's a heavy burden, and it's affecting their ability to interact with babies. They're not faking this; it's a genuine emotional response. People often don't understand how grief can linger and change someone's reactions, even if they've made progress.\n\nNow, the coworker's actions: she brings the baby into the office regularly and expects the author to hold the baby. She refuses to take the baby back once he's placed down. That seems a bit entitled. Everyone has boundaries, and the coworker might not be respecting the author's. The author tried to set a boundary by declining, but when that didn't work, they put the baby down. The baby is walking, so it's not like it's a risk. But the coworker got angry.\n\nThe author's response was to set the baby down, which is a reasonable action if they're not comfortable holding. However, maybe there was a better way to handle it. For example, explaining their feelings to the coworker once, so she understands and respects the boundary in the future. But in the moment, the author did what they felt they had to do to stay comfortable.\n\nThe coworker's reaction is also a factor. If she's insistent and doesn't respect the author's no, that's on her. The author isn't obligated to comply with social expectations if it causes them pain. However, maybe there's a middle ground\u2014like agreeing to hold the baby once in a while when they feel up to it. But the key here is that the author is trying to protect their mental health.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for having their feelings and setting a boundary. The coworker is in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. The author's action of setting the baby down was a way to enforce the boundary when the coworker didn't back off. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
