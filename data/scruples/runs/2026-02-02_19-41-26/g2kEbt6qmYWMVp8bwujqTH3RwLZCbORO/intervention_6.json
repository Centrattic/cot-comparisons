But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to hold babies after experiencing a loss. The author explains that they used to love babies but now find it painful because it reminds them of their loss. The coworker keeps bringing her grandkids to work and insists the author hold the baby, which the author declines. The coworker gets angry when the author puts the baby down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They've gone through a significant emotional trauma\u2014the loss of their baby. This is a valid reason for their feelings. Trauma can change how someone reacts to certain stimuli, like babies. It's understandable that they might not want to interact with them anymore. They're not trying to be rude; they're dealing with their grief.\n\nHowever, the coworker's perspective is also important. The author mentions that the coworker \"parades\" the grandkids around and \"shoves the baby into their arms.\" The coworker might not realize the emotional impact this has on the author. But when the author finally says no and sets the baby down, the coworker gets angry. The author put the baby down on the floor, but since the baby can walk, it wasn't dangerous. The coworker didn't take the baby back, which might have forced the author into an uncomfortable situation again.\n\nThe key question here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate. While the author has a valid reason for their discomfort, the way they handled the situation could be seen as abrupt. Direct communication might have been better. Instead of setting the baby down without warning, the author could have explained their feelings more clearly. The coworker might not have understood the depth of the author's trauma, leading to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. They shouldn't have to force themselves into uncomfortable situations. The coworker's insistence on holding the baby, despite the author's previous discomfort, could be seen as inconsiderate as well. The coworker might not have been empathetic to the author's situation.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the action of putting the baby down was the wrong move. Since the baby was old enough to walk, the action wasn't harmful. However, the author could have communicated better. Maybe the coworker felt disrespected because the author didn't explain again. The author's justification is valid, but their method might have lacked communication. Therefore, it's a nuanced situation where both parties have some fault, but the author's intent wasn't malicious. The coworker's reaction might be overly harsh given the author's circumstances. So, while the author could have handled it more gracefully, they aren't entirely in the wrong because their actions were self-preservation after trauma.\n"
