But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they lost a baby and now don't want to hold babies because it's too painful. Their coworker keeps bringing a baby to the office and expects them to hold it. Today, the author refused and set the baby down on the floor. The coworker got angry. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to hold the baby\u2014grief and trauma from losing their own child. That's a heavy thing to carry, and it's understandable that being around babies is a constant reminder of their loss. They mention that they tried to avoid this before by not talking about it, but the coworker kept pushing. Now they snapped and set the baby down, which the coworker didn't like.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker was parading the baby around and not taking it back when the author refused. That part is a bit iffy. If the coworker is the one who insisted on holding the baby and then refused to take it back, that's part of the problem. But when the author finally says no and sets the baby down, maybe they should have found a better way to handle it. Letting the baby walk off on the floor might not have been the best approach, especially if the coworker was upset. But the baby can walk, so maybe it wasn't dangerous. Still, the coworker feels disrespected.\n\nThe author's intention was to protect their own mental health, which is important. But the way they handled it caused conflict. Maybe they could have communicated better, like explaining their feelings to the coworker earlier or finding a different solution when the baby was brought in. However, the coworker's actions of repeatedly bringing the baby and not respecting the author's boundaries also contributed to the situation. \n\nSo, the author's action of setting the baby down was maybe a bit impulsive and could have been handled more thoughtfully. But considering their trauma, it's a reaction to a lot of pressure. The coworker's part in not respecting the author's previous discomfort is also part of the issue. The key is whether the author's action was justified given their circumstances. While the method might be questionable, the underlying reason is valid. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it better. But the question is if they are in the wrong. The answer might be a nuanced B, not in the wrong, but with some caveats.\n"
