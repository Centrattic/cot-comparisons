But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves someone who lost a baby and now doesn't want to hold babies. The coworker keeps pushing a baby on them, and the author ends up setting the baby down, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author has experienced a significant loss, which affects their emotional state. They mention that being around babies is painful for them. It's important to validate that grief can have long-term effects, and people have different ways of coping. So, it's not just about being rude; there's a genuine emotional struggle here.\n\nThen there's the interaction with the coworker. The coworker seems to be overstepping by constantly bringing the baby to work and not respecting the author's boundaries. The author tried to set a boundary by saying they don't want to hold the baby, but the coworker didn't take it seriously. The coworker even refused to take the baby back after the author placed him down, which is problematic. The coworker's actions come off as dismissive and possibly insensitive.\n\nThe actual action in question is the author placing the baby on the floor. The baby can walk, so it's not like they were left alone. The author made sure the baby was safe. The coworker's anger seems misplaced here. The author was within their rights to refuse, especially after previous instances where their boundaries weren't respected. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back forced the author into a situation where they had to act to resolve it, which might be justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common to expect people to hold babies, it's not a requirement. People have different comfort levels. The coworker's behavior of \"parading\" the kids around and not respecting the author's wishes is more concerning. The author's action, though maybe not the most tactful, was a response to ongoing pressure and boundary violations.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's grief is a valid reason for their feelings. The coworker's actions were inconsiderate and dismissive. The author's response, while it might seem abrupt, was a reaction to a pattern of behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
