But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who lost a baby last year, not wanting to hold a coworker's grandchild. The coworker got angry when the author refused and even set the baby down, leading to the coworker's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing a baby. It's understandable that being around babies is painful for them. They mention not wanting to force themselves into uncomfortable situations, which is a valid emotional boundary. The coworker, however, seemed to push and didn't respect that boundary, as she kept bringing the baby to the office and insisted the author hold him, even when they declined.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author tried to communicate their discomfort but the coworker didn't back off. When the author set the baby down, the coworker reacted negatively. However, the baby could walk, so placing him on the floor wasn't dangerous. The author might have handled the situation better by explaining their feelings more clearly, but the coworker's actions in not respecting the decline and getting angry could also be problematic.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's actions were a response to their grief and discomfort, which is a legitimate reason. However, setting the baby down without the parent's consent might be seen as crossing a line, even if the baby could walk. The coworker's reaction, while perhaps harsh, stems from a different perspective where the author's refusal is hurtful.\n\nBut considering the author's trauma and the coworker's lack of respect for boundaries, the blame isn't entirely on the author. They might not be in the wrong. The coworker should have respected the author's wishes more. However, the act of putting the baby down without permission could be seen as the author's fault, depending on the situation. It's a tricky balance between personal boundaries and respecting others' feelings.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong, because their actions were a result of grief and they tried to communicate their discomfort. The coworker's behavior was more about not respecting boundaries.\n"
