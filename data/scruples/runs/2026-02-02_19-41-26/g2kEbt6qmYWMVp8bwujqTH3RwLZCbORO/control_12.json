But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about someone who lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them anymore, but a coworker keeps pushing it, and when they refused, the coworker got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a legitimate reason for not wanting to hold babies\u2014they're dealing with grief and trauma from losing their own baby. That's a valid emotional response. People often don't realize how triggering certain situations can be for someone who's experienced loss. The author is also being honest about their feelings, which is important for their mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's reaction is also a factor. The coworker seems to be inconsiderate of the author's feelings. If the coworker knew about the author's loss, she might not have pushed so hard. But there's a question here about whether the author communicated their boundaries effectively. Did they make their coworkers aware of their situation? The author mentions people get offended when they don't show interest, so maybe they haven't communicated the reason behind their refusal clearly. \n\nThe specific incident where the author sets the baby down on the floor might be the point in question. The coworker is upset because the baby was left with the author for several minutes and then put down. But the author explains that they set the baby down on his feet since he can walk. So, it's not like the baby was in danger. The coworker's refusal to take him back is part of the problem here. The author's action of setting the baby down could be seen as a way to end the uncomfortable situation, especially if the coworker wasn't willing to take him back immediately. \n\nHowever, from the coworker's perspective, maybe she felt the author was being rude or inconsiderate to the child. But given the author's history, there's a valid emotional reason. The key factors are whether the author communicated their boundaries and if their actions were respectful. Since the author mentions they don't want to force themselves beyond their comfort zone and have come a long way, it's about respecting their mental health.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people often expect others to engage with babies, but grief is a personal journey. The coworker's reaction might stem from not understanding the author's trauma. The author isn't in the wrong if they're honest about their feelings and act in a way that protects their well-being, as long as they're not harming others. The coworker should have been more respectful and not forced the author into holding the baby if they were aware of the loss. The fact that the author set the baby down gently and the child was okay is important here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their actions, and the coworker's behavior seems more inconsiderate. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
