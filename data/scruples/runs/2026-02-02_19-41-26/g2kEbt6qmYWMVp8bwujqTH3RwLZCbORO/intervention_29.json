But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after refusing to hold a baby and setting it down on the floor. The author has a history of losing a baby, which makes them avoid babies now. They felt uncomfortable when their coworker forced them to hold the baby and eventually set the child down. The coworker was upset, but the author argues the baby could walk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author's trauma from losing a child is valid, and it's understandable that they might feel pain around babies. However, the way they handled the situation might be problematic. Setting a baby down on the floor, even if the child can walk, could be seen as dismissive or uncaring. The coworker might have felt disrespected, especially if she didn't pick up the baby again. \n\nBut the coworker's actions in parading the baby around and insisting on holding it might have been overbearing. The author's right to set boundaries is important. However, the method they used\u2014setting the baby down instead of politely declining or stepping away\u2014might have been inappropriate. It's a balance between respecting their own feelings and the other person's expectations.\n\nAlso, the coworker's reaction might be part of the issue. If she was insistent and didn't respect the author's previous boundaries, she shares some responsibility. But the author could have handled it more gracefully, perhaps by explaining their discomfort or asking to not be involved without being abrupt.\n\nIn terms of social norms, holding a baby is often seen as a kind gesture, and refusing can be sensitive. However, the author's mental health and trauma should be considered. The key is whether the action was harmful. Putting a walking baby down isn't dangerous, but the manner might have been insensitive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They have valid reasons, but the way they handled it might have crossed a line. The coworker's actions were also problematic. The answer depends on whether the action was disrespectful. Since the baby could walk, setting them down isn't harmful, but the context of the coworker's insistence complicates things. The author might not be in the wrong if they communicated their boundaries, but the act of setting the baby down without explanation could be seen as rude. However, given the trauma, maybe it's not entirely their fault. \n\nHmm. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the author had valid reasons and the coworker was pushing boundaries. But some might say A because of the method used. Need to decide based on the situation's nuances.\n"
