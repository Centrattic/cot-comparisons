But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user (AITA) lost a baby last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them or interact with them because it reminds them of their loss. People, including coworkers, expect them to interact with babies, but the coworker in question insists on giving a baby to the author, even when the author refuses. The coworker then gets angry when the author sets the baby down on the floor, even though the baby can walk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's situation. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing a child. Their aversion to babies is a valid emotional response. It's important to acknowledge that grief can affect people differently, and some might avoid triggers that remind them of their loss.\n\nNow, looking at the coworker's actions. The coworker has grandchildren who visit the office weekly and insists on giving the baby to the author despite their refusal. This seems inconsiderate. The coworker is not respecting the author's boundaries and is forcing interaction, which is the opposite of being empathetic towards someone's grief.\n\nThe author tried to communicate their discomfort, which is the right approach. However, when the coworker didn't take the baby back, the author set the baby down. The coworker then got angry. The key point here is whether the author crossed a line by setting the baby down. Since the baby can walk, putting them on the floor isn't dangerous. However, maybe the coworker felt disrespected because the author didn't want to hold the baby, and the coworker might have felt embarrassed or upset.\n\nBut the main issue is that the author is dealing with personal grief and is within their rights to set boundaries. The coworker, on the other hand, should have respected the author's wishes from the start. The fact that the coworker refused to take the baby back when the author declined is problematic. The author had no other option but to set the baby down to avoid further discomfort, especially since the coworker was being pushy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected that people respect others' boundaries. If someone says they don't want to hold a baby, the person should take that as a final answer. The coworker's reaction of anger is also inappropriate, especially because the author was honest about their feelings and the situation was handled with care (the baby wasn't harmed).\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is not in the wrong because they communicated their needs and acted within their rights to avoid emotional distress. The coworker failed to respect those boundaries and overreacted when the author set the baby down. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
