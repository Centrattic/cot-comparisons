But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lost a baby last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them or talk about them, which makes people uncomfortable. The coworker keeps bringing grandchildren to the office and insists the author hold the baby. Today, the author refused, and when the coworker didn't take the baby back, they put it on the floor, and the kid walked off. The coworker was angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma after losing their baby. It's understandable that being around babies is triggering for them. They've made it clear they don't want to be around babies, but people don't respect that. The coworker's actions seem inconsiderate, pushing the baby into the author's arms repeatedly. The author tried to set boundaries, but the coworker didn't honor them. When the author put the baby down (since it could walk), the coworker was upset. But the baby wasn't hurt, right? The author didn't drop it or anything; they just set it on the floor. The coworker didn't take the baby back, so the author had to act to get out of the situation.\n\nBut wait, is putting a baby on the floor acceptable? Even if the baby can walk, maybe it's not the best action. Maybe the coworker's reaction was harsh, but the author's action might have been a bit abrupt. However, the coworker was the one forcing the situation in the first place. The author's trauma is valid, and they have the right to set boundaries. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back forced the author's hand. So, the coworker's behavior is probably worse here. The author was trying to protect their own mental health. But maybe the way they handled it was not the best approach. However, considering the circumstances, the coworker's actions were more inconsiderate. So the author isn't the asshole. Answer B.\n"
