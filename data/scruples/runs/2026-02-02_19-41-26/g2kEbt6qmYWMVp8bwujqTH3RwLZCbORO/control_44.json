But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong in not wanting to hold babies after a personal loss. The author lost their baby last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. People, especially a coworker with grandchildren, expect them to interact, but the author is uncomfortable. Today, when the coworker insisted they hold a baby, the author refused and put the baby down, leading the coworker to be angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's situation. They're dealing with grief, which is a valid and personal experience. Their reaction to babies being painful is understandable. The key here is their right to set boundaries after a traumatic loss. The coworker's actions\u2014parading the grandkids around and forcing the author to hold the baby\u2014might be overstepping. The author didn't just drop the baby; they set it down on the floor where it could walk, which wasn't a danger. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back and the anger could be the real issue here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were to protect their emotional well-being. While the coworker might feel slighted, the author isn't obligated to feign interest in something that triggers their grief. The coworker's response was more about their own expectations rather than respecting the author's boundaries. So, the author is not in the wrong for asserting their comfort zone, especially given their history.\n"
