But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author lost a baby and now feels uncomfortable around babies, which is understandable. They mention not wanting to hold the coworker's grandbaby, leading to a conflict where the coworker got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. Grieving is a personal process, and it's valid for them to feel pain around reminders of their loss. They tried to avoid the situation by not holding the baby, which makes sense. However, the coworker kept pushing, which might be a cultural expectation to engage with babies, but the author is making a personal boundary.\n\nThen there's the action where the author set the baby down on the floor. The coworker was upset because she didn't take the baby back, so the author had to place him elsewhere. But putting a walking baby on the floor might not be safe, even though the baby could walk. The coworker's reaction is about the author not respecting her request to hold the baby, while the author felt pressured and acted to remove themselves from the situation.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have a valid reason for their feelings, but setting the baby down without consulting the coworker could be seen as abrupt. However, the coworker was the one forcing the interaction, not allowing the author to say no. The key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable way to handle a situation they were uncomfortable in. If the coworker kept pushing despite the author's refusal, the author might be justified in removing the baby to avoid further discomfort. But maybe there's a better way to handle it, like finding another person to hold the baby. Still, given the context of grief and ongoing pressure from the coworker, the author's actions could be seen as a last resort. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has a valid reason and was trying to set a boundary, even if the method wasn't perfect.\n"
