But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to hold the baby after losing their own. The situation is that the coworker keeps bringing the baby by and forcing the author to hold it, but the author sets the baby down because it's too painful. The coworker got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They lost a baby and are still dealing with the grief. They find it painful to be around babies now. It's natural for them to avoid situations that trigger their sadness. They didn't force themselves to be uncomfortable, which is understandable. They tried to set boundaries by saying no, but the coworker didn't respect that. Then the coworker left the baby with the author, so the author had to set the baby down. The coworker got angry, but the baby can walk, so setting him on the floor wasn't dangerous.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might have felt hurt or offended because people usually expect to hold babies. But she also kept bringing the baby around despite the author's discomfort. Maybe she didn't realize the impact of her actions. The author's action of setting the baby down might have been abrupt, but given the context of grief, it's a defensive move. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back and getting angry seems unfair, especially since she initially forced the situation.\n\nSo, the author isn't at fault here because they have a valid reason for their actions. The coworker didn't respect boundaries and overreacted. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
