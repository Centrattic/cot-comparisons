But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author used to love babies but after losing their own baby, they can't stand being around them. They find it painful and it's a reminder of their loss. Now, when people expect them to hold babies or talk to them, they avoid it, which makes people upset. The coworker keeps bringing her grandkids into the office and insists the author hold the baby, but the author finally snaps and sets the baby down, which the coworker takes as offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid reason for not wanting to hold babies\u2014grief over losing their own child. That's a significant emotional trauma. It's understandable that being around babies triggers painful memories. They've tried to handle it by avoiding, but the coworker isn't respecting their boundaries. Setting the baby down might seem harsh, but the context is important.\n\nThen the coworker's reaction. She's bringing the kids into the office frequently and expecting people to interact. When the author refuses, she gets angry and doesn't take the baby back. The author then puts the baby down, which the coworker is upset about. The coworker might be inconsiderate if she's forcing interactions on someone who's grieving. However, the author's action of setting the baby down without warning could be seen as abrupt. But the baby can walk, so maybe it's not as dangerous as it sounds.\n\nLegally, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're not responsible for the baby's safety in that moment. But socially, there's a question about how to handle the coworker's expectations. The author's mental health is a factor here. They have a right to their boundaries. The coworker might need to be more sensitive, but the author's method of setting the baby down could have been handled better. Maybe they should have asked the coworker to take the baby or explain their feelings. However, the coworker wasn't willing to take the baby back, so the author had to act quickly.\n\nIn terms of social norms, forcing someone to hold a baby when they're not comfortable is not okay. The coworker's behavior is part of the problem. The author's action was a reaction to being pushed beyond their comfort zone. The baby wasn't harmed, so the author isn't at fault. The coworker's anger seems misplaced given the author's history. So, the author isn't the asshole here; the coworker's lack of empathy is the issue. The answer should be B.\n"
