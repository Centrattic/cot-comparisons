But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who, after experiencing a miscarriage, now finds it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them or interact, but people keep expecting them to, which causes discomfort. The key incident is when they refuse to hold a baby and set it down on the floor instead of holding it longer, leading to conflict with a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's trauma from losing a baby is a significant factor here. Their feelings are valid, and they're dealing with grief. However, the action in question is putting the baby on the floor instead of handing it back. The coworker was the one who kept the baby with the author for several minutes and then refused to take it back. The author sets the baby down on the floor, which the coworker then gets angry about.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the baby can walk, so setting it down isn't dangerous. But the act of placing a baby on the floor instead of returning it might be seen as abrupt. However, the coworker was the one who initially forced the interaction by not taking the baby back. The author clearly stated their discomfort, so the coworker's persistence could be at fault here. The author's action was a way to end the uncomfortable situation, but maybe they could have handled it more gracefully, like asking the coworker to take the baby. Still, given the trauma and the coworker's behavior, the author's boundaries might be justified. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a more appropriate way to handle it without offending others. However, the coworker's anger might be misplaced given the author's valid reasons. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
