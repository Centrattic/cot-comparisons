But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to hold the baby and setting it down instead of holding it. \n\nFirst, let's look at the context. The author lost a baby last year and has been struggling with the grief. They used to love babies but now find it painful to be around them. People, including coworkers, expect them to interact with babies, which is causing discomfort. The coworker in question keeps bringing the baby to the office and insists the author hold it, even when the author is uncomfortable. The author finally sets the baby down on the floor, which makes the coworker angry.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respecting personal boundaries and the well-being of the author. The author is dealing with trauma and grief, which is a valid reason to not want to engage in certain situations. They tried to communicate their discomfort but the coworker didn't take it seriously. The author's action of setting the baby down might seem abrupt, but the baby can walk, so it's not a dangerous situation. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back and the author's action in response might be a clash between cultural expectations (people often want to hold babies) and the author's personal needs.\n\nIs the author at fault? They did communicate their refusal, and the coworker didn't respect that boundary. The author's action could be seen as a way to remove themselves from an uncomfortable situation, even if it wasn't the most graceful. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like asking someone else to hold the baby. But given the context of their grief, it's understandable they're not in the mood. The coworker's reaction is also a problem because pushing someone to hold a baby when they're uncomfortable isn't respectful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their actions, and the coworker didn't respect their boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
