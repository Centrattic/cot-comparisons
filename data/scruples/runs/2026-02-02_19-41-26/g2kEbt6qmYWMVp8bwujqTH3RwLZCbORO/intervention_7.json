But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is dealing with the grief of losing a baby, which is a significant and traumatic event. They mention that being around babies is painful and triggers their sadness. That makes sense emotionally; grief can make certain triggers really hard to handle.\n\nNow, the situation in question is about refusing to hold a baby at work. The coworker keeps bringing the grandchild in, and the author ends up setting the baby down when asked not to hold him. The coworker got angry about that. The key points here are the author's emotional state and the coworker's reaction.\n\nThe author's intention was to avoid discomfort and not push themselves into a situation that's emotionally taxing. They made a choice based on their current mental health needs. However, the action of setting the baby down might have been seen as abrupt or inconsiderate. The coworker was upset, which suggests that the author's action might have been perceived as rude or dismissive, even if it wasn't meant that way.\n\nBut wait, the author did set the baby down carefully, noting that the baby can walk. So it wasn't like they left the baby unattended for long. The coworker was the one who kept the baby with her, then handed it off, and when the author refused, they had to put it down. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back might have been a bigger issue here. The author's action was a direct response to being uncomfortable and trying to set a boundary.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their feelings and boundaries. On the other, in a professional setting, sometimes you have to navigate social expectations, even if they're painful. The coworker might not understand the author's grief and thus saw the refusal as a personal slight. The author might have handled it differently, like politely explaining their situation, but they chose not to because they didn't want to force themselves out of comfort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The intention wasn't to harm or be rude, but the action did upset someone else. The coworker's behavior of repeatedly bringing the baby in and not respecting the refusal might have contributed to the conflict. The author's decision to set the baby down was a way to remove themselves from a stressful situation. Given the context of their grief and the coworker's part in the situation, the author's action seems justified as a boundary. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
