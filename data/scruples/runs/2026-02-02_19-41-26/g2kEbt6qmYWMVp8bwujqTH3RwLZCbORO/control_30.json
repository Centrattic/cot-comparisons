But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the situation: the author lost a baby last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them or talk about them, which upsets others, especially a coworker who keeps forcing a grandchild's baby on them. Today, the author refused to hold the baby, set it on the floor, and the coworker got angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's emotional trauma and the coworker's actions. The author is dealing with grief and is clear about their discomfort. They didn't want to participate in something that causes them pain. On the other hand, the coworker expected the author to engage and got upset when they declined.\n\nBut the coworker also didn't take the baby back immediately and forced the author to hold it. The author then set the baby down on the floor. The coworker's reaction was anger, but maybe she should have considered the author's feelings. \n\nLegally, maybe not, but socially? The author has a valid reason for their discomfort. They're being honest about their feelings. The coworker shouldn't have forced the author to hold the baby in the first place. However, setting the baby down on the floor might be seen as abrupt or insensitive, even if the author had good intentions. But wait, the baby can walk, so maybe it's okay. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back was her problem.\n\nThe author's actions were a response to their own trauma. The coworker's behavior was inconsiderate. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries. The coworker should have respected that from the start. So the answer is B (no).\n"
