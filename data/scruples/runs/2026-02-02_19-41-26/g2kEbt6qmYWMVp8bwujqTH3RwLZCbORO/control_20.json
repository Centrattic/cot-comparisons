But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points here are the author's emotional state after losing a baby and their reaction to a coworker's infant.\n\nFirst, the author explains that they used to love babies but now find it painful to be around them due to their loss. That's a valid emotional response. People grieve differently, and it's important to respect their boundaries. The coworker, however, keeps bringing the baby to work and expects the author to hold them. The author tries to avoid this, which is understandable given their trauma.\n\nThe situation escalates when the author refuses to hold the baby again and sets the child down. The coworker is upset because she didn't take the baby back. The author's action of placing the baby on the floor might be seen as abrupt, but the baby is already walking, so maybe it's not as bad as it sounds. However, putting a child down without the parent's consent could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the child is mobile.\n\nBut the main issue here is the coworker's behavior. She's pressuring the author repeatedly, not respecting their boundaries, and even after the author's refusal, she doesn't take the baby back. The author's right to set their own limits is important here. While the method of placing the baby down might be questionable, the underlying cause is the coworker's lack of empathy towards the author's grief.\n\nSo, considering the context of grief and the coworker's persistent pressure, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. The coworker should have been more understanding and respectful of the author's feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
