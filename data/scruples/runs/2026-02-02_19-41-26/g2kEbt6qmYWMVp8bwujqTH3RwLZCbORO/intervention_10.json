But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. Their coworker keeps bringing grandchildren, including a baby, and insists the author hold it. The author sets the baby down on the floor because they don't want to hold it, and the coworker gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional context. The author is dealing with grief from losing a baby, which is a valid and serious situation. Their feelings are real, and they're trying to avoid triggers that remind them of their loss. That part seems understandable. People should be empathetic towards someone going through such a loss.\n\nHowever, the action in question is setting the baby down on the floor. Even though the author claims the baby can walk, letting a child walk away from someone's arms might be seen as abrupt. The coworker was upset because she expected the author to hold the baby, and the author didn't handle the situation gracefully. \n\nThe coworker's response was also problematic. She \"parades\" the kids around and insists on making the author hold the baby, which isn't considerate of the author's feelings. Still, the author's action of setting the baby down without discussing it might come off as dismissive or rude, regardless of their grief. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting one's boundaries and considering the feelings of others. The author didn't want to hold the baby, which they have the right to, but how they communicated it might have been hurtful. They could have explained their feelings more clearly instead of just setting the baby down. The coworker's behavior was also inconsiderate, but the author's response could have been handled better.\n\nSo, while the author's situation is sympathetic, their action of setting the baby down without explanation might have been the asshole move because it didn't account for the coworker's perspective and could be seen as disrespectful. However, the coworker's insistence on making them hold the baby is also at fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key point is that the author had a valid reason, but handled the situation poorly. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. In some contexts, not holding the baby might be accepted if explained, but the way it was done was abrupt. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be the sole asshole, but they do have some responsibility in how they handled the situation. However, the coworker's behavior was also inconsiderate. The dilemma is whether the author's action, though arising from valid pain, was the asshole move. Considering that the author could have communicated their needs better, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong), but part of me thinks it's not entirely their fault. Hmm.\n"
