But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to hold a baby, especially after experiencing a loss. The situation involves the coworker forcing the baby into their arms and refusing to take them back when the author declines.\n\nFirst, the author's emotional state is key here. They've had a personal trauma with losing a baby, which makes being around babies painful. It's reasonable for someone to avoid triggers that cause them distress, especially if they're still healing. The coworker's actions are problematic because she's not respecting the author's boundaries. Insisting on holding the baby and then being angry when the author refuses shows a lack of empathy and understanding.\n\nThe coworker's behavior of \"parading\" the grandkids around and insisting on holding the baby every time might be inconsiderate. The author isn't forcing the coworker to do anything; they're just setting a boundary. The coworker's anger stems from her own expectations, not considering the author's feelings. Also, the baby was old enough to walk, so setting him on the floor was safe. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back when asked adds to the issue.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while holding babies is a common expectation, it's not mandatory. People should respect others' choices, especially when there's a valid reason. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're protecting their mental health. The coworker's reaction is more about her own actions not being respected. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're setting a boundary in a situation where others aren't showing the necessary sensitivity.\n"
