But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who has experienced a miscarriage, not wanting to hold a coworker's baby. The key points here are the author's emotional state due to their loss, the coworker's insistence on making them hold the baby, and the resulting conflict when the author sets the baby down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing a baby. It's understandable that being around babies is painful for them. They mention that it's not just about holding the baby but even seeing baby-related things is a reminder of their loss. This is a valid emotional response, and forcing someone to interact with something that triggers their grief could be harmful.\n\nNext, the coworker's actions. The coworker insists on having the author hold the baby despite the author's reluctance. The author clearly communicates their refusal, but the coworker doesn't respect that boundary. Then, when the author sets the baby down, the coworker gets angry. The coworker's behavior here seems to be the main issue. Pressuring someone who has already stated their discomfort isn't appropriate. The coworker should have respected the author's wishes instead of pushing the interaction.\n\nThe action of setting the baby down\u2014since the child can walk\u2014is a point of contention. The author didn't drop the baby or put an infant on the floor; they placed a toddler who can walk on the ground. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back might be part of the problem. The author's main issue was being forced into an uncomfortable situation, and their response was to remove themselves from it in a way that wasn't harmful given the child's age.\n\nConsidering social expectations, while it's common to expect people to engage with babies, it's also important to recognize personal boundaries, especially when someone is grieving. The author isn't being inconsiderate of the child but is protecting their own emotional well-being. The coworker's anger stems from not having her expectations met, but the author isn't obligated to comply if it causes them distress.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. Their actions were a necessary boundary to protect their mental health, and the coworker's behavior was disrespectful of that boundary.\n"
