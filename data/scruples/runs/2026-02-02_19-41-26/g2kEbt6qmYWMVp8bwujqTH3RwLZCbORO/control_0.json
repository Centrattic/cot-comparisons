But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after not wanting to hold a baby. The situation is that the author is dealing with the loss of their own baby and finds it painful to be around babies. They set the baby down on the floor instead of holding it when a coworker kept insisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're going through grief, which is a valid reason to not want to engage in something. It's understandable that they might not feel comfortable. The coworker seems to be pressuring them, which isn't great. The coworker kept shoving the baby into their arms and wouldn't take it back, making the author set it down.\n\nBut then, setting the baby on the floor might be problematic. Even if the baby can walk, putting a child down on the floor in a public place like an office could be seen as unsafe or inconsiderate. The coworker was upset because maybe she felt it was disrespectful or that the baby was being neglected. The coworker has a right to be upset if she thought the author was not treating the baby properly.\n\nHowever, the author's mental health is important. They're dealing with loss, and forcing themselves to hold babies is causing them distress. The key here is whether the author acted inconsiderately or if the coworker was overstepping. The author tried to set boundaries, which is okay, but the method might have been an issue. Setting the baby down without consent could be seen as rude, even if the baby can walk. The coworker might have felt disrespected, especially if she was trying to get the author to hold the baby against their will.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They had a valid reason for not wanting to hold the baby, but the way they handled it might have been the problem. Instead of setting the baby on the floor, maybe they could have politely declined again or asked the coworker to take the baby. The coworker's actions were also not great by pushing the baby repeatedly, but the author's response might have crossed a line. It's a tough call, but the act of putting the baby on the floor might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the author's intention was to avoid distress. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering the author's mental state, maybe it's B. Hmm.\n"
