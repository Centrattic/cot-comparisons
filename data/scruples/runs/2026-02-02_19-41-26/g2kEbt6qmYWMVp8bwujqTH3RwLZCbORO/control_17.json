But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they lost a baby last year and now find it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them anymore, but their coworker keeps pushing the baby onto them. When the author finally refuses and sets the baby down, the coworker gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid emotional reason for not wanting to interact with babies\u2014grieving the loss of their own child is a serious issue. It's completely understandable that being around babies could trigger sadness and pain. People should be more empathetic in such cases.\n\nNow, the coworker's actions. She brings the baby into the office regularly and expects the author to hold it. Even after being told they don't want to hold the baby, she doesn't take it back immediately. That seems a bit inconsiderate. The coworker might not realize the emotional impact on the author. But on the other hand, she's probably just used to everyone wanting to hold babies and might not think about others' feelings.\n\nThe key moment is when the author sets the baby down. The coworker got angry about that. The baby can walk, so putting it on the floor isn't dangerous. The author didn't harm the child. But maybe the coworker felt disrespected or that the author was being rude in front of others. However, the coworker was the one who insisted on making the author hold the baby despite their discomfort.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, while it's important to respect others' wishes, the coworker's reaction might be too harsh. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially given their personal loss. The coworker should have respected that refusal without making the author feel guilty or forcing them into a situation they're uncomfortable with.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their actions, and the coworker's behavior was inconsiderate. The answer should be B.\n"
