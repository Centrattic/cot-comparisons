But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who, after losing a baby, finds it painful to be around babies. People expect them to hold babies, but the author is uncomfortable. In the specific incident, the coworker insists on having the author hold her grandchild, and when the author refuses, they set the baby down on the floor. The coworker is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing their own child. Their reaction is a legitimate emotional response. It's understandable that they don't want to force themselves into situations that trigger sadness. The author isn't refusing to hold the baby out of dislike but because of pain, which is a valid reason.\n\nThen, the coworker's actions. She insists on having the author hold the baby despite their refusal. When the author says no, she doesn't take the baby back, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The author then places the baby on the floor (not an infant, since the baby can walk). The coworker gets angry, but maybe she should have respected the author's boundary right from the start.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author's coworker didn't back down when the author said no, which led to the conflict. The author is prioritizing their mental health, which is important. However, setting the baby down might be seen as abrupt, but given the context, it might be a necessary action to avoid further discomfort and to be honest about their feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The coworker's insistence and failure to respect boundaries are problematic. The author acted in a way that's true to their emotional state. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
