But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to hold babies anymore after losing their own baby, and then a specific incident where they set a baby down on the floor instead of holding it, which upset the coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has experienced a significant personal loss\u2014losing their baby. Since then, they find it painful to be around babies because it's a reminder of their loss. People expect them to interact with babies, but it's uncomfortable for the author. The coworker keeps bringing her grandkids into the office, and in this case, a baby. When the author refuses to hold the baby, the coworker gets angry because the author sets the baby down on the floor. The coworker doesn't pick the baby up, so the author leaves the baby to walk off.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons\u2014grieving is personal, and they have a right to their feelings. They might be dealing with trauma, and forcing interactions could be harmful. They didn't want to hurt anyone but still had to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker is bringing her grandchild to work, expecting others to interact. The author's action of placing the baby on the floor might seem abrupt or inconsiderate. Even if the baby can walk, it's possible the coworker felt embarrassed or that the author was being rude. The coworker's reaction might be about the social expectation of holding babies, even if the author is struggling with it.\n\nBut the baby wasn't harmed; the author didn't drop them. They set the baby down carefully. The coworker chose not to take the baby back immediately, which might have been her choice. The author was honest about not wanting to hold the baby but ended up setting it down because the coworker didn't take it back. The author's actions were a way to avoid further discomfort, but the coworker took it personally.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect to hold babies when offered, especially in a social setting. However, the author's situation is a valid exception due to trauma. The coworker might not have considered the author's feelings, but the author's method of handling it could have been more considerate. Instead of just setting the baby down, maybe they could have communicated more clearly or suggested another way to manage the situation without causing offense.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a legitimate reason and were honest. However, the way they handled the situation could have been more thoughtful. But the coworker's reaction also seems harsh, considering the author's explanation. The key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given their circumstances. Since the author didn't force the baby into their arms and the baby was safe, maybe they aren't the asshole. But the coworker's intent to parade the baby around and expect others to hold it might also be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while both sides have points, the author's actions, though potentially inconsiderate in method, stem from a valid emotional response. The coworker's reaction might be more about social expectations than the actual harm done. Therefore, the author might not be the asshole, but there's room for both perspectives. However, the act of setting the baby down without a graceful exit might have been a misstep. But considering the context, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
