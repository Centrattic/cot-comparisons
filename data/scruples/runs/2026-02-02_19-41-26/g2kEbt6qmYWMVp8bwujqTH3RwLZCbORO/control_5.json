But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold babies after losing their own baby. They explain that it's painful for them, but people still expect them to engage. The coworker keeps bringing over a grandchild, and the author ends up setting the baby down on the floor, which the coworker is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the author's trauma. Losing a baby is a significant and traumatic event. It's reasonable that being around babies might trigger emotional pain. The author mentions they don't want to force themselves into uncomfortable situations, which is a valid boundary. They've come a long way but are still dealing with deep sadness, so their reaction isn't out of malice but grief.\n\nThen, the coworker's behavior. She parades the grandchildren around the office weekly, including a baby, and insists the author hold him. The coworker doesn't take the baby back when the author declines, leading to the author placing the baby on the floor. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back might have forced the author into a difficult situation. Setting a walking toddler down on the floor might be okay since he can walk, but the coworker's anger suggests she felt disrespected.\n\nThe key points are the author's emotional state and the coworker's expectations. The author's refusal is a boundary, but the method of setting the baby down might have been abrupt. However, the coworker's insistence on making the author hold the baby despite their discomfort is problematic. The author's action was a reaction to being pushed beyond their limits. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially given their trauma. The coworker should have respected the author's limits from the start.\n"
