But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The author lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them, which upsets others, especially a coworker who insists on making them hold the baby. The coworker gets angry when the author refuses and the author sets the baby down, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma, which is a serious issue. It's understandable that being around babies triggers their pain. They're not trying to be rude; they're trying to protect their mental health. However, their actions might have been perceived as disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker expected the author to hold the baby, which might be a common social expectation. When the author refused and then set the baby down without the coworker's permission, that could be seen as dismissive. The coworker might feel disrespected or that her child isn't being treated properly.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and communication. The author's grief is valid, but they could have communicated their feelings more clearly. Instead of setting the baby down abruptly, they might have explained their situation once more and asked the coworker not to force the interaction. The coworker, on the other hand, might need to be more sensitive to the author's trauma rather than insisting on social norms.\n\nThe author's action of setting the baby down might have been necessary for their comfort, but the method could have been handled more carefully. The coworker's reaction is also a problem because she forced the interaction and refused to take the baby back. Both parties have some responsibility here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they tried to set boundaries, but the execution led to conflict, it's a bit nuanced. The author's intent was to avoid pain, but their action might have been seen as rude. So, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for better communication.\n"
