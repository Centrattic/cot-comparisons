But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author had a miscarriage last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. They used to love babies but now avoid them. People expect them to interact, but it's causing emotional pain. The coworker keeps bringing her grandkids into the office and insists the author hold the baby. The author refuses, and the coworker gets angry when they set the baby down instead.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's feelings are valid; grief is a real emotion. They have a right to their boundaries, especially after a loss. Forcing someone to interact when it's painful isn't fair. However, setting a baby down suddenly might be seen as abrupt, but the baby was already walking and the author didn't drop or harm it. The coworker's reaction might be over the top, especially since she wouldn't take the baby back. \n\nThe key points are the author's emotional state and the coworker's insistence. The author isn't being inconsiderate of the baby's needs but of their own mental health. The coworker's actions might be more about her expectations than the baby's. The author's refusal isn't malicious but a matter of personal boundaries. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
