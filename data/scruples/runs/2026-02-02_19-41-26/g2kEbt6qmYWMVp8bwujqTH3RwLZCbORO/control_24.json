But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're an asshole for not wanting to hold babies after losing their own. They explain they lost their baby last year, which makes looking at babies painful. They mention that others expect them to interact with babies, but it's not comfortable for them. The coworker had a baby and kept shoving it into their arms, and when the author refused, they set the baby on the floor, leading to the coworker being angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing a child. It's reasonable that being around babies triggers their sadness. They're setting boundaries to protect their mental health. They didn't force interaction and tried to avoid it politely. When the coworker didn't take the baby back, they placed it on the floor, which isn't dangerous since the baby can walk. The coworker got angry, but the author's action was to remove themselves from a situation that's causing them distress.\n\nOn the other side, the coworker might not understand the author's trauma. She's used to people wanting to hold babies and might not consider the author's feelings. Her action of not taking the baby back could have been the bigger issue here. The author's refusal isn't malicious; it's about their emotional well-being. They didn't hurt the baby and tried to handle it safely.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to set boundaries after a personal loss, the coworker's lack of consideration for the author's feelings, and the fact that the baby wasn't harmed. The author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their mental health, and the coworker should have respected that. So, the answer is B.\n"
