But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold babies after experiencing a loss and then refusing to hold a coworker's grandchild, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that their past trauma makes being around babies painful. They mention that others expect them to interact with babies, which causes offense when they decline. The coworker in question forced the baby into their arms and wouldn't take it back when the author rejected the interaction, leading to the author placing the baby on the floor. The coworker got angry about this.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are the author's emotional state due to past trauma and their right to set personal boundaries versus the coworker's expectations and the child's safety. \n\nThe author didn't physically harm the baby; they set the baby down on the floor where it could walk. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back might have left the author in a difficult spot. The author's intention was to get out of holding the baby without causing harm. \n\nHowever, placing a baby on the floor, even if the child is walking, might be seen as inconsiderate or unsafe in some contexts. But given the author's explanation of trauma and the coworker's insistence, it's a boundary issue. The coworker's reaction might be more about her own expectations than the author's action's safety. \n\nConsidering workplace dynamics, the author might be justified in protecting their mental health, but the method they used could be problematic. However, the coworker's behavior of forcing the baby into the author's arms is also an issue. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's action was reasonable given their trauma and the coworker's role in the situation. The author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their boundaries, especially after explaining their reason for avoiding babies. The coworker's reaction is unreasonable given the author's valid emotional pain.\n"
