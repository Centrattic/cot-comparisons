But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to hold a baby after experiencing a loss. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author lost a baby last year and now finds being around babies painful. They don't want to hold them anymore, which makes sense because it's a personal grief. But their coworker expected them to hold the baby, even after refusing, and then the coworker got angry when the author set the baby down.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's right to set boundaries based on their grief versus the coworker's reaction. The coworker didn't respect the author's refusal and even forced the baby into their arms before. Now, the author set the baby down because they didn't want to hold him, and the coworker was upset. \n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, the author was clear about not wanting to hold the baby. If they had the right to say no, then setting the baby down might be a reasonable action. However, maybe they could have handled it differently? Like, maybe they could have suggested someone else hold the baby instead of just putting it on the floor. But the coworker was shoving the baby into their arms and wouldn't take it back. \n\nThe coworker seems to be in the wrong here by not respecting the author's boundaries. The author was trying to handle their grief and discomfort. Putting the baby on the floor might seem abrupt, but given the context, it's a way to remove themselves from the situation. However, maybe there's a better way. But the coworker's behavior was pushing the author's buttons. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't entirely at fault. They have a valid reason for their actions based on their loss. The coworker's reaction is more problematic because they didn't respect the author's wishes. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
