But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The person wrote about not wanting to hold babies since losing their own baby, and then a conflict with a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has experienced a significant personal loss, which makes them uncomfortable around babies. They mention that others don't understand and get offended when the author doesn't show interest. The specific incident was refusing to hold a baby, leading the coworker to be angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author had a valid reason for their discomfort, stemming from grief. They tried to avoid the situation but were forced into it. When they refused, the coworker was upset. The author set the baby down, but the coworker didn't pick it up either. \n\nOn one hand, the author's feelings are legitimate. Grief is a real and valid experience. It's understandable that they don't want to be around babies. But on the other hand, the coworker's perspective matters. She might not know about the author's loss and expects the same behavior as before. However, the coworker's actions\u2014forcing the baby into the author's arms and getting angry\u2014also seem problematic. \n\nThe key points: Did the author have the right to set the baby down? The author mentions the baby can walk, so setting him on the floor wasn't dangerous. But the coworker's refusal to take the baby back might be part of the issue. The author's response was to set the baby down, which might be seen as abrupt, but given the context of their grief, maybe it's a reasonable boundary. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, pushing someone to hold a baby when they're not comfortable could be considered inconsiderate. The coworker's reaction might be more about her own expectations than the situation. The author's action was a way to protect their emotional well-being. \n\nSo, considering the author's valid reasons and the coworker's inconsiderate behavior, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, the author could have communicated their discomfort better to avoid the situation. But given the circumstances, their action was a response to ongoing pressure.\n"
