But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The author had a miscarriage and now finds it painful to be around babies. Their coworker keeps bringing her grandkids to the office and insists the author hold the baby, which the author is uncomfortable with. Today, the author refused and set the baby down, leading to the coworker being angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma, so their reaction is understandable. It's their right to set boundaries, especially after a loss. Forcing someone to interact with a baby when it's triggering isn't appropriate. However, the coworker might feel disrespected or that the author is being rude in front of the child.\n\nBut the key points are the author's mental health and the coworker's insistence. The author didn't hold the baby, but instead of engaging in a confrontation, they set the baby down. The coworker didn't pick the baby up, which might have been a mistake. The author's action was to protect their own emotional well-being, which is valid. However, setting the baby down without a prior discussion might have been abrupt. Maybe the author could have explained their feelings better, but they were upfront about not wanting to hold the baby. The coworker's anger seems unwarranted given the author's valid reasons. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
