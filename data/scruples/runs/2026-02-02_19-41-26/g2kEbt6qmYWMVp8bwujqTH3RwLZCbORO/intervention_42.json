But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to hold the baby. The author had a personal loss, so their feelings are understandable. They mentioned not being able to look at babies without feeling sadness. That makes sense; grief can affect how people react to certain situations.\n\nThe coworker keeps bringing the baby to the office and expects the author to hold him. The author has tried to set boundaries before but the coworker doesn't respect them. When the author finally says no and sets the baby down, the coworker gets angry. \n\nThe key here is whether the author had a right to set that boundary. The author's action was to place the baby on the floor where he could walk away. The baby wasn't harmed, and the coworker's refusal to take the baby back led to the conflict. \n\nThe coworker's reaction seems over the top. Insisting on holding the baby despite the author's clear discomfort isn't considerate. However, the author did set the baby down without asking again, which might be seen as abrupt. But considering the emotional impact of the loss, the author's boundaries are valid. \n\nThe coworkers' expectation that everyone must engage with babies might not account for personal grief. The author didn't force anyone to hold the baby; they just didn't want to. So, the coworker is in the wrong for not respecting the boundary, and the author is not the asshole for standing by their needs after explaining the situation.\n"
