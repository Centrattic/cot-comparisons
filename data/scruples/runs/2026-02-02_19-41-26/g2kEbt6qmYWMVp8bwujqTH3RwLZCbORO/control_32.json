But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. Their coworker keeps bringing the grandkids into the office, and when the author refuses to hold the baby, they set the baby down on the floor, which upset the coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma, which is a valid and serious issue. Their feelings are real, and they shouldn't be forced to interact if it causes them distress. The coworker's actions might not be considering the author's emotional state.\n\nBut then, the coworker is also acting out of what she thinks is normal\u2014showing off her grandkids. She might not realize the author's sensitivity. However, when the author refuses to hold the baby, the coworker doesn't take it back, leaving the baby with the author. The author then sets the baby down, which the coworker is upset about.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding their comfort. The coworker, on the other hand, might have overstepped by not respecting the author's refusal and not taking the baby back. However, the author's decision to set the baby down on the floor without the parent's input could be seen as abrupt. But since the baby can walk, maybe it wasn't harmful. The coworker's reaction seems to be more about the action than the baby's safety.\n\nI think the main issue is the coworker not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's action was a response to being forced into an uncomfortable situation. While the method might not have been perfect (maybe a better way to handle it), the underlying issue is the coworker's lack of empathy. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
