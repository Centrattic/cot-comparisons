But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who no longer wants to hold babies due to losing their own baby, leading to conflict with a coworker.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is their grief. They lost a baby and now find it painful to be around infants. That's a valid emotional response. The coworker, however, is pressuring them to hold the baby and gets angry when they refuse. The key points here are consent and respect for personal boundaries.\n\nThe author didn't want to hold the baby and communicated that. The coworker didn't respect that and forced the situation. When the author set the baby down on the floor, the coworker was upset. The question is whether the author overstepped by placing the baby on the floor. However, since the baby can walk, setting him on his feet isn't the same as leaving an infant unattended. The author tried to be considerate.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common to expect people to hold babies, it's not acceptable to pressure someone against their will. The coworker's reaction seems to stem from a lack of understanding of the author's grief. The author's actions were within their right to set boundaries, especially given their emotional state. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back and the subsequent anger make her the one in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
