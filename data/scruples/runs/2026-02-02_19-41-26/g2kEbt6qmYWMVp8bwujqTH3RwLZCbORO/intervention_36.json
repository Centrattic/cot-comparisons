But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who doesn't want to hold babies anymore after losing their own baby. They set a baby down on the floor when their coworker insists on making them hold it again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to interact with babies\u2014they're struggling with grief. It's understandable that being around babies is painful for them. They tried to explain their feelings and set boundaries but ended up in a conflict when the coworker didn't respect their request.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might feel that the author was being rude by not holding the baby and then putting it down. The coworker might think that the author should make an effort, especially in a professional setting. Also, setting a baby down on the floor could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the baby can walk. The coworker's frustration comes from the author not respecting her desire to have the baby held, and she might have felt disrespected or dismissed.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and respect for boundaries. The author did communicate their discomfort, but the coworker didn't take it seriously and kept pushing. The author then took a direct action (setting the baby down) which might have been the only way to enforce their boundary, but it could come off as abrupt. However, given the situation, the author might have felt cornered. \n\nI think the author wasn't in the wrong because they had a legitimate reason and tried to explain themselves. The coworker's reaction might be more about her own expectations than the author's actions. The author's main issue was not wanting to trigger their grief, which is a personal and sensitive matter. That said, putting the baby down might not have been the best approach, but considering the circumstances, maybe it was necessary to protect their own emotional state. The coworker should have respected the initial refusal without pushing. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
