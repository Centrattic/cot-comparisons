But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The author is dealing with grief after losing a baby. They used to love babies but now find it painful, and it's hard for them to be around them. The coworker keeps bringing her grandkids into the office and expects the author to hold the baby. When the author declines, the coworker gets angry. The author sets the baby down to walk but gets criticized for it.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings are valid. Grief is personal, and it's reasonable they don't want to engage with babies. The coworker's actions might be well-intentioned, but forcing someone to hold a baby when they're uncomfortable isn't considerate. The author's refusal is their right, especially after explaining their reasons. Setting the baby down, since he can walk, might not be ideal, but the coworker's refusal to take him back was part of the problem. The coworker's anger seems excessive, not considering the author's emotional state. The key point is that the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being. So the answer should be B.\n"
