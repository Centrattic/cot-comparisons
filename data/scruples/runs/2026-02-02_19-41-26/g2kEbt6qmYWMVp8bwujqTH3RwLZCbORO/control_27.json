But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after refusing to hold a baby and setting it down instead. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The author lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. They're not faking it; it's a real emotional response. People expect them to interact with babies, but it's causing them distress.\n\nThe situation with the coworker: she brings the grandchild to the office frequently and insists the author hold the baby. The author declines, and when the coworker won't take the baby back, the author places the baby on the floor. The coworker gets angry about this.\n\nFrom an emotional standpoint, the author is dealing with grief. It's reasonable that they'd want to avoid triggers. They tried to communicate their discomfort but were forced into the situation. Setting the baby down might seem abrupt, but the baby was already walking, so it wasn't unsafe. The coworker's reaction seems harsh given the author's explanation.\n\nLegally, maybe not an issue, but socially, there's a conflict between the author's boundaries and the coworker's expectations. The author isn't physically harming anyone; they're just asserting their limits. The coworker's insistence on holding the baby despite the author's refusal could be the real problem here.\n\nSo, considering the emotional trauma and the author's attempt to set boundaries, it's more about their right to protect their mental health rather than being in the wrong. The coworker's reaction is more about her expectations not being met. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
