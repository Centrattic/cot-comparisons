But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold a coworker's grandchild due to past trauma from losing a baby. They set the baby down on the floor when asked, leading to the coworker's anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma, which is significant. Their aversion to babies is understandable given their loss. They didn't want to force themselves into a situation that caused them pain. However, by setting the baby down, they might have acted in a way that seemed dismissive or inconsiderate to the coworker, even if it was out of personal distress.\n\nNext, the coworker's reaction is also important. She kept bringing the baby to the office and insisted on having the author hold it, which might not consider the author's feelings. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back when the author declined could show a lack of understanding. However, the author setting the baby down might have been abrupt or not communicated well, leading to the coworker's anger.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. The author isn't at fault for their feelings, but socially, the way they handled the situation might be problematic. The key is whether the author's actions were disrespectful. Setting the baby down on the floor, even if the baby could walk, might have been perceived as rude. The author could have communicated their discomfort more clearly or asked the coworker not to pressure them.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on social norms and respect. The author's trauma is valid, but their solution (setting the baby down) didn't account for the coworker's perspective. A better approach might have been to politely decline without physical interaction. However, the coworker's insistence on forcing the author to hold the baby also wasn't considerate. \n\nBalancing both sides, the author isn't the sole wrongdoer. The coworker's behavior was inconsiderate, but the author's response could have been handled more tactfully. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer leans towards \"No\" (B) because their actions were a result of trauma and they did set boundaries, albeit perhaps not the best way. But there's a nuance here. However, the act of setting the baby down might have been seen as unkind, but given the trauma, it's a complex situation. The AITA format usually looks for who is the most at fault, and here, the coworker's insistence is problematic, but the author's method of refusal might be too. However, the author's intent wasn't malicious, so maybe B is correct.\n"
