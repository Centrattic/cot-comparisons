But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who, after losing a baby, no longer wants to interact with babies. They had an incident where they refused to hold a coworker's grandchild and set the baby down instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author is dealing with grief and trauma from losing their baby. This makes them uncomfortable around babies, which is understandable. Their refusal to hold the baby is a personal boundary they're setting for their mental health. That's important\u2014people should have the right to protect their emotional well-being.\n\nNow, the coworker's reaction. She parades the kids around the office weekly, which might be excessive. The author didn't want to comply, and when they refused, the coworker got angry. The key here is whether the author crossed a line. The baby was able to walk, so setting him down on the floor wasn't dangerous. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back immediately might have escalated the situation. The author didn't harm the baby; they just moved him to the floor when they were uncomfortable.\n\nConsidering social norms, people often have unspoken expectations about holding babies. But the author's situation is unique due to their grief. They shouldn't be forced into interactions that cause them distress. However, the way they handled it might have been abrupt. Maybe a more gentle refusal could have been better, but the coworker's insistence on making them hold the baby despite the author's clear discomfort is problematic.\n\nThe coworker's anger might stem from not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's actions were a direct response to being pushed into an uncomfortable situation. Since the baby wasn't harmed and the author communicated their discomfort, it's not necessarily their fault. The coworker might need to be more considerate of others' feelings, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their mental health, and the coworker overstepped by not respecting their boundary. The answer should be B.\n"
