But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after refusing to hold a baby and setting it down on the floor. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The author lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. That's a valid emotional response, especially after such a loss. People often don't understand how grief works, so the author's feelings are legitimate.\n\nThen there's the situation with the coworker. The coworker has grandchildren that come by the office, and one of them has a baby. The coworker keeps bringing the baby around and making the author hold it, even though the author has made their feelings known. The coworker even refuses to take the baby back when the author doesn't want to hold it. \n\nThe author says they told the coworker they didn't want to hold the baby, but when the coworker refused to take him back, the author set him on the floor. The coworker got angry about that. The key points here are whether the author acted inconsiderately and if their actions were unreasonable.\n\nSetting the baby down when it can walk might not be as bad as with an infant. The baby can walk, so it's not left in a dangerous situation. However, the act of putting a child on the floor without consulting the parent or caregiver might be seen as dismissive or rude, even if the child is okay. \n\nBut the coworker's behavior is also questionable. She's persistently forcing the author to interact despite knowing their feelings. The author has a right to their boundaries, especially given their trauma. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back when the author declined is part of the problem.\n\nSo, the author was in a difficult position. They communicated their discomfort, but the coworker didn't respect that. The author's action was a direct response to being put in an uncomfortable situation again. While setting the baby down might be seen as abrupt, it's important to consider the context of grief and the coworker's inconsiderate behavior.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people often push others to engage with babies, not realizing it's not always appropriate. The author's refusal isn't malicious but stems from personal pain. The coworker's anger seems misplaced, as she was the one who forced the interaction.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They were protecting their emotional well-being and the coworker should have respected their boundaries from the start.\n"
