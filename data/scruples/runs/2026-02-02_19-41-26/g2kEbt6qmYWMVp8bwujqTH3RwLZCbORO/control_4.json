But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to hold babies after experiencing a loss. The key points are the author's emotional pain and the coworker's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. That's a valid emotional response. People often don't consider how personal losses affect others. The coworker keeps bringing the baby to the office and expects the author to hold him, which is causing discomfort.\n\nThe coworker shoved the baby into the author's arms and refused to take him back. The author, after being forced, finally set the baby down. The coworker got angry. Now, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author has a right to their emotional boundaries. Forcing someone to hold a baby when they're not comfortable, especially after a trauma, isn't respectful. The coworker's insistence and not taking \"no\" for an answer seems more problematic. The author did set the baby down, but since the baby can walk, maybe the coworker could have handled it better. The coworker's anger might be misplaced here. The author isn't being inconsiderate of the baby's needs\u2014they just can't handle the emotional aspect. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
