But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to hold babies after losing their own. They mentioned that it's painful for them and they don't want to force themselves. The situation with the coworker and the baby led to conflict when they set the baby down instead of holding it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's feelings. Losing a baby is a huge trauma, and it's understandable they might find it hard to be around babies. They're not trying to be rude, but their past trauma affects their current behavior. The coworker, on the other hand, is trying to involve them in a way that's normal but maybe not considering their feelings.\n\nThe coworker shoves the baby into their arms and then gets angry when they refuse. The person sets the baby down, which might be seen as abrupt. But the baby can walk, so maybe it's not dangerous. The coworker's reaction is harsh, but the person is within their right to set boundaries.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't want to hold the baby and communicated that. The coworker didn't respect their boundary by not taking the baby back. The author tried to handle it by setting the baby down, which is a reasonable way to avoid holding. Maybe the coworker is more at fault for not respecting their wishes. But the author could have tried to explain their feelings earlier to set expectations. However, in the moment, they were just trying to protect their own emotional state. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
