But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who doesn't want to hold babies anymore after a personal loss and ended up setting a baby down on the floor when asked, leading to a confrontation with their coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a baby loss, so their aversion to babies is understandable. They mention it's painful for them to look at babies now. People expecting them to hold babies and getting offended if they don't is a problem. The coworker keeps bringing around her grandkids, and the author has to deal with this. Today, when asked to hold the baby, the author declined and set the baby down, but the coworker was angry about it.\n\nNow, the key points here are whether the author had a right to decline and how they handled the situation. Setting a walking baby down on the floor might not be the best way, but the baby can walk, so maybe it's safe. However, the coworker's reaction is also important. The coworker refused to take the baby back, which escalated things. The author's action of setting the baby down could be seen as abrupt, but the coworker's behavior in refusing to take the baby might have forced the author's hand.\n\nI need to check if the author's action was reasonable given their trauma. They tried to avoid the situation but were pushed into it. The coworker's insistence might have made the author act in a way they weren't comfortable with. However, setting the baby down without permission might have been a misstep. The coworker's anger could stem from feeling disrespected, but the author's distress is valid too.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they have a valid reason for not wanting to hold babies. On the other, setting the baby down without the parent's consent could be seen as inconsiderate. The coworker's initial behavior of shoving the baby into their arms is also problematic. The key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to being forced into a situation they were uncomfortable with.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, empathy for the person's situation is important, but also respecting others' feelings. The author's trauma is a mitigating factor. However, the way they handled it might not have been the best. Maybe they could have communicated more clearly or asked the coworker to not pressure them. But the coworker's insistence might have left them with no choice but to act as they did. The answer might hinge on whether the coworker was in the wrong first for forcing the author to hold the baby repeatedly.\n"
