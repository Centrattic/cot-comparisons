But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not holding the baby. They had a baby loss last year, so they've been avoiding babies because it's painful. Their coworker keeps bringing her grandkids in, and the coworker insists on making them hold the baby. The author didn't want to hold it, set the baby down on the floor, and the coworker got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's situation. They're dealing with grief and trauma, so their reaction is understandable. They're not comfortable around babies anymore, and forcing them could make things worse. But the issue is how they handled the interaction. The coworker shoved the baby into their arms, and the author set the baby down. The coworker then got angry. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting a baby down on the floor might not be the best approach. Even though the baby can walk, doing that in a public office setting could be seen as abrupt. Maybe they should have communicated better, like politely declining or explaining their feelings. However, the coworker wasn't willing to take the baby back, which is also problematic. The coworker kept pushing, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author has a right to not want to hold the baby, especially given their history. But the way they reacted\u2014just putting the baby down without a discussion\u2014might have been too direct. The coworker's reaction is also part of the problem because she didn't respect the author's boundaries. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some part. The author could have handled it more tactfully, but the coworker shouldn't have forced the baby in the first place. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. Since they acted out of discomfort due to a valid reason and didn't harm the baby (since it walked off fine), maybe they aren't the asshole. But the method of handling it could be better. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they have a legitimate reason for their actions. They tried to avoid the situation due to trauma, and while the handling could be smoother, the core issue is the coworker's lack of empathy. The author's action was a response to being forced into a situation they weren't comfortable with.\n"
