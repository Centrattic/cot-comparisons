But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold babies after experiencing the loss of their own baby. They explain that seeing babies triggers their grief, and they've had enough of people expecting them to interact with babies. The key incident was when a coworker kept pushing a baby towards them, and the author set the baby down on the floor, leading to the coworker being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional context. The author is dealing with a significant personal trauma\u2014losing a baby. Their reaction of pain and aversion to babies is a natural emotional response. People often don't understand how traumatic pregnancy or infant loss can be, which might lead to them not respecting the author's boundaries.\n\nNext, the action taken: the author set the baby down on the floor. The coworker refused to take the baby back, so the author put the baby down. The baby is walking, so it's not a newborn, and the author didn't leave it unattended for long. However, doing this in public might be seen as irresponsible or inconsiderate. But given the context, the author was trying to set a boundary.\n\nThe coworker's reaction: she got angry. That suggests she didn't consider the author's feelings or the reason behind the action. However, the author could have handled the situation differently, maybe by explaining their feelings more clearly instead of just setting the baby down. But considering the emotional state, the author might not have been in a place to explain further.\n\nLegally, placing a toddler on the floor isn't necessarily wrong if they can walk, but socially, it's about respect. The author's right to set boundaries is important. However, the way they did it might have been abrupt. But given the trauma, it's a complex situation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The coworker's behavior was inconsiderate by not respecting the author's wishes, and the author might have overstepped by setting the baby down without a more graceful exit. However, the root cause is valid emotional pain. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author had a legitimate reason and was asserting their boundaries, even if the method was a bit harsh. The coworker should have been more understanding. The key is balancing empathy for both parties but considering the trauma as a valid reason for the author's actions.\n"
