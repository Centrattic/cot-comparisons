But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who doesn't want to hold babies anymore after a loss, but their coworker is upset when they refuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author lost a baby last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. They explain their feelings, and the coworker gets angry when the author refuses to hold the grandchild. The coworker even shoved the baby into their arms before, but the author set the baby down this time.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author has a valid reason\u2014grieving and trauma from losing a baby. They're not forcing themselves to be uncomfortable, which is understandable. However, the coworker might feel disrespected because of the way the author handled the situation. Setting the baby down might not be safe, but the author mentions the baby can walk, so maybe it's okay. But the coworker's reaction is also part of it.\n\nThe key points here are empathy for the author's situation versus considering the coworker's expectations. The author didn't hurt the baby, but maybe the way they refused could be handled better. However, the coworker's initial behavior of pushing the baby onto others might be problematic too. The author's right to set boundaries is important. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is dealing with grief and is within their rights to set boundaries, even if the coworker is upset. The coworker should respect that, even if they don't agree. The main issue is the coworker's reaction, not the author's refusal.\n"
