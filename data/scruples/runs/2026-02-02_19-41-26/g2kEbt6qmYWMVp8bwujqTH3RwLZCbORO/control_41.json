But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to hold the baby after experiencing a loss. \n\nFirst, the author lost a baby and has since developed a strong aversion to being around babies. That's a significant emotional trauma. People often don't understand how such a loss affects someone, especially when they're surrounded by reminders like babies. The author's feelings are valid; grief can make certain situations painful.\n\nNow, the coworker's actions: she expects the author to interact with the baby, even though the author has clearly stated discomfort. The coworker's behavior of \"parading\" the grandkids around and insisting on holding the baby might be inconsiderate. She even refuses to take the baby back after the author refuses, which seems a bit harsh. The coworker's reaction being angry when the author sets the baby down might indicate she's not respecting the author's boundaries.\n\nThe author did set the baby down gently, and since the baby can walk, it wasn't unsafe. The coworker's refusal to take responsibility for the baby after the author's refusal could be part of the problem. The author's main issue is the lack of consideration from others about their trauma. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common to expect people to engage with babies, it's also important to respect personal space, especially when someone has a valid emotional reason. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're protecting their mental health. The coworker, on the other hand, isn't respecting the author's boundaries, which might make her the asshole instead. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a legitimate reason for their actions and the coworker didn't respect their limits.\n"
