But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) in this situation. The situation is about not wanting to hold babies after experiencing a loss, and a coworker getting upset when they refuse to hold a baby, leading the author to set the baby down on the floor.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author had a baby loss, which has made them avoid babies and baby-related stuff. They find it painful. People expect them to interact with babies, but they don't want to. When a coworker with grandchildren keeps bringing the kids to the office and forces the author to hold the baby, the author refuses. The coworker then gets angry when the author sets the baby down instead of holding it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main factors here are the author's emotional state, their right to set boundaries, and the appropriateness of their actions in refusing to hold the baby. The coworker's reaction is also important\u2014her refusal to take the baby back and getting angry.\n\nThe author's actions: They told the coworker they didn't want to hold the baby, which is their right. However, when the coworker didn't pick the baby up, the author set the baby down. The coworker was angry about that. The author argues that the baby can walk, so setting them down wasn't dangerous. The coworker, on the other hand, might feel that it's inconsiderate or that the author was being rude.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author has a valid reason for their discomfort. Grieving and trauma can affect how people interact with certain stimuli. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries after a loss. However, the way they handled the situation might be problematic. Setting the baby down might be seen as dismissive or rude, even if the author's intention was to avoid discomfort. The coworker's insistence on holding the baby despite the author's refusal could contribute to the tension. The coworker might not be considering the author's feelings, but the author's action of setting the baby down without the parent taking over could be seen as abrupt.\n\nThe key is whether the author acted inconsiderately. The author did communicate their refusal, which is good. But instead of setting the baby down, maybe they could have suggested that the parent hold the baby. However, since the parent refused to take it back, the author had to make a choice. Setting the baby down might not be the best approach, but it's understandable given their trauma. The coworker's anger is also a factor here\u2014maybe she didn't consider the author's mental health.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person's mental health is taken into account. The author's trauma is a significant factor. However, public actions that affect others need to be balanced. If the author's refusal caused harm or distress, that's different. In this case, the baby was safe, so the action wasn't harmful. The main conflict is between the author's need to avoid triggers and the coworker's expectations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their actions. The coworker's behavior of forcing the baby into their arms and not respecting their refusal is more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
