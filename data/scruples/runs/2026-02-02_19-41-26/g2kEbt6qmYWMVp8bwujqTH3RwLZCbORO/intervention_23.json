But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not holding the baby. The context is that the author lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. The coworker keeps bringing the grandkid to the office and insists the author hold the baby, which the author refuses. The coworker gets angry when the author sets the baby down instead of holding it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to hold the baby\u2014grieving the loss of their own child. It's understandable that seeing babies is a painful reminder. They're not forcing themselves into uncomfortable situations, which is something they've struggled with since the loss. On the other hand, the coworker expects the author to engage with the baby, which is a common social norm. However, the coworker doesn't seem to respect the author's boundaries by not taking the baby back and instead getting angry.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and empathy. The author is trying to communicate their discomfort and set a boundary by declining to hold the baby. The coworker's reaction is negative, which might indicate a lack of understanding. The author's action of setting the baby down might seem abrupt, but the baby can walk, so it's not like they were left in danger. However, the act of setting a baby down without a parent present could be concerning, but in this case, the baby was mobile.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they did explicitly state they didn't want to hold the baby, and the coworker was the one who kept bringing it up. The author isn't being rude by declining; they're asserting their needs. The coworker's response\u2014refusing to take the baby back and then getting angry\u2014suggests they didn't respect the author's wishes. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're in a tough situation, grieving, and trying to maintain their comfort level. The coworker's actions and lack of empathy are more problematic.\n"
