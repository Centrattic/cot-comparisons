But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is dealing with the aftermath of losing a baby, which is a huge emotional loss. They mention that being around babies now is painful for them, making it hard to interact with others' children. Their coworker keeps bringing the grandkids, including a baby, into the office and expects the author to hold the baby. The coworker even refuses to take the baby back when the author declines, leading the author to place the baby on the floor.\n\nFirst, the author's feelings are valid. Grief is a personal experience, and it's understandable that they'd be triggered by seeing babies. They're not avoiding interaction for no reason; it's a genuine emotional response. The coworker, on the other hand, seems to not respect the author's boundaries. By \"parading\" the kids around and forcing the author to hold the baby, the coworker isn't considering their feelings. The coworker's anger when the author sets the baby down (even though the baby is mobile) seems out of line. The author didn't harm the baby and even ensured his safety by putting him on the floor where he could walk off. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The author is clearly stating their boundaries, which is important for their mental health. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The coworker's actions were inconsiderate, and the author acted to protect their own emotional state. Answer B.\n"
