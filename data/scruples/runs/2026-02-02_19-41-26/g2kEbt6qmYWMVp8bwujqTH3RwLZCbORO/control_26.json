But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold a coworker's grandchild, especially after experiencing a personal loss. The coworker seems to have pushed the author, and the author decided to set the baby down on the floor instead of holding it.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They've gone through a significant emotional trauma (losing a baby) which has caused them to develop a strong aversion to babies. This is understandable and a valid emotional response. They explain their discomfort and the pain associated with seeing babies, which is a key factor here. Their refusal isn't out of malice but out of personal grief and emotional protection.\n\nThe coworker's actions are important to consider. She's bringing the baby into the office regularly and expecting the author to interact, which might be overstepping. The coworker's insistence on getting the author to hold the baby, even after the author has expressed discomfort, could be seen as inconsiderate. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back after the author sets him down might indicate a lack of empathy towards the author's feelings. \n\nThe author's action of setting the baby on the floor\u2014while perhaps a bit abrupt\u2014might have been done with the baby's safety in mind, as the baby can walk. However, the method of setting the baby down could be questioned. Instead of placing the baby on the floor abruptly, maybe a gentler approach could have been taken, or perhaps a conversation to explain their feelings could have been had beforehand. That said, the main issue is the coworker's insistence on making the author uncomfortable despite the author's expressed boundaries.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's right to set boundaries based on their emotional state and the coworker's responsibility to respect those boundaries. The author isn't acting out of spite but out of genuine emotional pain. The coworker, on the other hand, seems to be pressuring the author to conform to social expectations without considering their trauma. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to decline holding a baby if it makes one uncomfortable, especially for valid reasons. However, the way the author handled it might be seen as abrupt. But given the context of their grief and the coworker's persistent behavior, the author's actions are more about self-preservation than being inconsiderate. The coworker's reaction (being angry) suggests a lack of understanding rather than a justified offense. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate reason for their actions, and the coworker's behavior is more likely the issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
