But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to hold babies after a personal loss and the resulting conflict with a coworker.\n\nFirst, the author lost a baby last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. That's a valid emotional response. People can have different triggers and emotional reactions, especially after such a loss. The author explains that they used to love babies but can't anymore, which makes sense given their grief.\n\nThe coworker brings her grandkids to the office regularly and expects the author to hold the baby. The author says they don't want to because it's painful, but the coworker insists. The author then sets the baby down on the floor, which the coworker is upset about.\n\nNow, the key points are: the author's emotional state vs. the coworker's expectations. The coworker might not understand the author's trauma and expects social norms (like holding a baby) to apply. However, the author is making a health choice based on their mental health. \n\nThe coworker's reaction is problematic because she refuses to take the baby back and gets angry. The author didn't force the baby to the floor; they set him down gently since he can walk. The coworker's shaming here is an issue because she didn't consider the author's feelings and overreacted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The author's action was to protect their emotional well-being. While the coworker might feel disrespected, the author isn't obligated to perform social niceties that cause them distress. The coworker's entitlement to have the author hold the baby is the problem here. The author's refusal is a boundary they need to set for their mental health.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their mental health after a loss, and the coworker overstepped by being angry.\n"
