But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is dealing with the aftermath of losing their baby, which is a huge and traumatic event. They've lost interest in babies and find it painful to be around them now. They explain that they don't want to hold babies because it's a reminder of their loss, but people around them expect them to interact. The coworker in question is pushing them to hold her grandchild despite their refusal, and when they set the baby down, the coworker is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional trauma the author is going through. Grief can drastically change a person's reactions and boundaries. It's not uncommon for trauma survivors to avoid triggers. The author isn't acting out of malice but out of pain. They tried to set boundaries by refusing to hold the baby when asked, which they have the right to do. However, when the coworker refused to take the baby back, the author set the baby down. The coworker then got angry, which adds another layer of tension.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author's actions were a result of their trauma, and they were trying to protect their mental health. However, setting the baby down without the parent's permission might have been a misstep. The coworker might feel that the author took it too far, especially if the baby was left unattended. But the author's intent was not to harm but to escape a painful situation. The coworker's refusal to respect the author's boundary by not taking the baby back first is also problematic. It's a mutual issue where both parties didn't fully consider each other's needs. The author's action, while perhaps not the best approach, was driven by genuine emotional pain. The coworker's response was dismissive of the author's feelings. So, in terms of who's in the wrong, the author isn't malicious, but their method of handling it could be improved. The coworker also didn't respect the boundary. But the question is specifically about the author's fault. Considering the context of grief, the author isn't in the wrong; they acted based on their trauma. The coworker's anger is misplaced here. So, answer B for No.\n"
