But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in the situation described. Let's start by looking at the details.\n\nThe author lost a baby last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them or talk about them, which causes discomfort for others, especially a coworker who keeps bringing her grandkids to the office. The coworker shoves a baby into the author's arms, and when the author refuses today, they set the baby on the floor. The coworker got angry about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's emotional state. They have a valid reason for their feelings\u2014grieving the loss of their child. It's understandable that being around babies is triggering. People often don't realize how sensitive others can be after such a loss. The author is asserting their boundaries by refusing to hold the baby, which is their right. They didn't force the situation; the coworker insisted.\n\nHowever, setting the baby down on the floor might be seen as abrupt. But the author mentions the baby can walk, so it wasn't an infant. They placed the baby on the floor, allowing him to move off. The coworker's reaction was anger, which seems harsh. The coworker should have respected the author's wishes from the start instead of pressing the issue. The author's action was a last resort after repeated discomfort. They didn't act out of malice but to protect their emotional health.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's polite to engage with others' children, it's also important to respect personal boundaries, especially given the author's trauma. The coworker's insistence on holding the baby despite the author's refusal is problematic. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're managing their grief. The key here is whether the author acted out of spite or necessity. Since the author tried to avoid the situation before and only set the baby down when pushed, they aren't the asshole. The coworker's behavior is more in the wrong for not respecting boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
