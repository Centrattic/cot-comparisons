But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold babies after losing their own baby, and a conflict with a coworker who didn't take well to the author declining to hold her grandchild.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author explains that their trauma from losing a baby has made it painful for them to be around babies. They don't want to force themselves to interact, especially in the workplace. When a coworker insists on making them hold the baby, the author sets the baby down on the floor, leading to the coworker being angry.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? Let me break this down. The author's actions are a result of personal trauma and emotional distress. They're trying to respect their own feelings and boundaries. However, the coworker's perspective is that the author rejected her child without offering an alternative, which could be seen as dismissive or unkind.\n\nBut the key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to hold the baby. They did communicate their refusal, which is important. The coworker, however, continued to be insistent, which could be seen as pressuring the author. The author then set the baby down, which the coworker took offense to. \n\nIs setting the baby down on the floor acceptable? The baby is old enough to walk, so it's not like they were dropped or left unattended. The author did place them on the floor where they could move around. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back might have escalated the situation. \n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, people should respect others' boundaries. The coworker might not have considered the author's trauma. However, the author could have offered a compromise, like asking someone else to hold the baby instead of placing it on the floor. But considering the immediate situation, the author might not have had time for that. \n\nThe question is whether the action of setting the baby down was wrong. Given the context of the author's personal grief, it seems they acted within their right to protect their mental health. The coworker's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected rather than the baby being harmed. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as they were acting under valid emotional reasons and tried to communicate their boundary. The coworker's insensitivity and refusal to back off might have contributed to the conflict.\n"
