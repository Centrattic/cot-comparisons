But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is dealing with the aftermath of losing a baby, which is obviously a really traumatic experience. They used to love babies but now find it painful to be around them. That makes sense emotionally; when you've experienced a loss, seeing similar things can trigger sadness or grief.\n\nNow, the situation is with a coworker who keeps bringing her grandkids to the office. The coworker expects the author to interact with the baby, but the author isn't comfortable with that. The key incident was when the coworker tried to get the author to hold the baby, and when the author refused, the coworker wouldn't take the baby back. So the author set the baby on the floor, and the coworker got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the actions of both parties. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to hold the baby\u2014it's related to personal trauma. They tried to communicate their discomfort and then took action when the coworker didn't respect their wishes. But setting the baby down on the floor... is that reasonable? The baby can walk, so maybe it's not unsafe. But in a professional setting, especially with coworkers, how does that come off?\n\nThe coworker's reaction might be based on the idea that the author didn't handle the baby properly. Even if the baby is old enough to walk, putting them on the floor without a safe place might be seen as irresponsible. But the coworker also continued to hold the baby after being refused, which isn't respectful of the author's boundaries.\n\nThe author tried to say no, but when the coworker didn't comply, they had to take action. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like politely asking the coworker not to force the baby on them, or moving to a different area. But in the moment, putting the baby down might have been the only option. However, the coworker's anger might stem from the act of putting the baby on the floor, not the refusal itself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they have a right to their feelings and boundaries. On the other hand, perhaps the way they handled the situation wasn't the best. Maybe there's a middle ground. But given the trauma involved, it's understandable they're not in the right frame of mind. The coworker's behavior of not respecting the refusal and then getting angry complicates things.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely at fault. They communicated their discomfort, and the coworker didn't respect that. However, the act of putting the baby on the floor might be seen as abrupt, even if the baby is safe. The coworker's reaction might be over the top, but the author could have handled it differently. However, considering the emotional context, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because actions have consequences. Hmm.\n"
