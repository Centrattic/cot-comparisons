But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to hold a baby after experiencing a personal loss. \n\nFirst, the author's background: they lost a baby last year and now find it painful to be around babies. That's a significant emotional situation. Their reaction is understandable\u2014they're dealing with grief and trauma. They've tried to avoid interactions, but their coworker keeps forcing them to hold the baby, which is causing distress.\n\nThe specific incident: The coworker brings the baby to the office, and the author refuses to hold him. The coworker gets angry when the author sets the baby down. The author explains that the baby can walk, so setting him on the floor wasn't unsafe. The coworker is upset about this.\n\nNow, considering the author's mental health and trauma, it's reasonable for them to set boundaries. However, their method of handling it might be the issue. Instead of setting the baby down, maybe they could have communicated more clearly with the coworker earlier, or found another way to avoid the situation without putting the baby down in front of her. \n\nThe coworker's perspective is important too. She might feel disrespected or hurt if others refuse to interact with her grandchild. But she's also being inconsiderate by not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's action of setting the baby down might have been the immediate reaction, but it's possible there's a better way to handle such a sensitive situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They have a valid reason for their feelings, but their actions could have been handled more diplomatically. However, considering the emotional state and past trauma, it's not entirely their fault. The coworker also shares some responsibility for not respecting the author's wishes earlier. \n\nIn terms of answer A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No), the situation is nuanced. The author's intentions are valid, but their action might have been a poor choice. However, given the context of grief, it's debatable. Since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but after analysis, there's a balance of responsibility. The correct answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's actions stem from genuine emotional pain and they tried to avoid the situation, but the coworker's behavior was also problematic. However, in some social contexts, refusing to hold a baby might still be seen as rude regardless of the reason. But considering the circumstances, B seems more appropriate.\n"
