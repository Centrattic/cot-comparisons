But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they lost a baby last year and now can't handle being around babies. Their coworker keeps bringing her grandkids, especially a baby, to the office, and the coworker expects the author to hold the baby. The author finally says no, and when the coworker doesn't take the baby back, they set the baby on the floor. The coworker gets angry, and the author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is dealing with a lot of grief and has valid reasons for not wanting to hold babies. Their trauma is real, and forcing themselves to interact might not be healthy. They tried to avoid holding the baby before, but this time they set the baby down. The coworker is offended because she expected the author to hold the baby, and she didn't take the baby back when the author refused. \n\nNow, the key points here: The author didn't hold the baby, but set it down on the floor. The baby can walk, so maybe it's not a small infant. However, the coworker was holding the baby and then handed it to the author. When the author said no, the coworker didn't take it back. The author set the baby down, perhaps as a way to remove the situation, but the coworker took it as rude.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, setting the baby down might not be the best approach. Maybe they could have communicated their discomfort more clearly earlier. But the coworker was insistent, and the author was in a difficult emotional state. However, physically placing the baby on the floor might come across as dismissive or harsh. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like politely explaining their feelings again or asking the coworker to take the baby. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might not have been respecting the author's boundaries. If the author had consistently said no before, maybe the coworker should have respected that. But in this case, the author set the baby down without the parent taking it back. So the coworker felt disrespected, which could be valid if she expected to pass the baby. But the author's actions might be a result of their trauma. \n\nI think the coworker is also at fault for not respecting the author's boundaries if they had previously said no. However, the author's method of handling the refusal might have been too abrupt. Maybe they should have found another solution instead of setting the baby on the floor. But considering the emotional state, maybe it's understandable. However, the act of placing the baby on the floor without the parent's consent could be seen as rude. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. They didn't handle the situation gracefully, but their feelings are valid. However, the coworker also didn't respect the author's prior refusals. The answer might be that both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's action was the last straw, maybe they crossed a line. But if the coworker kept pushing, maybe the author's reaction is justified. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle it respectfully, but some might say B. Hmm.\n"
