But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong when they didn't want to hold the baby and ended up setting it down on the floor. \n\nFirst, the author had a personal loss, losing their baby last year. Since then, they've been struggling with the pain of seeing babies, which makes sense emotionally. They mention that others expect them to engage with babies, but it's painful for them. They've tried to avoid it but sometimes feel forced, like with the coworker who keeps bringing the grandchild to the office.\n\nIn the latest incident, the coworker brought a baby (who can walk) and insisted the author hold it. The author said no, but the coworker wouldn't take the baby back, so the author put the baby on the floor. The coworker got angry and said the author was out of line.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the author's emotional state and the coworker's actions. The author is dealing with grief and trauma from losing a child, which is a valid reason to feel uncomfortable around babies. They didn't want to hold the baby, which is their right. However, when the coworker refused to take the baby back, the author set the baby down. The coworker was upset because they thought the author was being rude or careless.\n\nBut the baby can walk, so setting them down isn't the same as dropping an infant. The author didn't leave the baby unattended; the baby just walked off. The coworker's reaction might be more about feeling disrespected than the baby being in danger. The author's main issue is their own grief and the pressure from others to engage with babies they find painful.\n\nIs there a better way the author could have handled it? Maybe they could have explained their feelings to the coworker, but the coworker didn't seem to respect the author's boundaries. The coworker kept bringing the baby despite the author's discomfort. The author's action was a response to being forced into a situation they didn't want to be in. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action of putting the baby down (since the baby can walk) isn't harmful, but the coworker felt wronged. However, the author has valid reasons for their feelings. So, the coworker might be at fault for pushing the author beyond their comfort zone. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being in this case. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
