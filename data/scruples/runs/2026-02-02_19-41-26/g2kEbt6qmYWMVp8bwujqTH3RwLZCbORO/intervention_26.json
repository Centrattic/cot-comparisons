But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who, after losing a baby, no longer wants to hold babies. Their coworker keeps bringing her grandkids into the office and expects them to hold the baby, but the author refuses and ends up placing the baby on the floor, which angers the coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They experienced a loss and now find it painful to be around babies. They feel that others push them to interact, which is uncomfortable. They tried to avoid holding the baby and set it down, which was seen as rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might feel that refusing to hold a baby is inconsiderate, especially in a professional setting. The coworker might have expected some tact or a different way of handling the situation, like politely declining or talking to the coworker privately. The act of putting the baby on the floor could be seen as abrupt or careless, even if the baby can walk. The coworker's hurt feelings are valid because they might have felt disrespected or thought the author was being rude in front of others.\n\nBut the author has valid reasons too. They're dealing with grief and have boundaries. However, the way they handled the refusal might not have been the best approach. Instead of setting the baby down publicly, maybe they should have communicated earlier or privately, explaining their situation. The coworker might not know about the author's past loss, so the author might need to set boundaries more diplomatically.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for having feelings and boundaries, but their method of handling the situation might have been inconsiderate. They could have been more mindful of the coworker's feelings and found a solution that respects both parties. The coworker's frustration is understandable, but maybe she should have considered the author's feelings if she knew about the loss. \n\nSo, the author might be at least partially in the wrong for not handling the refusal more gracefully, even if their reasons are valid. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but I'm a bit conflicted. However, given that the author chose to act in a way that caused the coworker to be angry without prior communication, I think the answer is A.\n"
