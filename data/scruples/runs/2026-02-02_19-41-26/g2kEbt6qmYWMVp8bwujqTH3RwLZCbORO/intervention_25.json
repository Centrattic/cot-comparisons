But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after setting a baby down instead of holding it. The author had a personal loss and finds being around babies painful. They refused to hold the baby and placed it on the floor, which led to their coworker getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's mental health and past trauma are important here. They were dealing with the loss of their baby, which explains their aversion. They didn't want to force themselves to be uncomfortable, which is a valid reason. However, the action of putting the baby on the floor might be seen as abrupt or inconsiderate, even if the baby could walk.\n\nThe coworker's reaction is also a factor. She kept parading the grandkids around and insisted the author hold the baby despite their discomfort. The author finally said no, but the coworker refused to take the baby back. The author's response was to set the baby down, which might have been seen as dismissive or rude, even if the baby was safe.\n\nBut the key here is the intent. The author didn't want to hurt anyone, just needed space. The coworker, on the other hand, might not have considered the author's feelings. However, the act of placing the baby on the floor could be perceived as a direct refusal, which might have been hurtful. The author could have handled it differently, perhaps by politely declining again or asking the coworker to take the baby.\n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for their feelings, the way they handled the situation might have been inconsiderate. They could have communicated better without putting the baby down. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but there's nuance. However, given the options, the answer might be A because the action was seen as rude despite the reasons.\n"
