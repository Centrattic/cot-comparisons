But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone who doesn't want to hold babies anymore after losing their own baby. They\u2019re at work and a coworker keeps bringing over a grandchild, expecting them to hold the baby. The author refused and set the kid down, leading to the coworker getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing their baby. It's a valid reason to not want to interact with babies, as it's a painful reminder. They\u2019re not pretending or being rude without cause. They\u2019ve explained their feelings in the AITA post, so they're being honest about their situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might feel that the author is being dismissive or rude. Parents and grandparents often feel that others should want to interact with their kids, especially babies. The coworker might not be aware of the author's history, so her reaction could be from a place of misunderstanding. However, the coworker also shoved the baby into the author's arms and didn't take him back when the author refused. That seems inconsiderate. The author was in their right to set boundaries, especially when they explained their pain. Setting a toddler down on the floor, who can walk, isn't harmful, but maybe the coworker felt it was abrupt.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. The author isn't in the wrong for refusing to hold the baby, especially given their emotional state. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back when asked is also problematic. The author tried to handle it politely but had to set a boundary. The coworker's anger stems from not understanding the author's trauma. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's valid emotional reason, the coworker's lack of awareness, and the boundary setting. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own mental health. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
