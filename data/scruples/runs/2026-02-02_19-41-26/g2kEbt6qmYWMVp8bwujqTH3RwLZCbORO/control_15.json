But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who doesn't want to hold babies because they had a loss and it's painful for them. But when a coworker insists and the author sets the baby down, the coworker gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have a valid emotional reason\u2014grief over losing a baby. That's a heavy thing. They're not avoiding the baby out of meanness, but because it's painful. They tried to set boundaries, which is important for mental health. Setting the baby down is a bit iffy, but the baby can walk, so maybe it's safe. The coworker shoved the baby into their arms again, which isn't respectful either. The coworker's reaction is also problematic because she didn't take the baby back and got angry.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently. Instead of setting the baby down, they could have asked the coworker again to take the baby. But given the context of grief, forcing interaction isn't healthy. The coworker's behavior of parading the babies around and not respecting the author's refusal is part of the problem here.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was wrong. The coworker's actions are definitely part of the issue. But the author did set a boundary and tried to handle it as best as they could. They didn't intentionally harm the baby, and the baby was okay. The main conflict is between the author's grief and the coworker's insensitivity. Since the author had a legitimate reason and acted in a way that's safe for the baby, they're probably not the asshole. So, the answer is B.\n"
