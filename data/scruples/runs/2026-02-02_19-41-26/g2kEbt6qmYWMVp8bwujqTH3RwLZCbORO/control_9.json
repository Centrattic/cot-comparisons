But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold babies after experiencing a miscarriage. They explain their discomfort and the pain it causes them, but their coworker insists on making them hold the baby, leading to a conflict when the author sets the baby down.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author has a valid reason for their feelings\u2014grieving a loss can make certain triggers painful. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries, especially if certain interactions are emotionally distressing. The coworker, on the other hand, might not understand the author's trauma and expects a different reaction, which could lead to frustration when their expectations aren't met.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to their emotional boundaries and the coworker's reaction. The author didn't force the situation; they communicated their discomfort. When the coworker didn't respect that by continuing to push, the author took an action to end the uncomfortable situation. Setting the baby down on the floor, while perhaps seen as abrupt, was done in a way that the baby could walk away safely. The coworker's anger stems from not being understood or respected in this context.\n\nIt's important to consider cultural norms around holding babies, which often involve social expectations, but personal trauma can override those norms. The author isn't being inconsiderate of the baby's needs but rather their own mental health. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back might have been the catalyst for the author's action, which is a reaction to being forced into a situation they aren't comfortable with.\n\nIn evaluating this, the author's actions are a response to their own grief and the coworker's lack of respect for their boundaries. The coworker's behavior of \"parading\" the grandchildren around and not respecting the author's wishes contributes to the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own well-being.\n"
