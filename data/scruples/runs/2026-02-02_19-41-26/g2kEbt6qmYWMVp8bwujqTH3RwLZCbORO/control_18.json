But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author lost a baby last year and now finds it painful to be around babies. People keep expecting them to interact, but they don't want to. The coworker shoves a baby into their arms, and when the author refuses to hold it, they set the baby down on the floor. The coworker got angry about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing a baby. It's understandable that being around babies triggers painful memories. They shouldn't be forced to engage in situations that cause them emotional distress. However, in the workplace, there might be social expectations to participate in such interactions, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't force themselves before. The coworker \"shove[d] the baby into my arms\" and refused to take him back. The author then set the baby down, not in a dangerous way since the baby could walk. The coworker's reaction seems excessive. The key here is whether the author acted inconsiderately or if they were within their rights to set boundaries.\n\nSetting the baby down on the floor when they can walk doesn't sound harmful. The author didn't drop the baby or act aggressively. The coworker's anger might stem from not respecting the author's boundaries and the situation being uncomfortable for everyone. The author's main issue is being forced into an interaction they're not comfortable with, which is a valid personal boundary, especially given their trauma.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their emotional well-being. The coworker should have respected their refusal. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
