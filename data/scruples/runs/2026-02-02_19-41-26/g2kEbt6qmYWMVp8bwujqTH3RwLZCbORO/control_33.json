But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to hold a baby after their own loss. They used to love babies but can't anymore because it's too painful. They tried to avoid it, but a coworker kept pushing, even shoving the baby into their arms. Today, they finally said no, put the baby down, and the coworker got angry. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing a baby. That's a heavy emotional burden. Their reaction is understandable because seeing babies reminds them of their loss. They're not trying to be rude; they're trying to protect their mental health. The coworker, on the other hand, might not realize the emotional weight here. She might think it's normal to hold babies and not understand why someone would refuse. But she also kept forcing the situation, not respecting their boundaries.\n\nNow, when the author set the baby down, the coworker got angry. But the baby could walk, so putting him on the floor might not be dangerous. The coworker's reaction seems harsh, maybe because she didn't consider the author's feelings. The author was in their right to set a boundary, even if it upset the coworker. The coworker should have respected the \"no\" from the start instead of insisting. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually expect to hold babies if offered, but the author has a valid reason to decline. The coworker's behavior of \"parading\" the kids around and not taking the baby back is inconsiderate. The author isn't the asshole here; they're trying to manage their grief and boundaries. The coworker's reaction is the real issue. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
