But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to hold babies after a loss, and then a coworker gets angry when they refuse.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had a baby loss, which is a significant trauma. Their reaction to babies being painful makes sense because of that. People expecting them to engage with babies might not realize the emotional toll. The coworker's behavior of forcing the baby into their arms without considering their feelings could be part of the problem here.\n\nThe coworker parades the grandkids around and insists on holding them, which the author finds uncomfortable. When the author refuses, the coworker doesn't take the baby back and then gets angry when the author sets the baby down. The baby can walk, so putting them on the floor isn't as risky as with an infant. But the coworker's reaction is a key point. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is trying to protect their mental health, which is important. They didn't want to hold the baby and communicated that. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back and then getting angry might be more about her own expectations than the author's actions. The author's action of setting the baby down might be necessary for their well-being. But did they handle it respectfully? They did tell the coworker ahead of time they didn't want to hold the baby. The coworker then forced the situation. \n\nLegally, unless there's a policy against it, there's no issue. Socially, the coworker might have expected more compliance, but the author's boundaries are valid. The coworker's anger seems misplaced here. The author isn't the asshole because they're prioritizing their mental health after trauma. The coworker didn't respect their wishes, leading to conflict. So the answer is B.\n"
