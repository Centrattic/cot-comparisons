But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold babies after losing their own baby. They set a baby down on the floor when a coworker kept insisting they hold it. The coworker got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's feelings. They experienced a loss, which is a significant trauma. That makes sense why being around babies is painful. They're not forcing themselves to be uncomfortable, which is a valid boundary. People often don't realize how personal losses affect others. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might have felt disrespected when the author refused to hold her grandchild. But the coworker also kept pushing, not taking the hint, and even shoved the baby into the author's arms. Then, when the author set the baby down, the coworker got angry. The coworker's actions seem over the top. The baby was already walking, so putting them on the floor wasn't dangerous. The coworker didn't have to pick them up immediately.\n\nThe key points are the author's right to their boundaries post-trauma and the coworker's overreaction. The author didn't harm the baby; they just set them down. The coworker's insistence might be more about her own expectations rather than considering the author's feelings. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a justified reason for their actions. The coworker should have respected their boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
