But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author lost a baby and now finds it painful to be around babies. They don't want to hold them, but people expect them to. The coworker keeps bringing the baby to the office and shoving it into the author's arms. Today, the author refused, set the baby down, and the coworker got angry.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're dealing with grief and trauma from losing their baby. That's a heavy burden. It's understandable they would find it painful to interact with other babies. They're trying to set boundaries to protect their mental health. But the coworker didn't respect that boundary and got angry when the author refused. The coworker even forced the baby into their arms every time. The author then set the baby down when asked again, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, the coworker's actions: repeatedly bringing the baby to the office and forcing the author to hold it might be part of the problem. The coworker might not realize how it affects the author. However, when the author finally says no and sets the baby down, the coworker is angry. The coworker could have been more considerate. On the other hand, the author chose to set the baby down, even though the coworker didn't pick it up. The baby could walk, so maybe the author didn't drop it, but the coworker still took it as an insult.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They have a valid reason due to their grief. Setting boundaries is important, especially when someone is in recovery. But the way they handled it might have been abrupt. Maybe they could have communicated better, like explaining their feelings to the coworker. However, since the coworker was already forcing the baby into their arms every time, the author might have felt they had no choice but to take a stand. The coworker's reaction was also inappropriate. Both parties might have some responsibility here, but the author's actions were a response to the coworker's lack of respect for their boundaries. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer depends on whether setting the baby down was acceptable given the coworker's prior behavior. If the coworker refused to take the baby back, the author had to act, but perhaps a gentler approach could have been better. However, considering the trauma, it's a tricky situation. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their mental health and the coworker's actions were inconsiderate. So, answer B.\n"
