But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who after experiencing a miscarriage, no longer wants to hold babies, which causes tension with a coworker who keeps trying to get her to hold a grandchild. The coworker got angry when the author refused and the author set the baby down on the floor, which the coworker took offense to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the author's trauma. Losing a baby is a significant emotional event, and it's understandable that the author might have triggers or emotional pain when around babies. The author is clear that it's painful for them to see babies, so their refusal isn't just about being lazy or rude\u2014it's a genuine emotional response. That's important because it shows the author isn't being inconsiderate without reason.\n\nNext, the coworker's behavior. The coworker \"parades\" the grandkids around and insists the author hold the baby, even when the author refuses. The coworker then refuses to take the baby back after the author sets him down. This seems a bit problematic. The coworker might not be respecting the author's boundaries. Insisting on holding a baby when someone is uncomfortable, especially after they've expressed not wanting to, could be crossing a line. The coworker's anger in response to the author setting the baby down suggests she might not be empathetic to the author's feelings.\n\nNow, the action in question: the author sets the baby down on the floor. The baby is already walking, so setting them on their feet isn't dangerous. The author isn't abandoning the baby; they just let the child go off on their own. However, the coworker took offense. Was the act of setting the baby down an appropriate response? Maybe not. While the author has a valid reason, the way they handled the refusal could be seen as abrupt. Maybe a better approach would be to calmly but firmly state their discomfort again and suggest the parent take the baby, rather than setting the baby down in front of the coworker. That might have avoided the confrontation.\n\nBut considering the trauma, the author might not be in a place to handle more than a few minutes of baby interaction. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back when asked adds pressure. The author might feel cornered. However, the coworker is in the wrong for not respecting the author's initial refusal. If the author clearly said no and the coworker still forced the situation, the author is justified in their actions to some extent. Still, setting the baby down might not be the best way to handle it. Maybe the author could have asked the coworker to take the baby, and if she refused, left the room or called HR.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They have a valid reason for their actions due to their trauma. However, the way they handled the situation might not have been the most respectful. But given the context, it's a sensitive situation. The coworker's behavior was more about not respecting boundaries, while the author's action was a reaction to that. The key here is whether the author's action was reasonable given their trauma. Since the baby was walking, setting them down isn't harmful. The coworker is more at fault for not respecting the author's wishes. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a cultural norm or something else. In some workplaces, setting a baby down without the parent's consent might be seen as rude, even if the parent is a coworker. But considering the author's history, it's a complex case. The author's well-being is important, and the coworker's insistence is inconsiderate. So, the author might be justified. Answer B.\n"
