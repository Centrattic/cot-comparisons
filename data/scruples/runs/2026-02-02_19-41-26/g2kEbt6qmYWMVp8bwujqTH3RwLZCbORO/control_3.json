But, since I lost my baby last year I just don't have any interest in them any more. Which I know sounds horrible, but its painful for me to look at them. I don't even like looking at baby related stuff for gifts anymore. Its all just one big reminder of what I lost and can't have. \n\nPeople always expect me to want to talk at their babies or hold them. And they get offended when I don't show interest. I don't want to force myself to go out of my comfort zone. I've come a long way since my loss, but it still leaves me with deep sadness whenever I'm around one.\n\nOne of my coworkers has several grandchildren who constantly stop by the office with her kids. One of them has a baby. This coworker will parade the grandkids around(even though we see them once a week at least) and shove the baby into my arms. I will then be stuck with the baby for several minutes while she coos over her grandkid and refuses to pick him back up.\n\nWell today I just wasn't in the mood to deal with it. I told her I didn't want to hold him. She refused to take him back, so I set him on the floor. He can walk now so its not like I just put an infant down on the ground. I set him down on his feet and he waddled off perfectly fine. My coworker was really angry about it and told me I was out of line for setting the kid down (again she wouldn't pick him back up). \n\nAm I the asshole here? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to hold babies since experiencing a loss, and a coworker getting upset when the author refuses to hold the baby and ends up setting it down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional aspect. The author has a valid reason for their discomfort\u2014grieving a loss. It's natural for trauma to affect how someone interacts with certain triggers, like babies. The author isn't refusing to hold the baby out of malice but due to personal pain. That's a key point.\n\nNext, the coworker's behavior. She parades the grandchildren around and insists on making the author hold the baby, even when the author is uncomfortable. The coworker then refuses to take the baby back when the author declines, leading to the author setting the baby down. The coworker's reaction is anger, which seems excessive. However, the author did set the baby down on the floor, which might be seen as dismissive or careless, even if the baby could walk. \n\nBut wait, the baby is already walking, so setting them down isn't dangerous. The coworker's refusal to take the baby back might be part of the problem here. The author's action was a way to end the uncomfortable situation without forcing themselves to hold the baby. The coworker's reaction is more about her own expectations rather than the baby's safety. \n\nSocial norms usually allow for people to decline holding infants if they're not comfortable, but doing so in a considerate way. The author tried to communicate their discomfort, so they aren't at fault for that. However, the coworker's insistence and the author's response might have been poorly handled. But given the context of grief, the author's actions are more about protecting their mental health. \n\nI think the key here is that the coworker was inconsiderate by pushing the author to hold the baby despite their obvious discomfort. The author did try to refuse politely, and the coworker escalated the situation. The author's action of setting the baby down was a last resort, but since the baby could walk, it wasn't a safety issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
