We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they mention that the kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. They also get life skills and have special occasions where they can have junk food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They believe junk food is unhealthy, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. They do allow exceptions for friends' houses and special events, which is common. The kids are engaged in extracurriculars, which might balance screen time. The parent feels \"harsh\" but also sees benefits in their approach.\n\nOn the other side, friends and family say they're too strict. But the kids are doing well academically and socially. The parent is trying to protect their kids from what they see as harmful influences. However, completely banning things like TV or video games might limit the kids' exposure to media literacy or social aspects where peers might engage in those activities. \n\nI should also think about child development. Some screen time is normal, and moderate video game play can have educational benefits or improve hand-eye coordination. However, the parent's stance is that they see no educational value. The key here is balance. The parent isn't allowing any screen time except for one movie a week. That's extremely restrictive. While they have other activities, the kids might miss out on leisure that peers engage in, which could affect their social interactions if they're not allowed to play the same games as friends.\n\nThe parent's concern about addiction and negative effects is valid, but so is the need for children to develop self-regulation skills. By not allowing any screen time or junk food at home, they might not be teaching their kids how to make healthy choices in moderation. Instead, they're enforcing strict rules without any flexibility. The fact that the kids sometimes beg for these items suggests they might not be getting their needs met, but the parent insists it's for their own good.\n\nThe children's well-being: they are happy, which is a positive sign. But happiness isn't the only factor. Are they being deprived of age-appropriate experiences? The parent is prioritizing their own values over the kids' preferences, which could lead to resentment as the kids grow older. The parent might be overprotective, thinking they're doing what's best, but it's possible they're not considering the kids' autonomy.\n\nIn terms of the author being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. Some might see the parent as protective and providing a healthy environment, while others might argue that complete bans are too restrictive. However, the parent is allowing exceptions for friends and special occasions, which shows they're not entirely rigid. The children are thriving in other areas, which supports the parent's approach. But the strictness might be unnecessary and could hinder the kids' ability to navigate social situations involving these activities.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the restrictions are reasonable. The parent's approach is extreme in some areas (no video games at all) and might not account for the kids' developmental needs for some autonomy. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for being too strict without allowing any flexibility. So, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
