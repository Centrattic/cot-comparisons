We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that they allow junk food only at friends' houses or on special occasions. They don't have it at home, and the kids usually accept that. For TV and video games, they allow occasional movies on weekends and no games because they see them as non-educational. The kids are described as happy, involved in activities, and top of their class.\n\nThe parent feels they might be too strict but believes the restrictions prevent addictions and mental harm. Others have called them too strict, but the kids have life skills. So, is the parent wrong?\n\nI should think about child development and balance. While the parent's intentions are good\u2014encouraging healthy habits and life skills\u2014completely banning things like TV and games might be extreme. Some screen time can be beneficial, especially educational content. Also, video games can have social and problem-solving benefits. However, moderation is key.\n\nThe fact that the kids are happy and successful suggests the approach is working for them. But the parent's reasoning about addiction and mind-poisoning might be overblown. It's possible they're depriving the kids of normal childhood experiences. However, the parent's control isn't harmful as long as the kids are safe and happy.\n\nOther perspectives: Some might say the parent is being protective, others that they're controlling. Since the kids are thriving and the restrictions aren't leading to unhappiness, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But there's a risk of being too restrictive. The answer might hinge on whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are okay and the parent has good intentions, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I should check if any red flags exist. No abuse, kids are happy, so probably B.\n"
