We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for their parenting choices. The situation is about not allowing junk food, TV, and video games for their kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents mention they don't have junk food at home, only allowing it on special occasions. They allow one movie a week and no video games because they find them uneducational. The kids are active in extracurriculars, top of their class, well-behaved, and learn life skills. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the parents think it's for the kids' good.\n\nNow, thinking about the potential arguments. From a parenting perspective, setting boundaries is common. Junk food restrictions can promote healthy eating, and limiting screen time might encourage more active learning or social interaction. The kids seem happy and successful, which suggests the approach is working for them. However, completely banning things like video games and TV (except one movie a week) might be seen as overly restrictive. Some might argue that moderate screen time can be beneficial, especially educational games or TV shows. Also, the lack of flexibility could lead to conflict as the kids grow older and seek independence.\n\nThe parents believe they're protecting the kids from addictions and mindless content. They mention the kids are happy, which is a positive sign. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some cultures, strict parenting is more accepted, while others prioritize balanced approaches. Since the kids are thriving academically and socially, maybe the parents are not in the wrong. However, completely denying access to modern forms of entertainment could have downsides, like social issues if peers have different rules.\n\nBut the parents do allow some exceptions and the kids are content. The fact that they engage in various activities might offset the restrictions. Also, the parents are aware of the criticism but stand by their decisions. Since the children are well-adjusted and successful, it's possible the approach is valid. However, there's a risk of the kids feeling deprived or feeling left out when peers have more freedom. The answer might hinge on whether the restrictions are considered reasonable. Since the parents have their reasons and the kids are doing well, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But if the restrictions are seen as extreme without justification, then A. Given the context, the parents are making choices based on their beliefs, and the kids aren't harmed, so B makes sense.\n"
