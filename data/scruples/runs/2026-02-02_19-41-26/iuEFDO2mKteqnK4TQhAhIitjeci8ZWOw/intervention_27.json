We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe parents don't allow junk food at home, only on special occasions. They restrict TV to one movie a week and no video games because they think it's not educational. The kids are active in extracurriculars, top of their class, and well-behaved. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the parents believe they're teaching life skills.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, consider the parents' reasoning. They mention health and education concerns, which are common. They allow some flexibility when at friends' houses or on holidays. The kids are happy and successful. They do other activities that are enriching. \n\nBut some might argue that completely banning video games and limiting TV strictly could be too restrictive. Video games can have educational aspects, like problem-solving or strategy. Allowing some screen time in moderation might be beneficial. Also, occasional junk food isn't inherently bad, especially if it's a treat.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are making choices based on their values. They're providing alternatives that are active and educational. The kids aren't malnourished or deprived of social interaction because they can have junk food elsewhere. Their success in school and behavior suggest the approach works for them.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe, but the parents aren't being abusive. They're setting boundaries that they believe are for their children's well-being. Until there's evidence of harm, it's a personal choice. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making decisions that align with their parenting style, which seems effective based on the kids' outcomes.\n"
