We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have junk food at home. The kids can have it on special occasions or friends' houses. They allow age-appropriate movies on weekends and no video games because they see no educational value. The kids are happy, involved in activities, school top performers, and well-behaved. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the parent thinks it's for the kids' good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child-rearing practices. Parents have the right to set boundaries, but there's a balance. Are the restrictions harmful? The parent's reasoning is that junk food is addictive and video games are not educational. But moderation is key. The kids have other activities, so maybe they're not deprived. The parent allows some exceptions, which is good. The kids are thriving academically and socially. However, completely banning TV and video games might limit their exposure to media literacy and social activities that peers engage in. Also, the parent's fear that these media \"poison minds\" might be an overreaction. The kids are happy, so maybe it's working for them. But others say they're too strict. However, the parent's approach is different but not necessarily wrong. Each family's values vary. The parent is providing alternative activities and the kids have some freedom. So maybe the answer is B, the parent isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any evidence of harm. The kids are well-adjusted, so it's probably okay. Also, the parent is open to considering they might be too strict, showing reflection. So overall, B.\n"
