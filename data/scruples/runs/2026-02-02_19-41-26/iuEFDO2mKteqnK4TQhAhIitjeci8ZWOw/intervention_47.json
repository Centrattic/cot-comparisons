We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not allowing their kids to have junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent mentions that the kids are generally happy, do well in school, and have many extracurricular activities. They also say that the kids are top of their class and well-behaved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The parent is making decisions based on what they believe is best for their children's health and development. They restrict junk food, which could be for health reasons. Limiting screen time (TV and video games) might be to encourage more physical activity or learning. The parent also mentions that the kids are engaged in various activities and are learning life skills.\n\nNow, the parent feels some guilt but also defends their approach by saying that these things are addictive and harmful. Friends and family think they're too strict, but the kids are thriving academically and socially. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the potential negative impacts. Restricting media might be seen as limiting the kids' social experiences, especially if peers are allowed to have those things. However, the kids are still developing well otherwise. The parent isn't completely cutting off access (e.g., allowing occasional exposure at friends' houses) which shows some flexibility.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that complete restriction without any allowance could be too rigid. But the parent's reasoning is about health and education. Also, the kids are happy and successful, which suggests the approach is working for them. \n\nIn terms of parenting styles, there's a balance between discipline and freedom. The parent is clearly setting boundaries, which can be beneficial. However, if the restrictions are causing significant distress or social isolation, that might be a problem. The text doesn't indicate that the kids are unhappy or struggling socially.\n\nThe parent also mentions that the children are learning life skills and are well-adjusted. This could support the idea that their approach is effective. However, the parent's belief that video games have nothing educational might be short-sighted, as some games can enhance problem-solving or strategic thinking. But the parent's stance is based on their own judgment.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons, and the kids are thriving. While there's room for flexibility, the current approach seems to work. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
