We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe parent has two kids, a 7-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter. They don't allow junk food at home, only on special occasions when they visit friends or on holidays. They don't let the kids watch TV except for an age-appropriate movie on weekends. Video games are also not allowed because they think they're not educational. The parent mentions that the kids are happy, involved in activities like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc., and are top of their class. They believe that junk food and video games are addictive and poison the mind. Some family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids have more life skills than peers.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider parenting styles. There's the strict vs. permissive approach. The parent here seems to be on the stricter side regarding media and diet. But they do allow some exceptions, like movies on weekends and special occasions. The kids are engaged in other activities, which might balance out the restrictions. \n\nI need to think about child development. Kids do need some screen time for socialization, as many peers play games or watch TV. However, the parent's restrictions are on junk food and video games, which could be seen as promoting healthier habits. The parent's reasoning is that these are addictive and not educational. But is it wrong to restrict them entirely?\n\nAlso, the kids are top of their class and well-behaved, which suggests the approach is working academically and behaviorally. The parent isn't allowing alternatives that are harmful, but maybe they're not giving the kids a chance to learn moderation. For example, if the kids are not exposed to video games at home, they might not learn how to manage that time if they encounter it elsewhere. But since the parent says the son is just starting to ask, maybe they can teach him about it in a controlled way.\n\nAnother angle: the parent's rules might limit the kids' ability to socialize. If friends have TV or games, the kids might feel left out. But the parent allows exceptions when they're at friends' houses, so maybe that's covered. The key point is whether the restrictions are harmful. The parent mentions the kids are happy, so maybe not. \n\nHowever, the parent's strictness might be too much. For example, not allowing any video games at all might prevent the kids from learning to play games that could teach problem-solving or teamwork, depending on the games. But the parent thinks they're not educational. There's a balance between protecting kids and preparing them for the world.\n\nAlso, the parent is concerned about addiction and negative effects, which is valid. But completely banning these things might not address the underlying issues and could lead to rebellion in adolescence. \n\nIn terms of life skills, the kids are learning cooking, reading, etc., which are good. The parent's justification is that their approach is working, so maybe they're not in the wrong. The question is whether the restrictions are harmful or not. If the kids are happy and successful, maybe the parent is fine.\n\nI think the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have their reasons, the kids are thriving, and they're involved in other activities. While others might disagree, there's no clear harm here. The parent is making choices based on their values, and as long as the kids are healthy and happy, it's their decision.\n"
