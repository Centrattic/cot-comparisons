We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent explains that they don't have junk food at home except for special occasions, no TV except weekend movies, and no video games since they're not educational. The kids are doing well in school, involved in activities, and have life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. Some parents believe in strict control for health and educational reasons, while others think kids need some freedom. The parent mentions that the kids are happy and successful, which is a positive outcome. But others might argue that denying all junk food and entertainment could be too restrictive.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that these things are addictive or harmful. However, moderation is often key here. Completely banning all junk food might be extreme, but allowing it only on special occasions or at friends' might be seen as balanced. TV and video games, when age-appropriate and limited, can have educational aspects. The parent doesn't allow video games at all, which some might see as overly strict, especially if they're age-appropriate.\n\nThe children's happiness and success are important factors. If the kids are content and thriving, maybe the approach works. But other parents and family think they're too strict. It's possible the parent is overprotective, but it's also a personal choice as long as the kids are safe and well-cared for.\n\nIn the end, parenting is subjective. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but the key is whether the children's needs are met. The parent might not be in the wrong if the kids are healthy and happy. However, some might argue that a bit more flexibility could be beneficial for the kids' social development, especially since they do interact with friends who might have these things. But since the parent is open to special occasions, maybe they're finding a middle ground. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the kids are doing well and the restrictions seem to be for their benefit, even if others disagree.\n"
