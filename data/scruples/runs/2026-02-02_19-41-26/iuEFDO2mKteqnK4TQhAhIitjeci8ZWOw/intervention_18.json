We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. From the description, the parent has two kids who are well-behaved, doing well in school, and involved in various activities. The parent's reasoning is that they want to avoid addictive and mind-poisoning media, and instead teach life skills. However, friends and family think they're too strict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parent is not allowing junk food at home except on special occasions. That's a common approach for health reasons. Then, TV is only allowed for age-appropriate movies on weekends. Video games are banned because the parent sees no educational value. The kids are engaged in sports, theater, learning to cook, etc., and are top of their class. They're also described as polite and well-behaved.\n\nThe parent feels maybe too strict but justifies it by saying these restrictions prevent addiction. Others think they're too harsh, but the kids have more life skills. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, some media and screen time can be beneficial in moderation. Video games can have educational aspects, like problem-solving skills, depending on the type. However, the parent's concern about addiction and lack of educational value is valid for certain games. The absence of junk food is generally seen as healthy, but complete restriction might limit kids' autonomy or social experiences if friends have it.\n\nThe kids are happy, successful, and have many activities, which suggests the parent's approach isn't harming them. But is it wrong to prohibit these things? It depends on the reasoning. If the parent is making informed decisions based on their values and the kids are thriving, maybe not. However, completely banning certain activities without allowing any flexibility could be seen as too controlling. The parent mentions other family members think they're strict, but since the kids are doing well, it's a balance between protection and freedom.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a range. Some parents use strict rules, others are more lenient. The key is if the kids' basic needs are met and they're safe. Here, the kids are healthy, happy, and well-adjusted. The parent's approach might be strict, but not necessarily wrong. The parent's reasoning\u2014avoiding addiction and promoting life skills\u2014is a valid concern. The fact that the kids are doing well academically and socially suggests the approach is working for them. However, some might argue that allowing some flexibility could help the kids develop self-regulation skills. Still, the parent's decision is within their rights as a guardian, as long as it's not harmful. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
