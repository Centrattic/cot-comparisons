We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation. The parent has two kids, a 7-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter. They don't allow junk food at home, except for special occasions or friends' houses. They also restrict TV and video games, allowing maybe a movie on weekends and no video games because they don't see any educational value. The kids are into extracurricular activities, doing well in school, and are well-behaved. The parent feels sometimes they're too strict but thinks the restrictions are good for the kids.\n\nNow, the parent is asking if they're at fault here. The question is whether they're in the wrong. The parent's reasoning is that junk food and video games are bad, and they want to prevent addiction and mind pollution. They also mention that other family and friends say they're too strict, but their kids have more life skills than peers.\n\nFirst, I should consider what's typical in parenting. Restricting junk food isn't unheard of. Many parents limit it for health reasons. Allowing it on special occasions seems reasonable. Video games and TV: some parents restrict screen time, others allow it in moderation. The key here is the parent's reasoning and the outcomes. The kids are happy, doing well academically, and have many activities. That's a positive sign.\n\nBut when does it become too strict? If the restrictions are causing harm or making the kids unhappy. The parent says the kids are happy most of the time. The son is starting to ask to play video games, but the parent is saying no. The parent's concern is about addiction and lack of educational value. However, video games can have educational aspects, like problem-solving, and some games are designed to teach skills. But the parent is not allowing them at all, which might be extreme.\n\nAlso, the parent is making a decision based on their own beliefs without considering the potential benefits of moderate screen time. For example, some kids use video games as a way to socialize with peers. If the kids are missing out on activities their friends do, it might lead to social isolation. But the parent mentions the kids have other activities, so maybe that's not the case here.\n\nAnother angle: the parent is trying to instill good habits, which can be beneficial. However, being too strict can backfire. The parent's justification that they're protecting the kids might be valid, but the approach could be rigid. The key is balance. For example, allowing some screen time with parental guidance instead of an outright ban. The fact that the parent is questioning their approach shows they're aware of possible strictness, which is a good sign.\n\nIn terms of junk food, not having it at home is common. The kids can have it elsewhere, which is a middle ground. The video game and TV restrictions are more about the parent's control over their child's activities. If the kids are not being forced to do things they dislike and are engaged in other enriching activities, maybe it's not harmful. But if the child is in a different situation, like peers having access and the child feeling deprived, that could affect their social life.\n\nThe parent's reasoning that video games are addictive and poison minds is a common concern, but research shows that moderate gaming isn't inherently bad. The parent's approach might be based on a fear that's not entirely evidence-based. Also, the idea that all video games are non-educational is incorrect; there are educational games like Minecraft or others that teach problem-solving or creativity.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the parent is making decisions based on their values and beliefs, which have resulted in well-adjusted children. However, the strictness in some areas (no video games at all, minimal TV) might be overstepping, especially if there's no flexibility. The parent is not wrong in all aspects, but there might be room for adjustment. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the kids are happy and doing well, and the parent is making informed choices, the answer might be that they are not in the wrong. But if the restrictions are harmful in any way, they could be. The key is that the parent is not causing harm and the kids are thriving. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
