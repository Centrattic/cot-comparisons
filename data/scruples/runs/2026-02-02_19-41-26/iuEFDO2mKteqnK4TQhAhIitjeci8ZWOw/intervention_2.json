We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The parent has two kids, a 7-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl. They don't keep junk food at home, unless it's a special occasion or a friend's house. They allow age-appropriate movies on weekends but no TV otherwise. Video games are prohibited because the parent thinks they're not educational. The kids are involved in extracurricular activities, do well in school, and have good behavior. However, the parent feels some guilt about being strict but believes the restrictions are necessary to avoid addiction and protect their minds. Friends and family say they're too strict, but the kids have life skills.\n\nNow, considering parenting styles. The parent is enforcing strict rules to promote healthy habits and education. They provide alternatives like sports, theater, cooking, reading, outdoor play, etc. The kids are thriving academically and socially, which suggests the approach might be effective. However, the question is whether this is in the wrong.\n\nIn many cultures, parents have the right to set boundaries for their children's well-being. The parent's rationale is about protecting the kids from what they see as harmful media and food. However, complete restrictions might be seen as overly controlling, especially if it denies the children some forms of entertainment that are common among peers. But the kids are happy and engaged in other activities, which balances it out.\n\nThe key factors are: the children's well-being, the parents' intentions, and the balance of freedoms. The parent is providing enriching alternatives, which is positive. However, some might argue that a bit of flexibility, like allowing limited screen time or occasional junk food, could teach kids moderation and self-regulation. But the parent's approach seems to be about protecting the kids from what they perceive as negative influences.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, parents have the authority to make decisions in their children's best interests. Since the kids are well-adjusted, healthy, and the parent's rules are consistent with promoting a balanced lifestyle, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. However, the strictness could be seen as too rigid if it doesn't allow for any flexibility as the children grow. But given the context provided, where the kids are thriving, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
