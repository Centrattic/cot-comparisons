We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the parent's reasoning. They mention not allowing junk food except on special occasions. The kids sometimes beg but are generally okay with what they have. They do allow age-appropriate movies on weekends. Video games are off-limits because they see no educational value. The children are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the kids have more life skills. The parent is concerned about addiction and negative effects from these media and food.\n\nNow, considering child-rearing practices, there's a balance between discipline and flexibility. The parent's approach seems strict, but the kids are thriving academically and socially. Allowing junk food only occasionally is a common approach to teach moderation. Banning TV and video games entirely might be seen as restrictive, but the parent does allow movies on weekends, which could be a middle ground. The key is whether these restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are engaged in other activities and are well-adjusted, maybe it's okay. However, some might argue that kids need some unstructured play and exposure to media as part of normal development. But the parent's stance is that they focus on life skills and education, which seems to be working. The question is subjective, but the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong if the kids are happy and developing well. So the answer might be B.\n"
