We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author has two kids and doesn't allow them to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. They allow exceptions for friends' houses or special occasions. The kids are doing well academically and are involved in activities like sports and theatre. The parents feel they might be too strict but argue that the restrictions help prevent addiction and teach life skills. Others say they're too strict, but their kids are well-adjusted and successful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents are making choices based on their beliefs about health, education, and screen time. They provide alternatives like extracurriculars, cooking, reading, etc. The kids are top of their class and well-behaved. The parents are concerned about addiction and mind pollution from media and junk food. \n\nI should think about parenting styles. Authoritarian vs. authoritative. The parents are strict but seem to provide structure and positive activities. The kids are happy and thriving, which might indicate a healthy environment. However, other parents and family members think they're too strict. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible arguments for the author being in the wrong (A): They're restricting things that many kids have, which might limit social experiences (like playing video games with friends). Also, some argue that moderation is better, and total bans might be too rigid. Also, kids might miss out on learning self-control if they're never exposed.\n\nArguments against being in the wrong (B): The kids are happy, successful, and have a balanced life with other activities. The parents' intentions to avoid addiction and promote life skills are valid. The exceptions for friends and special events mean they're not completely cut off. The kids are thriving, which is a good indicator.\n\nI need to weigh these. The parents' approach seems to be working for their kids, but other people have different opinions. The key is whether the parents are wrong. Since the children are not showing signs of distress and are successful, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Parenting is subjective, and different approaches work for different families. The author's reasoning is based on their values and what they believe is best for their children. Others may disagree, but as long as the kids are healthy and well-adjusted, it's not necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
