We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their parenting choices. The parent doesn't allow their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. They have some exceptions, like special occasions or movies on weekends. The kids are happy, involved in activities, and do well in school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different parenting styles. Some might see strictness as bad, but others might think it's good for discipline. The parent mentions that the kids have other activities and life skills. They also get praised for their behavior. \n\nBut is there a line where it's too strict? The parent's reasoning is that junk food is unhealthy, TV and games are addictive and not educational. But some might argue that kids need some screen time or treats for balance. The parent allows exceptions, so maybe it's not completely restrictive.\n\nAlso, the kids are top of their class, well-behaved. That's a plus. However, the parent is questioning if they're being too harsh. The other side could say that denying all junk food and screen time might affect the kids' social life if friends have it, leading to teasing or isolation. But the parent says the kids are happy, so maybe that's not the case here.\n\nI need to think about child development. Some studies suggest that moderate screen time and treats can be okay. But the parent's approach is more strict. The key is whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are happy, healthy, and successful, maybe the approach works for them. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if their kids are well-adjusted. Parenting is subjective. The answer would be B (No) because the parent's methods have positive outcomes, and they are providing alternatives. Others may have different views, but there's no clear wrongdoing here.\n"
