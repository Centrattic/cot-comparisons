We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent mentions that the kids are happy, do a lot of activities, and are top of their class. They feel they're being strict but think the restrictions are for the kids' good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child-rearing practices. Parents have different approaches. Some might think that completely banning certain activities is too strict, while others might appreciate the structure. The parent allows exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions, which shows they're not entirely cut off. \n\nJunk food: The kids can have it sometimes, so maybe the issue is the zero tolerance at home. But it's a parent's choice to limit unhealthy food for health reasons. TV and video games: The parent allows one movie a weekend and no video games because they see no educational value. The kids are engaged in other activities, so maybe the parent is substituting with better options.\n\nThe parent is concerned about addiction and negative effects, which are valid worries. Others say they're too strict, but the kids are well-adjusted and successful. So is it wrong? It depends on the balance. If the kids are thriving and the parent's intentions are good, maybe not. But some might argue that complete bans can be too restrictive. However, the parent is providing alternatives. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the parent's approach seems to be working, and they have valid reasons. The key factors are the kids' well-being and development. Since the kids are happy and successful, the parent's methods might be effective. So the answer is B.\n"
