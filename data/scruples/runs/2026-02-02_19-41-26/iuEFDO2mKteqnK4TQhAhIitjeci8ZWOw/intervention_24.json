We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The author mentions that the kids are happy, do well in school, and have many extracurricular activities. They also say that the kids get to watch a movie on weekends and have friends over sometimes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for and against. On one hand, the author is making decisions they believe are in the kids' best interest, promoting healthy habits and education. The kids are doing well academically and socially, which suggests the approach might be effective. Some people might argue that it's a parent's right to set boundaries for their children's upbringing.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that completely banning certain activities could be too restrictive. Kids do watch TV and play games in moderation, so maybe the author's approach is extreme. Also, video games can have educational aspects, and denying them entirely might take away opportunities for social interaction or skill development. However, the author does allow for some flexibility with occasional exceptions and weekend movies.\n\nThe key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. The kids are happy and well-adjusted, so the author's methods aren't causing harm. The author also mentions that other family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids are thriving. It's possible that the author's approach is working for their family, even if others disagree.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Parents have different philosophies. As long as the kids are safe, healthy, and their needs are met, the approach is valid. The author isn't forcing the kids into something harmful; they're making choices based on their values. The kids also have the chance to engage in other activities, which balances their activities.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their methods might not fit everyone's opinion, but they're not harmful. The answer would be B (No).\n"
