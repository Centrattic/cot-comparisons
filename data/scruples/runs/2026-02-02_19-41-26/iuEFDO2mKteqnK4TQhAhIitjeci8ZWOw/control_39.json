We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down their approach. They don't allow junk food, TV, or video games at home. The kids can have junk food on special occasions or at friends' houses, which is a reasonable compromise. The parents mention that the kids sometimes beg but are generally okay with their diet.\n\nNext, they restrict TV to age-appropriate movies on weekends. So it's not a complete ban, just limited. For video games, they say there's nothing educational about them and the son is asking to play, but they say no. The parents argue that the kids are involved in other activities like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. The kids are doing well academically and are well-behaved, according to the parents and others.\n\nOther family and friends think they're too strict, but the parents believe their kids have more life skills. They express some doubt about being harsh but think the restrictions prevent addiction and mind pollution.\n\nSo, I need to decide if these restrictions are wrong. From a parenting perspective, there's a range of acceptable practices. Some parents limit screen time and junk food for health and developmental reasons. The fact that the kids are happy and successful in other areas suggests the approach might be working. However, completely banning video games could be seen as overly restrictive, especially since some games can have educational or cognitive benefits. But the parents have their reasoning. The key is whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are engaged in other activities and the parents are providing alternatives, maybe it's not wrong. Also, the kids are allowed some flexibility (TV on weekends, special occasions for junk food). The parents are also considering the long-term benefits, so it's hard to say they're in the wrong. Different parenting styles exist, and unless there's harm, it's subjective. So, the answer might be B.\n"
