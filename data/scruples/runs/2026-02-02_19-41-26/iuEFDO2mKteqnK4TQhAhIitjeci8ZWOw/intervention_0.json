We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable not to allow children to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent mentions that their kids are happy, involved in activities, and doing well in school. They also allow some exceptions, like special occasions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The parent thinks junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. They do provide alternatives like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. The kids are top of their class and well-behaved. \n\nNow, is it wrong to have these restrictions? Well, parenting styles vary. Some parents might allow more screen time or occasional junk food. The key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. The kids seem to be thriving in terms of academics and behavior. They have other activities to engage with. \n\nThe parent acknowledges that other family and friends think they're too strict, but they believe the restrictions are for the kids' good. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of potential issues, I wonder if completely banning certain things might be too rigid. For example, allowing some TV time could help kids develop media literacy. Also, video games can have educational aspects if chosen appropriately, though the parent doesn't think they're educational. But the parent is making a judgment call based on their beliefs. \n\nHowever, the kids are happy and not showing signs of distress. The parent's approach seems to be creating a structured environment with a focus on life skills. There's a balance between discipline and flexibility. But as long as the children's basic needs are met and they're not being neglected, the parent might not be in the wrong. \n\nMaybe the issue is whether the restrictions are too absolute. Allowing zero junk food at home is strict, but if it's occasional at friends' places, maybe it's manageable. Similarly, no video games might limit social interaction if peers play together. But the parent argues against the educational value, which is their prerogative. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent's approach might be unconventional, but if the children are healthy, happy, and well-adjusted, it's not necessarily wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong). However, there's a fine line between discipline and over-control. If the restrictions are causing the kids to feel isolated or deprived, that could be an issue. But based on the given info, the children seem to be doing well. So the answer would be B.\n"
