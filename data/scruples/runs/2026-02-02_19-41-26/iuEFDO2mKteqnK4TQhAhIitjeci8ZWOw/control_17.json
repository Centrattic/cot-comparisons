We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent's reasoning is that they want to avoid addictive or harmful content and focus on educational activities. The kids are doing well in school, are polite, and involved in extracurriculars.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. There's a balance between being protective and being overly restrictive. The parent is making choices based on their beliefs about what's best for the children's health and development. On the other hand, some might argue that kids need some freedom to explore and make their own choices, even if it includes things like TV or video games in moderation.\n\nThe parent mentions that the kids have access to movies on weekends and can have junk food at friends' houses. That shows flexibility, which is a good sign. Also, the kids are engaged in various activities and are successful academically and socially. The parent's concern is valid if they believe these restrictions are in the children's best interest.\n\nOther people, like family and friends, think they're too strict, but the parent counters that their kids have more life skills. The key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. If the children are happy and well-adjusted, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. However, completely banning things like video games might deprive kids of social opportunities or problem-solving skills that games can offer.\n\nBut the parent is clear that they don't see educational value in video games. It's their choice as a parent to set those boundaries. The children aren't being neglected; they're involved in other activities. The main question is whether the parent crossed a line. Since the kids are thriving and the restrictions are consistent with the parent's values, it's likely that the parent isn't in the wrong. So, the answer would be B.\n"
