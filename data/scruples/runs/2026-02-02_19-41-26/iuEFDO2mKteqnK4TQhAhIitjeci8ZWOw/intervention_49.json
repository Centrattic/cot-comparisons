We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The parent has strict rules about no junk food, TV, or video games at home. The kids are allowed to watch a movie on weekends and can have junk food at friends' houses or special events. The parent justifies this by saying they focus on other activities and the kids are doing well academically and are well-behaved. Friends and family think they're too strict, but the parent feels it's for the kids' good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. There's the authoritarian approach, which is strict with high expectations, and the permissive approach, which is more lenient. The parent here seems authoritative, setting clear rules but allowing some flexibility (like weekend movies and exceptions for friends' houses). Authoritative parenting is generally considered effective because it balances discipline with warmth and communication.\n\nThe parent mentions that the kids are happy, involved in activities, and successful in school. That's a good sign. They also teach life skills, which is beneficial. The key points are whether the restrictions are harmful. Junk food, TV, and video games in moderation aren't inherently bad. However, the parent's reasoning includes protecting the kids from \"addictive\" and \"poisonous\" content, which is a common concern. The question is if the restrictions are too extreme.\n\nBut the parent allows exceptions, like watching a movie on weekends. That shows some leniency. Also, the kids are getting enough physical activity and social interaction through sports, theater, and playing outside. Social development is important, and the kids are exposed to friends through events where junk food is present. \n\nThe parent's concern about video games being non-educational is a point, but not all video games are bad; some can teach problem-solving. However, the parent isn't denying all screen time, just video games. The kids can still watch age-appropriate movies, which might be a form of educational content or just entertainment.\n\nThe friends and family think the parent is too strict, but the parent's approach seems to be working as the kids are well-adjusted. The parent might be overcautious, but if the kids are thriving, maybe it's okay. It's also possible that the parent's rules could be too restrictive if they're not allowing any form of leisure that the kids enjoy, but the parent mentions they play games and read together. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the parent is trying to protect the kids from potential harms, and the outcomes are positive. However, some might argue that denying all junk food, TV, and video games could prevent the kids from learning self-regulation and balance. But since the parent allows exceptions and the kids are getting other positive experiences, maybe it's not the parent's fault. \n\nLooking at the options, the user thinks the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to determine. If the parent is being too strict and not allowing any flexibility in their home, but the kids are still getting some exposure through friends and the parent allows movies, it's a balance. Since the kids are happy and successful, and the restrictions are not causing harm, the parent might not be in the wrong (B). However, if the restrictions are too harsh without any leeway, even in the home, but the parent does allow some exceptions, it's a gray area. \n\nConsidering all factors, I think the parent is not in the wrong. Their approach seems to work, the kids are well-adjusted, and they have a balanced life with other activities. While there's room for flexibility, the parent's intentions are good and the outcomes are positive. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
