We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent mentions that there's no junk food at home, but they allow it on special occasions. They also restrict TV to one movie a week and no video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are happy, in extracurriculars, and top of their class. Others say they're too strict, but the parent feels they're teaching life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parent is concerned about the kids' health and education, which is valid. They provide alternative activities like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, etc. The kids are doing well academically and socially. The parent is worried about addiction and negative effects of media. But friends and family think they're too strict. \n\nThe question is about whether the parent is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms, the kids' well-being, and balance. The parent is making choices they believe are for the kids' benefit, but others might see it as overly restrictive. The kids seem content and successful, which suggests the approach is working for them. However, completely banning something like video games might seem harsh, especially if it's a common activity among peers. But the parent has a reason\u2014no educational value. \n\nIn terms of child welfare, as long as the kids are not being neglected or harmed, and they're engaged in positive activities, it might not be wrong. The parent is also allowing exceptions for friends' houses and special events, which gives the kids some exposure. The key is whether the restrictions are reasonable. Some might argue that moderate exposure to TV or video games can be okay, but the parent's stance is clear. Since the kids are thriving, maybe the parent is not in the wrong. But others might say that complete bans can lead to rebellion or social issues later. However, the parent is not neglecting them; they're providing enriching activities. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent's methods are working, and the kids are happy and successful. But I need to check if there's any red flags. No abuse, no lack of social interaction, they have outlets. The parent is also flexible with exceptions. So, probably B.\n"
