We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food or use screens. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they have strict rules. The kids are well-behaved, top of their class, and involved in activities. Other people think they're too strict, but the parent thinks it's for the kids' good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different parenting styles. Some parents believe in strict control for health and education, others think kids should have some freedom. The parent mentions they allow exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions, so it's not entirely restrictive. They also provide alternatives like cooking, sports, and reading. The kids seem happy and successful.\n\nBut there's a line between good discipline and being too harsh. The parent's reasoning includes addiction and mind-poisoning, which might be extreme. Also, the kids are still young, and some screen time or junk food in moderation is common. However, the parent's approach has produced well-adjusted kids, so maybe it's working. But is it wrong?\n\nThe question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Legal or moral wrongness? Probably moral. Depending on cultural norms, strict parenting isn't necessarily wrong if the kids are healthy and happy. But some might argue that kids should have some autonomy. The parent's justification is for the kids' benefit. It's a tough call. Since the kids are thriving and the parent isn't harming them, maybe they're not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
