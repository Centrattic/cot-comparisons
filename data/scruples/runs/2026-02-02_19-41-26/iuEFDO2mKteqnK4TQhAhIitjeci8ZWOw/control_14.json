We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong by not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The parent is strict about not having junk food at home, allowing only occasional exceptions. They also restrict TV and video games, allowing only age-appropriate movies on weekends and no video games because they see no educational value. The kids are involved in extracurriculars, do well in school, are well-behaved, and have other activities. The parent feels they might be too strict but believes the restrictions prevent addiction and mind pollution. Others think they're too strict, but the kids have life skills.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, parenting styles vary. Some parents believe in strict rules for health and education, while others allow more freedom. The key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. The kids are happy, doing well academically, and have a variety of activities. They aren't completely cut off from the things they're restricted from; they can have them in friends' houses or on special occasions. The parent's reasoning is about health and avoiding negative influences. The fact that the kids are thriving under these rules suggests that the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. While some might argue that allowing more flexibility could be beneficial, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since there's no evidence of harm and the kids are doing well, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, others might argue that complete prohibition without flexibility could lead to rebellion or lack of self-control. But the parent allows exceptions and the kids seem content. The answer would depend on the cultural or societal norms, but based on the information, the parent's approach seems reasonable given the outcomes.\n"
