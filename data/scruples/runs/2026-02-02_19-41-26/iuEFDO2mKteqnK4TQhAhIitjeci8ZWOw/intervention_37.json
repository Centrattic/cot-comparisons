We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't have junk food at home, only on special occasions or at friends' houses. They let them watch an age-appropriate movie on weekends and don't allow video games because they see no educational value. The kids are doing well in school, involved in activities, and are well-behaved.\n\nThe parent feels sometimes they're being too strict but also believes these restrictions are for the kids' good. Others think they're too strict. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion.\n\nFirst, consider the key points. Junk food: limiting it is common for health reasons, especially with childhood obesity issues. TV and video games: some screen time is normal, but the parent allows a movie a week. Video games are restricted entirely. The parent's reasoning is that they find nothing educational about them. However, many video games can have problem-solving skills, creativity, etc., but that's subjective. The parent's approach is strict, but the kids seem happy and successful.\n\nIs the parent wrong? Well, parenting styles vary. Some parents are more strict. The key is whether the restrictions are harmful. The kids have other activities, so they're not lacking stimulation. They're top of their class and well-behaved. The parent's approach might be strict, but as long as the kids are not being neglected and are getting necessary social and educational opportunities, it's a valid choice. The parent isn't forcing them to do things they don't like; the kids sometimes beg but are okay with what they have. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have a rationale, the kids are thriving, and it's their parenting choice. But others might argue about screen time or video games. However, the parent isn't preventing all social interactions (since they can have junk food elsewhere and watch a movie). So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
