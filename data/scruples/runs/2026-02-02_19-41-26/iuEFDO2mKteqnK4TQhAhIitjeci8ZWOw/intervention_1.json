We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent who restricts their kids from junk food, TV, and video games is in the wrong. They provided the parent's situation where the kids are top of their class, well-behaved, and have lots of extracurriculars. The parent feels it's for their own good to avoid addiction and mind pollution, but others think they're too strict.\n\nHmm, the parent is doing what they believe is right for their kids' development. They mention the kids are happy and have other activities. The question is whether this restriction is wrong. \n\nWell, child-rearing is subjective. There's no one-size-fits-all approach. The parent's reasoning is based on avoiding junk food's health risks and non-educational media. The kids aren't being deprived entirely\u2014there's allowance for special occasions and weekend movies. Also, the kids have other enriching activities. \n\nBut some might argue that occasional TV or video games are normal for kids, promoting relaxation and social interaction. However, the parent's stance is that these aren't educational. Yet, other activities the kids are involved in might cover educational aspects. \n\nThe parent is concerned about addiction and mind pollution, which is a common worry. The fact that the kids are well-adjusted and successful in school suggests the approach might be working. Others may criticize the strictness, but the parent's intention is to foster life skills and discipline. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, since parenting styles vary and the kids are thriving under this setup, it's hard to say the parent is in the wrong. The key points are the kids' happiness, academic performance, and the balance of activities. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
