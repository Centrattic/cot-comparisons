We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, or video games. The parent has two kids who are doing well academically and behaviorally, and they engage in various activities. \n\nFirst, the parent restricts junk food except for special occasions. That seems reasonable because moderation is key, and it's not entirely banned. Then, TV is allowed once a week for a movie, which gives some flexibility. Video games are prohibited because the parent thinks they're not educational. The kids are involved in sports, theater, cooking, etc., which are beneficial.\n\nThe parent is told they're too strict by others, but the kids are happy and successful. The question is whether this is wrong. The parent's reasoning is that they want to avoid addiction and negative media influence. They also emphasize life skills.\n\nI need to consider child development. Kids need a balance. While structure is good, some unstructured play and screen time can be beneficial for creativity and social skills. However, the parent is allowing some screen time (movies) and the kids are content. Also, the parent is providing alternative activities. \n\nBut the parent is denying video games entirely. Are there educational games? Some games can improve problem-solving. However, the parent might have valid concerns about addiction. On the other hand, completely restricting might not be necessary if there's supervision.\n\nThe key is whether the restrictions are harmful. The kids are happy and successful, so maybe it's not wrong. The parent is making choices based on their values and what they believe is best. There's no evidence the kids are suffering. Other parents might do things differently, but that doesn't mean it's wrong. Cultural differences also play a role. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the approach is working for their family.\n"
