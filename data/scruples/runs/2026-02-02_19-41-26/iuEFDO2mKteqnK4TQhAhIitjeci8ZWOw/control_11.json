We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The parent doesn't allow junk food, TV, or video games for their kids. They mention that the children are doing well in school, have many extracurricular activities, and are well-behaved. Some family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent believes the restrictions are for the kids' good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance between discipline and being overly restrictive. Junk food, TV, and video games are common in many households, but the parent is choosing to limit these. The key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. The children are happy and successful, so maybe the approach isn't causing harm. Also, the parent mentions that the kids get exposure to these things on special occasions, which might give them some social experience.\n\nHowever, the parent's reasoning that video games are \"not educational\" is a bit simplistic. Some games do have educational aspects, but maybe the parent is focusing on avoiding what they see as addictions. The fact that the kids are involved in various activities suggests they have other ways to engage and learn.\n\nThe question is about whether the parent is wrong. The term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) is subjective. In parenting, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. If the kids are healthy, happy, and learning, the parent might not be in the wrong. But if the restrictions are too severe and prevent the kids from experiencing normal childhood activities, that could be an issue. However, the parent allows some exceptions and the kids are thriving. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). The parent's strictness seems to have positive outcomes, and while others might disagree, as long as the kids are well-adjusted and not being deprived of necessary social or educational experiences, the parent isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
