We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the parent has two kids, 7 and 9. They don't have junk food at home, only on special occasions. They allow one movie a week. No video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are still doing well in school, have many activities, and are described as well-behaved. The parent feels maybe they're being too strict but also believes these restrictions are for the kids' good. Others say they're too strict, but the kids have more life skills.\n\nI need to consider child-rearing practices. There's a balance between setting boundaries and being overly restrictive. The parent isn't allowing any junk food, which is strict but maybe for health reasons. However, completely banning all screen time (TV and video games) could be an issue. Some experts suggest limited screen time, but zero might be too much. Also, video games can have educational aspects, but the parent is against all of them. The kids are doing well academically and have other activities, so maybe the restrictions aren't harmful.\n\nBut is it right to have no flexibility? The parent allows movies once a week, which is some screen time. The key is whether these rules are harmful. The kids are happy, so maybe the parent's approach is working. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms and what's considered acceptable parenting. In some views, the parent is doing a good job, in others, too strict. But the kids are thriving, so maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
