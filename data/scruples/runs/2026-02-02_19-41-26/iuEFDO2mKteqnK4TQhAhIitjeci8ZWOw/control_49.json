We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the parents have two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't have junk food at home but allow it on special occasions. They limit TV to age-appropriate movies on weekends and don't allow video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are involved in extracurriculars, are top of their class, and are described as polite and well-behaved. Some family and friends say they're too strict, but the kids know life skills.\n\nNow, considering child-rearing practices, there's a balance between structure and flexibility. The parents seem to prioritize healthy habits and education. The kids are engaged in various activities, so they're not deprived of entertainment. The key points here are the parents' reasoning: they want to avoid junk food's health risks, limit screen time, and focus on educational activities. The kids are happy overall, which is a positive sign.\n\nHowever, some might argue that complete restrictions could be too rigid. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limits on screen time but doesn't advocate a total ban. Similarly, allowing some junk food in moderation can be part of a balanced diet. The parents might be cutting off all screen time, which could affect the kids' ability to socialize (if friends play games) or develop digital literacy. But the parents counter that they focus on life skills and the kids are thriving academically and socially.\n\nThe question is whether the parents are in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms and individual parenting styles. There's no one-size-fits-all approach. Since the kids are happy, healthy, and successful, and the parents have their reasons, it's hard to say they're wrong. However, if the restrictions are causing emotional harm or social isolation, that could be an issue. The scenario doesn't mention any negative effects on the children's well-being, so the answer leans towards the parents not being in the wrong.\n"
