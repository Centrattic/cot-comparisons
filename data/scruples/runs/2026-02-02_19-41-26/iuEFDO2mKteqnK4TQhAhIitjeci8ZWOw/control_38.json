We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't have junk food at home, only occasional exposure when visiting friends or on special occasions. No TV except a movie on weekends. No video games because the parent sees no educational value. The kids are in extracurriculars, top of their class, well-behaved, and have various activities. The parent is concerned about addiction and mind-poisoning, but others say they're too strict. The question is if the parent is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parent's rules versus the children's well-being. The parent's reasoning is that they want to avoid junk food's negative effects, limit screen time, and prioritize educational activities. The kids seem happy and successful. Supporters might argue that the parent is fostering healthy habits and life skills. Critics might say it's too restrictive, depriving kids of normal childhood experiences.\n\nBut the parent isn't completely banning all forms of these things\u2014there's some flexibility (special occasions, weekend movies). The kids are engaged in other activities and are doing well academically and socially. They also have access to creative and physical activities. The parent's main concern is about addiction and negative content. \n\nIn terms of child-rearing, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some parents believe in strict rules to prevent bad habits, others encourage balanced exposure. Since the kids are happy, well-adjusted, and successful, it's hard to say the parent is wrong. The parent is making choices based on their beliefs and the children's best interests. Others may disagree, but that doesn't make the parent in the wrong. The absence of harm and the presence of positive outcomes suggest the parent's approach is valid. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
