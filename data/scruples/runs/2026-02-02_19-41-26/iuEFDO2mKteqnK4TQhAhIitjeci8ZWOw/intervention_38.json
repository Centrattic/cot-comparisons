We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent in the given scenario is in the wrong. The parent doesn't allow their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. They mention that the kids are happy, involved in activities, and top of their class. Family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent believes they're avoiding addictive and harmful content.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Junk food restriction: some parents do this for health reasons. TV and video games: there's research on screen time affecting child development, but moderation is key. The parent allows some exceptions, like movies on weekends. The kids are engaged in other activities and seem well-adjusted.\n\nBut the parent is being asked if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But from the description, the parent's rules are strict but the kids are thriving. There's a balance here. However, completely banning all junk food and screen time might be too rigid. Some flexibility could be beneficial for social reasons, like when they visit friends. Also, video games can have educational elements, even if the parent disagrees. The kids are allowed some screen time with movies, so maybe the video game ban is too strict without exception.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is about avoiding addiction and negative influences, which is a valid concern. However, the kids are at an age where they might need to learn self-regulation and make their own choices within boundaries. The parent might be overstepping by not allowing any flexibility, especially if the kids are begging and seem okay with their current setup. The friends and family think they're too strict, which could indicate a cultural or social norm difference.\n\nOn the other hand, the kids are happy, successful, and well-behaved. The parent's approach seems to be working in terms of outcomes. The question is whether the methods are wrong. Some might argue that the parent's strictness is unnecessary if the kids are thriving. Others might say that the parent is protecting their children from potential harms. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and impact. The parent's intent is to provide a healthy environment, and the impact shows the kids are well-adjusted. However, the lack of flexibility in some areas might be seen as too controlling. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the parent's methods are resulting in positive outcomes, but others might see the strictness as too harsh. The user thinks A, but I'm leaning towards B because the parent's approach isn't harming the kids and they're thriving.\n"
