We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, who are doing well academically and have various activities. The parent's reasoning is that junk food is unhealthy, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. They allow some exceptions like on special occasions or a weekend movie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parent is making choices based on health and education concerns. The kids are happy, engaged in extracurriculars, and well-behaved. Other family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids have life skills. The parent is questioning if they're being harsh.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, some restrictions are common. Parents often set boundaries for healthy habits. However, completely banning TV and video games might be seen as strict. The American Academy of Pediatrics allows some screen time for children, so maybe the parent's zero tolerance is extreme.\n\nThe kids don't seem to be suffering; they're top of their class and happy. But are they missing out on social activities? If their peers are allowed these things, maybe the kids feel left out. However, the parent allows exceptions when they're with friends, so maybe that mitigates some of that.\n\nThe parent's argument is that these activities are harmful. Junk food can lead to health issues, but allowing it on special occasions might be balanced. Video games are not educational, but some games can have educational elements. The parent might be missing out on potential benefits of moderate gaming, like problem-solving skills or social interaction.\n\nThe main question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The answer depends on context. If the kids are thriving and there's no evidence of harm from the restrictions, the parent might not be in the wrong. However, being completely strict without any flexibility could be seen as overly controlling. On the other hand, promoting healthy habits and life skills is positive. The parent's approach seems to work for their children, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. But others might argue that some flexibility is better for the kids' social development. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the children are well-adjusted and the parent's intentions are for their well-being. However, there's a balance to be struck. The parent's methods might be strict, but if they're not causing harm, it's not necessarily wrong. The key is that the kids are happy and successful, so the parent's approach is working for them.\n"
