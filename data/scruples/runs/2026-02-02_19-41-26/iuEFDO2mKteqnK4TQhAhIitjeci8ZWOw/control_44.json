We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent has two kids who are well-behaved, top of their class, and involved in activities. They do allow some exceptions like movies on weekends and special occasions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. The parent is setting clear boundaries. They mention that the kids are happy and have other activities. The children are learning life skills, which is a plus. But some might argue that total restriction without any flexibility could be too strict.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. However, some might say moderation is better than an outright ban. Kids need some downtime and social activities, like playing video games with friends. The parent's approach could affect the kids' ability to socialize if their friends have access to these things.\n\nAlso, the parent's own feelings of being harsh suggest internal conflict. The support from friends and family indicating they're too strict is another point. However, the kids are thriving academically and socially, which implies the approach might be working for them. \n\nBut is it right? There's no one-size-fits-all in parenting. Cultural factors, the child's personality, and the parent's values play a role. The parent's intention is to protect the kids from harmful influences, but allowing some flexibility might help the kids learn self-regulation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parent's approach has merits, the lack of any allowance might be too strict. However, since the kids are well-adjusted and the parent has their best interest in mind, it's a balance. The answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards not being in the wrong since the parent is making conscious decisions for their children's well-being.\n"
