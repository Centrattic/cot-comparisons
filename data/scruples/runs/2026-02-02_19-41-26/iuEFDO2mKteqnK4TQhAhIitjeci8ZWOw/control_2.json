We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent's reasoning is that they don't want their kids exposed to what they see as harmful or uneducational content. The kids are happy, involved in activities, and do well in school. Other people think they're too strict, but the parent is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the parent is setting boundaries to promote healthy habits and prevent addiction. They mention the kids have alternative activities and are doing well academically and socially. On the other hand, some might argue that kids need some freedom and exposure to these things to learn balance and make their own choices later.\n\nThe key points here are the child's well-being, the parent's intentions, and the balance between restriction and freedom. The parent isn't being abusive, but they are making strict rules. The kids are not being neglected; they have other enriching activities. Also, the parent allows occasional exposure when visiting others, which shows they're not completely prohibiting it. \n\nChild development experts often emphasize the importance of moderation and teaching children to make healthy choices rather than strict prohibition. However, the parent's approach seems to be working for their kids, who are happy and successful. There's no evidence of harm. The parent's concern about addiction and negative influence is a valid one, but they should also consider allowing some autonomy as the kids grow older.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no one-size-fits-all answer, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. Their approach is strict but doesn't appear harmful. The kids are thriving, which suggests the method is effective for their family. However, the parent might want to reassess as the children get older to allow more independent decision-making. So the answer would be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
