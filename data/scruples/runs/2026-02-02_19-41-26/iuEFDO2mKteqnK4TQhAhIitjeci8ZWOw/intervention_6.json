We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent mentions that their children are happy, involved in activities, and top of their class. Others have called them strict, but the parent feels it's necessary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. The parent is implementing strict rules, but there's a balance between being strict and being authoritarian. The key here is whether these rules are harmful or beneficial. The parent argues that junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive, and that they prioritize life skills and education. The kids are happy and successful, which is a positive outcome.\n\nBut then, is it wrong to restrict these things? Some might argue that children need some freedom to explore and make their own choices, even with guidance. However, the parent is allowing exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions, which shows flexibility. Also, the kids are engaged in other activities, so they aren't completely deprived of entertainment. \n\nThe line between being protective and being too strict can be blurry. The parent's reasoning is that they want to avoid addiction and negative influences, which is a common parental concern. However, completely banning certain activities might not be the best approach. Allowing moderate exposure under supervision could teach kids self-regulation. \n\nBut in this case, the parent's approach seems to be working for their children, as the kids are happy and successful. The parent also mentions that the children don't really miss the junk food, which suggests that the restrictions aren't causing major distress. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that denying children all forms of media and snacks could be overly controlling. But the parent is providing alternatives, which is important. The children aren't left without activities; they have sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. \n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's approach is strict but the outcomes are positive. The question is whether being strict makes them wrong. Different parenting philosophies exist, and what works for one family might not for another. Since the kids are thriving, it's hard to say the parent is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
