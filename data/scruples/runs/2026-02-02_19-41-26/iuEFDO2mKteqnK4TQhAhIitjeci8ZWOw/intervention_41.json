We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the parent in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to have junk food, watch TV, or play video games. They mentioned the kids are happy, do well in school, and have many extracurricular activities. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. The parent is setting strict boundaries, which can be beneficial for discipline and healthy habits. But there's a line between being strict and being too restrictive. The kids aren't allowed any junk food, which might be okay if it's not causing harm, but completely banning all screen time and video games could affect their social development, especially if peers are allowed to do those things.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that junk food is addictive and video games are not educational. While that's a common belief, it's not universally true. Video games can have educational aspects, and moderation is key. Also, kids need to learn to manage screen time themselves eventually. By never allowing any, the parent might be depriving them of learning how to balance it.\n\nThe children are doing well academically and have many activities, but social skills might be affected if they can't interact with peers who do watch TV or play games. The parent mentions the kids are happy, but happiness doesn't necessarily mean they aren't missing out on age-appropriate experiences.\n\nOther family and friends think they're too strict, which suggests there's a cultural or generational difference in parenting approaches. The parent's justification about life skills might be valid, but so are the experiences that TV and games can offer in terms of creativity and social interaction.\n\nIn the end, while the parent's intentions are good, the strict restrictions without any flexibility might be limiting the children's experiences. The answer hinges on whether the parent's approach is harmful. The key is that the parent is making decisions based on their beliefs without considering the balance that's generally recommended for children's development. So, the parent might be in the wrong for being overly restrictive without a middle ground.\n"
