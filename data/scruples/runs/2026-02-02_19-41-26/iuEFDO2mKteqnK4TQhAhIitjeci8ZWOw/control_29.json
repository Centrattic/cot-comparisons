We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to have junk food, watch much TV, or play video games. The parent mentions that their children are happy, successful in school, and engaged in various activities. They also allow exceptions during special occasions and weekends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance between strictness and child well-being. The parent's reasoning includes avoiding addictive behaviors and focusing on educational value. They also mention that the kids are learning life skills and are well-mannered. However, some family and friends think they're too strict.\n\nI should think about child development guidelines. Moderate screen time and occasional treats are common, but the parent is allowing some flexibility (e.g., age-appropriate movies on weekends). The kids aren't deprived entirely but are restricted at home. The parent's approach might be more restrictive than average, but if the kids are thriving academically, socially, and emotionally, maybe it's not harmful. However, completely banning video games might limit creative or social opportunities, but the parent argues they see no educational value. \n\nAlso, the fact that the kids are top of their class and well-behaved suggests the parenting has positive outcomes. The parent's intent is to protect the kids from what they see as harmful influences. But some might argue that allowing some flexibility could teach self-regulation rather than strict control. However, the parent isn't preventing the kids from interacting with friends where they might have access. \n\nIn terms of the question, the parent is asking if they're in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are happy, successful, and the parent is providing alternative activities, there's no clear evidence of harm. The parent's approach is strict but not abusive. So the parent is likely not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
