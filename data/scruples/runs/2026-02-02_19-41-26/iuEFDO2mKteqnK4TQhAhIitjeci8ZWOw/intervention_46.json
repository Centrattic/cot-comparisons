We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have these things at home. The kids do other activities and are doing well in school and behavior-wise. Some family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent feels they're protecting the kids from addiction and harmful content.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that they don't allow junk food at home except for special occasions, which is a common approach. They also allow one movie a week. The video games are restricted because they see no educational value. The parent feels they're being strict but thinks it's for the kids' good. \n\nNow, the other side: friends and family say they're too strict. However, the kids are well-adjusted, happy, and successful. The parent is concerned about addiction and negative effects. The key issue here is whether the restrictions are overly harsh or if they're reasonable for the kids' development.\n\nI think the parent's approach is strict but not necessarily wrong. They provide alternatives (extracurriculars, learning life skills), which are beneficial. The kids are thriving academically and socially. The parent's concern about video games not being educational is valid, but there are educational games out there. However, the parent might be closing the door on potential benefits of gaming, like problem-solving or creativity. \n\nBut the parent also mentions the kids are happy and balanced. So maybe the restrictions are working for their family. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The parent is making decisions based on their values and what they believe is best. Since the kids are thriving and there's no harm mentioned, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that kids should have some freedoms to explore age-appropriate media. But given the context, the parent isn't preventing social interaction (since they can have junk food elsewhere) and provides other enriching activities. So probably the answer is B.\n"
