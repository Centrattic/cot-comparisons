We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The author mentions that their children are happy, involved in extracurricular activities, and do well in school. They also feel that some things like video games are not educational.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They believe that junk food is unhealthy and that TV and video games are addictive and harmful. They allow exceptions for special occasions and weekends. Their kids are well-adjusted, skilled, and successful. Other family and friends think they're too strict, but the parents feel they're preparing the kids for life.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that completely banning these things could be too restrictive. Kids sometimes need to experience these in moderation to learn self-control. Also, video games can have educational aspects, and TV can be a form of entertainment. However, the parents have a valid concern about health and content.\n\nThe key points are the children's well-being and the parents' intentions. The kids are happy and thriving, so maybe the restrictions are working for them. However, it's important to allow some autonomy as they grow older. The parents might need to consider flexibility as the children mature. But based on the current situation, the kids aren't suffering, and the parents have a rationale. So, is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but there's room for reflection. But since the question is a binary choice between A and B, and the user initially thought the answer is A (wrong), but I need to decide based on merits. Given that the kids are happy and the parents have good intentions, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if some level of these activities is necessary for normal childhood development, then A. Hmm. The line between discipline and being overly strict is thin. The author is doing what they believe is best, even if others disagree. If the kids are content and healthy, maybe the author isn't wrong. So, I'll go with B.\n"
