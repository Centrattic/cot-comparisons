We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and the kids are generally happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. The parent restricts junk food except for special occasions and friends' houses. No TV except age-appropriate weekend movies. No video games because they see no educational value.\n\nFirst, the parent's reasoning: they believe these restrictions prevent addiction and \"poison\" minds. They mention that the kids have other activities and learn life skills. The parent also notes that the kids are well-adjusted and successful, which suggests that the restrictions aren't causing obvious harm. However, family and friends think they're too strict.\n\nNow, considering child-rearing approaches, there's a spectrum from strict to permissive. The parent is on the stricter side but seems to have a rationale based on health and education. Allowing occasional exceptions (friends' houses, special occasions) shows flexibility. The child's happiness and success indicate the approach might be working for them. However, completely banning video games and TV without any educational content might be seen as limiting creative or social opportunities. But the parent allows movies on weekends, which can be educational or entertaining. The key here is that the parent is not entirely prohibiting all forms of entertainment but setting boundaries.\n\nThe parent might be in the right if the restrictions are based on the child's best interests and the kids are thriving. However, some might argue that denying access to common activities could affect social development, as kids often share similar experiences with peers. Yet, the parent mentions the kids have other engaging activities, which could mitigate that. The fact that the kids are top of their class and polite supports the effectiveness of the parent's methods.\n\nBut the parent's strictness might be seen as overbearing if it's causing undue stress or limiting the kids' ability to make choices later in life. However, the parent states the kids are generally happy, so maybe they're not being overly harsh. The line between discipline and control is thin. The parent's approach seems to prioritize long-term benefits over short-term pleasures, which is a common parenting strategy. So, considering all factors, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong, especially since the kids are happy and successful. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
