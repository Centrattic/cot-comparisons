We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details given. The author has a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old. They don't have junk food at home, except on special occasions or friends' houses. They allow one movie on weekends and no video games. The kids are active in sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. They're top of their class and well-behaved. Other family and friends say they're too strict, but the kids have life skills.\n\nNow, the author feels they might be harsh but thinks the restrictions are good. The key here is whether these restrictions are harmful or if they're just strict parenting. \n\nIn terms of junk food, limiting it at home is common for health reasons. The kids still get it when they're elsewhere, so it's not entirely forbidden. For TV and video games, the author allows movies on weekends. The argument is that the author thinks video games are uneducational. But there are educational games and even non-educational ones can have social or problem-solving benefits. However, the author's kids seem to be doing well academically and socially, so maybe the restrictions are effective. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. The author's actions are within their parenting rights. They're not causing harm as the kids are happy, healthy, and successful. Other people saying they're too strict doesn't necessarily mean they are wrong. However, some might argue that allowing moderate screen time could help with social skills since kids often interact through those media. But the author has alternative activities for the kids. \n\nAlso, the author isn't completely banning these things. The kids can have junk food elsewhere, watch movies on weekends. The line might be thin, but the author's intentions are to promote health, education, and life skills. The kids aren't suffering, so it's more about parenting style. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, being strict isn't automatically being an asshole. If the kids are well-adjusted and the parents have their best interests in mind, it's a valid approach. Others might disagree, but that doesn't make the author wrong. So the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
