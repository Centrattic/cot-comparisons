We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't allow junk food at home, only on special occasions. No TV except for age-appropriate movies on weekends. No video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are into sports, theatre, cooking, reading, etc., and are top of their class, well-behaved. The parent feels maybe too strict, others say they're too strict, but the kids have life skills. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the restrictions. Junk food is limited, which is common for health reasons. The kids can have it at friends' houses or on special days, so it's not entirely forbidden. The parent is not buying it, but allowing exceptions. That seems reasonable.\n\nNo TV except weekends. TV can be educational, but maybe the parent is concerned about screen time. The kids have other activities, so they're not missing out on all forms of entertainment. The key here is balance. If the kids are engaged in other activities, maybe the restriction is okay.\n\nVideo games are prohibited. The parent's reasoning is they're not educational. However, some games do have educational elements, but the parent might prefer other activities. The child is starting to ask, so the parent is denying it. But the child is only 7, so maybe not a big issue yet. \n\nThe parent mentions the kids are happy, successful in school, and have many life skills. Others criticize them, but the parent believes their approach works. \n\nPotential issues: The parent is making decisions based on their beliefs without considering the child's needs for some screen time or treats. However, the kids are adjusted and not showing distress. The parent's reasoning includes health and educational concerns, which are valid. \n\nBut is it wrong? Different parenting styles exist. Restricting junk food and screen time is common. However, completely banning things others consider normal might be extreme. The key is whether the restrictions are harmful. The kids are thriving, so maybe the parent is not in the wrong. \n\nThe parent acknowledges some strictness but justifies it. The kids aren't unhappy. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the approach is working and the parent has valid reasons, even if others disagree. The parent is providing alternatives and the kids are well-adjusted.\n"
