We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to have junk food, TV, or video games. I need to consider both sides here.\n\nFirst, the parent's reasoning: they want to avoid junk food because it's unhealthy, limit screen time to prevent addiction and promote other activities, and they don't see educational value in video games. Their kids are doing well academically, are involved in extracurriculars, and are described as polite and well-behaved. The parent also mentions that other family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids seem happy and have many other activities.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that kids need some freedom to explore and that strict rules could be limiting their social experiences. For example, if other kids are allowed to play video games, this child might feel left out when they're excluded from such activities. However, the parent allows exceptions for special occasions and friends' houses, so maybe the kids aren't entirely cut off.\n\nAlso, the parent's approach seems to be working in terms of the kids' academic and social development. The key points are that the children are happy, engaged in various activities, and are top of their classes. The parent is providing alternatives like cooking, sports, theatre, reading, etc., which are enriching.\n\nI should consider if there's any harm in the parent's strictness. The parent isn't preventing the kids from having fun, just redirecting their entertainment towards other activities. The concern about addiction and negative effects of media is valid for some kids, but the parent is making a choice based on their values.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, parenting styles vary. Some parents use time limits, others are more restrictive. As long as the kids' basic needs are met and they are safe, it's a matter of personal choice. The parent isn't neglecting their children; they're making active decisions for their upbringing.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether strict limits on certain activities make the parent wrong. Since the kids are thriving and the parent is providing other enriching options, it's not necessarily wrong. The parent's intentions are for the kids' well-being, and there's no indication of harm. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
