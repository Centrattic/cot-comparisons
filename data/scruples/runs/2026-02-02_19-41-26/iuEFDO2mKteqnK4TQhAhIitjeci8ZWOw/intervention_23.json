We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent explains that they do this to instill life skills, keep the kids active, and maintain their academic performance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent allows friends to have junk food on special occasions and limits screen time to age-appropriate movies once a week. The kids are happy, involved in activities, and top of their class. However, some family and friends think they're too strict.\n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, parenting styles vary. Some parents might believe that complete restriction is harmful, while others see it as protective. The key points are the kids' well-being. The parent mentions the kids are happy, which is a positive sign. They're engaged in extracurriculars and learning life skills. However, the parent's reasoning about addictive media and junk food's effects is a common concern.\n\nBut, some might argue that allowing some junk food and limited screen time is normal and helps kids develop moderation and self-control. The parent's approach could be seen as overly restrictive, especially if the children are missing out on social experiences where friends might have such items. Also, video games can have educational aspects, even if not all are educational, and the parent is denying the son that opportunity entirely.\n\nOn the flip side, the parent's goals (health, education, life skills) are valid. The kids' success and behavior suggest the approach works. However, the question is whether the parent is \"in the wrong.\" If the kids are thriving, maybe not. But if the restrictions are causing unnecessary deprivation or social issues later, maybe yes.\n\nThe parent's own feelings of being harsh and others calling them strict add nuance. It's a balance between protecting and enabling. Since the kids are happy and successful, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the approach is isolating them or causing future problems, they might be. But the question is about current actions. Given the info, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's close. Alternatively, A if the strictness is harming the kids. However, since the kids are okay, B seems more likely.\n"
