We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent in the given scenario is in the wrong. The parent doesn't allow their kids junk food, TV, or video games. The kids are well-behaved, top of their class, and involved in activities. The parent feels they're strict but thinks the restrictions are for the kids' good. Others say they're too strict, but the kids have life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. There's authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, etc. The parent here seems to be on the stricter side, but the kids are happy and successful. So maybe it's a balance. The parent is allowing some exceptions, like occasional junk food when at friends' houses. That shows flexibility. Also, the kids are engaged in other activities, which might compensate for the restrictions.\n\nBut is it wrong? Well, every parent has their own approach. The question is whether the restrictions are harmful. The parent's reasoning is that junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive. They mention that the kids are happy and well-adjusted, so maybe the restrictions aren't causing harm. However, some might argue that kids need some screen time for social reasons, as many peers have it. Also, video games can have educational aspects, but the parent is against them completely.\n\nThe parent is also considering others' opinions but sticking to their own beliefs. They feel they might be harsh but justify it. The kids aren't showing signs of distress, so maybe it's okay. But does that mean they're not in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the restrictions are considered excessive. There's no legal or ethical violation here, just parenting choices. Different people have different views, but the parent isn't harming the kids. So, the answer might be B (No), because the parent's choices are their prerogative as long as the kids are safe and well-cared for.\n"
