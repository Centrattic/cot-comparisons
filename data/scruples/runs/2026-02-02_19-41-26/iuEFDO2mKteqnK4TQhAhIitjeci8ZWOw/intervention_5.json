We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent who doesn't allow their kids to have junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The kids are 7 and 9, and the parent mentions that they have other activities like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, etc. The kids are doing well in school and are described as well-behaved.\n\nFirst, I need to think about what the boundaries are here. The parent is making choices about their children's diet and screen time. There's a common debate about whether kids should have some screen time or occasional junk food. The parent is strict but there's context\u2014like they allow it on special occasions and if they're at friends' houses. The parent also mentions that they're concerned about addiction and negative mental effects, which is a valid point for some parents.\n\nBut where's the line between being strict and being harmful? The kids seem happy and well-adjusted, which is a good sign. They have plenty of other enriching activities. The parent is also teaching life skills, which is a positive aspect. However, some might argue that completely banning all junk food and screen time could be too restrictive, especially since peers might have those things. If the kids are begging for it and it's a normal part of childhood, maybe a moderate approach is better. But the parent does allow movies on weekends, which is a compromise.\n\nI should also consider if the parent is being too controlling, which could affect the child's autonomy. However, the parent's reasoning seems to be about health and education, which are common parental concerns. The fact that the kids are doing well academically and socially might support the parent's approach. On the other hand, if the restrictions are causing the kids to feel deprived or different from their peers, that's a potential issue. But the parent mentions the kids are mostly fine with it, so maybe they aren't overly upset.\n\nAnother angle: cultural differences. Some families are more strict, others more lenient. There's no one-size-fits-all. The parent is making choices that work for their family. The friends and family saying they're too strict might not understand their reasoning. But as long as the kids are safe, healthy, and developing well, the parent is probably within their rights.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making decisions based on their values and what they believe is best for their children. The key factors are the children's well-being and development. Since the kids are happy, successful, and have a variety of activities, the approach seems valid. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
