We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The answer needs to be either A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9. They don't have junk food at home, only on special occasions. They allow a movie once a week, no TV otherwise, and no video games. The kids are involved in activities, top in school, and well-behaved. The parent feels they might be too strict but believes the restrictions are for the kids' benefit. Others think they're too strict, but the kids have life skills.\n\nNow, considering parenting styles. There's a balance between being strict and being overly controlling. The parent's approach seems to be about instilling healthy habits and life skills. The kids are doing well academically and socially. However, TV and video games can have educational aspects, but the parent dismisses video games as non-educational, which might be a point of contention. \n\nThe key factors here are: the kids are happy, successful, and well-rounded. The restrictions are not absolute\u2014there's flexibility on weekends and special events. The parent is conscious of their approach and feels some guilt, but the kids are thriving. \n\nOthers might argue that some screen time is normal and beneficial in moderation, but the parent's reasoning is about avoiding addiction and negative influences. The children's happiness and success suggest the approach is working for them. \n\nIn terms of parenting advice, there's no one-size-fits-all. If the kids are content and developing well, the parent isn't necessarily wrong. However, completely banning all forms of media might be seen as too strict by some. But since the parent allows exceptions and the kids are doing fine, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The method is working for their family, and the kids are well-adjusted. The parent's intention is to provide a balanced upbringing with necessary restrictions, which is a valid approach even if others disagree.\n"
