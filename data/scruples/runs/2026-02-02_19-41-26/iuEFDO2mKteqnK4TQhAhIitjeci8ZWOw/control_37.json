We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't allow junk food at home except for special occasions. They do let them watch a movie on weekends and don't allow video games. The kids are described as happy, involved in activities, top of their class, polite, and well-behaved. The parent feels they might be too strict, but family and friends say they are. The parent is wondering if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that junk food is addictive and poisons minds, video games aren't educational. They allow exceptions for friends' houses and special events, so there's some leniency. The kids are engaged in various activities and life skills, which suggests they have other forms of entertainment and learning. The kids are doing well academically and socially, which is a positive outcome.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are child welfare, parental authority, and balance. Parents have the right to set boundaries, but there's also the aspect of moderation. The parent is making decisions based on their beliefs about what's healthy, but they should also consider the children's development in terms of self-regulation. Allowing some screen time or occasional junk food could help kids learn to manage these things, rather than being completely restricted. However, the parent's approach has resulted in well-adjusted, happy children. \n\nOther family members and friends think they're too strict, but the parent's rationale is about protecting the kids from what they see as harmful influences. The fact that the children are thriving academically and socially might indicate that the approach is working. However, completely banning things might lead to issues later if the kids don't learn to handle these in moderation. Also, video games can have educational aspects depending on the type, so a blanket ban might be restrictive without justification.\n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, there's no legal or moral obligation to allow these things. As long as the children are safe, healthy, and their needs are met, the parent's approach is within their rights. The children's happiness and success suggest the approach isn't harmful. However, some might argue that allowing occasional screen time or treats can be part of a balanced childhood. \n\nThe parent might benefit from flexibility, but given the current situation where the kids are doing well, maybe it's not wrong. The answer would be B (No) because the parent is making decisions they believe are in their children's best interest, and the children are thriving. There's no evidence of harm, so they are not in the wrong.\n"
