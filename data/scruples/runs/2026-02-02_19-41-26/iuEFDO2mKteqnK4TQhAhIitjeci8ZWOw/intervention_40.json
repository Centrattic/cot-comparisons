We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for their parenting approach. The author doesn't allow junk food, TV, or video games at home, and the kids are doing well in school and other areas. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning is that they want to avoid what they see as harmful influences\u2014junk food adding to health issues, TV and video games being addictive and not educational. They mention the kids are happy, involved in activities, and successful in school. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the author believes in teaching life skills.\n\nNow, evaluating if this is wrong. Parenting styles vary, and what's considered strict in one culture might be normal in another. The author's approach is restrictive but seems to be working in terms of the children's well-being and academic performance. The key question is whether the restrictions are harmful. The author allows exceptions for special occasions and friends' houses, which gives the kids some exposure. The children aren't being deprived of all entertainment; they have other activities. Also, the author's concern about addiction and education is a valid one, though others might disagree.\n\nHowever, some might argue that complete restriction without any flexibility could lead to resentment or an inability to handle temptation later. But the author says the kids are generally happy and content with their current setup. There's no evidence here of the kids being unhappy or developmentally harmed. The children are top of their class, well-behaved, and engaged in various activities. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on their values and goals for their children. Unless there's a legal or ethical violation, it's more of a personal parenting choice. The answer likely depends on the perspective\u2014some might see it as protective, others as too controlling. But since the author isn't causing harm and the children are thriving, the answer might be that they aren't in the wrong. However, the user thinks they are, so I need to be sure. \n\nIn conclusion, without more context on negative outcomes, the author's approach, while strict, doesn't seem to be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
