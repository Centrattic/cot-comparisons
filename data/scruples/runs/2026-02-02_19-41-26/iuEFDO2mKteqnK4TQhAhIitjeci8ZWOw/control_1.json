We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have these things at home. The kids are happy, do lots of activities, are top of their class, and have good behavior. Other people think they're too strict, but the parent believes the restrictions are good for the kids' minds and life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. There's a balance between being strict and being too permissive. The parent is setting clear boundaries, which can be beneficial for discipline and focus. They mention that the kids are allowed some exceptions, like at friends' houses or special occasions, so it's not entirely forbidden. The kids seem to be thriving academically and socially, which is a positive outcome.\n\nHowever, completely banning things like video games or TV might limit the kids' opportunities to engage in common social activities. Video games can have educational aspects, like problem-solving, and TV can be a way to relax. But the parent argues against the educational value of video games, so maybe they're not interested in that aspect.\n\nThe parent also mentions that the kids have other activities, which is good. The key question is whether the restrictions are harmful. If the kids are happy and well-adjusted, maybe the parent is doing okay. But is it wrong to deny them things that other kids have? It depends on the reasoning. If the parent believes it's for the kids' long-term benefit, and the kids aren't showing signs of distress, perhaps it's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that kids should have some freedom to explore age-appropriate media.\n\nThere's also the aspect of addiction and content. The parent is concerned about addictive qualities and negative content, which is a valid concern. But as long as the restrictions are not overly harsh and the kids have other outlets, it might be justified. The parent is also teaching life skills, which is a positive. Other family members and friends think they're too strict, but the parent's reasoning is based on their values.\n\nIn the end, the answer would hinge on whether these restrictions are considered reasonable. Since the kids are happy and successful, and the parent has their own rationale, it's possible that they are not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
