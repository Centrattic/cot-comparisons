We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. They provided a detailed scenario where the parent is strict but the kids are top of their class, well-behaved, and involved in many activities. The parent feels they might be too harsh but also believes that junk food and video games are harmful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, the parent is setting boundaries that they believe are beneficial for the children's health and development. They mention the kids are happy, successful in school, and have various activities. The parent's reasoning about avoiding addictive and harmful content might be valid. On the other hand, some might argue that kids need some freedom to explore and that complete restriction could lead to issues, like feeling deprived or not learning to make healthy choices themselves.\n\nThe parent allows exceptions for special occasions and friends' houses, which shows they're not entirely rigid. They also provide alternatives like cooking, reading, and outdoor activities. The kids are thriving academically and socially. However, the parent is concerned about addiction and mind pollution, which might be based on personal beliefs rather than evidence. But the fact that the kids are well-adjusted suggests the approach is working for them.\n\nOther family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids are learning life skills. The parent's intentions seem to be for the children's benefit. In terms of societal norms, there's a spectrum of parenting styles. Some parents are more permissive, while others are stricter. The key factors here are the children's well-being. Since the kids are happy, successful, and have a balanced lifestyle with activities, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the restrictions are causing the kids to feel deprived or not learning to make their own choices, that could be a problem.\n\nHowever, the parent isn't entirely restrictive. They do allow movies on weekends and the kids aren't showing signs of distress. The decision to not allow video games is based on the parent's view that they're not educational, but there are educational games too. Still, the parent's primary concern is the children's development, and they seem to be achieving that. The children's success in school and society might support the parent's approach.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's room for debate, the parent's approach doesn't seem harmful as long as the children are thriving and the restrictions aren't causing undue stress. The parent is making choices that align with their values and seem to benefit the kids, so they might not be in the wrong. Answer B (No).\n"
