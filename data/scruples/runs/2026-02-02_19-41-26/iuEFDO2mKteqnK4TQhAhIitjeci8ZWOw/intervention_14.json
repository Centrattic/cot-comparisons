We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe parent has two kids, a 7-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl. They don't allow junk food in the house except for special occasions or when visiting friends. They also restrict TV to an age-appropriate movie on weekends and no video games because they see no educational value. The kids are involved in extracurricular activities, top of their class, well-behaved, and have life skills. Family and friends think they're too strict, but the parents believe they're protecting the kids from addictive and harmful content.\n\nThe parent is asking if they're the asshole for their strictness. The question is whether they are in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I should consider the parents' reasoning. They mention that the kids are happy, have many activities, and are successful in school. They also believe junk food is addictive and video games are uneducational. But others think they're too strict. \n\nI need to evaluate if their restrictions are harmful. Are there any red flags? Not allowing junk food entirely might be controversial. Some parents allow it in moderation, but the author's approach is zero junk food at home. However, the kids can have it at friends' places or special events. That seems reasonable as long as it's not over-restrictive or causing significant stress.\n\nTV and video games are another aspect. Allowing one movie a week is very limited, but maybe it's okay if the parents are concerned about screen time. The parent's reasoning about video games being uneducational might be valid, but some games can have educational elements, so denying all might be seen as too rigid. However, the parent is not forbidding all screen time entirely, just video games and limiting TV.\n\nThe kids are involved in many activities and have life skills, which is positive. Their success in school and good behavior suggest the approach is working in some ways. But is there a downside? Maybe the kids could benefit from some flexibility. For example, video games can improve problem-solving skills or hand-eye coordination. However, the parent's stance is that they see no educational value, so they might have their own research here.\n\nThe key points are whether the restrictions are harmful, if the children are being denied important experiences, or if the parents are overstepping. The fact that the kids are happy and successful suggests the restrictions aren't causing harm. The parent might be right in their approach if it aligns with their values and the kids' needs. However, some might argue that a little flexibility could be beneficial for the children's social development, especially if peers are allowed such activities. But since the kids can have junk food when visiting others, maybe they're not entirely deprived.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' intention. They mention feeling they might be harsh but also believe they're protecting the kids. Their concern about addiction and negative content is valid. However, completely banning certain activities might lead to future rebellion or a lack of understanding of moderation. But since the kids are still exposed to some media and have a rich environment, maybe it's balanced.\n\nIn terms of parenting styles, authoritative (setting boundaries but allowing some autonomy) is generally considered effective. If the parents are being authoritarian (strict without flexibility), that's less effective. However, the author allows exceptions (special occasions, movies), so it's not entirely authoritarian. The children's happiness and achievements suggest the approach works for now.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the parents' strictness might not be in the wrong, especially since their children are thriving. Others might disagree, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since there's no evidence of harm and the parents have their own rationale, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, some might argue that even if the kids are okay now, the approach could limit their experiences. But based on the information given, the parents seem to have a balanced approach with valid reasons.\n"
