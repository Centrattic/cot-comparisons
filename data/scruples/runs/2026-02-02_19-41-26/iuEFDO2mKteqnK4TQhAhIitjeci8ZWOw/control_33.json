We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent in the given scenario is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, who are doing well academically and are well-behaved. The parent allows some exceptions for special occasions and friends' houses but keeps a strict policy at home. They mention that the kids are involved in extracurricular activities and learn life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance between discipline and being too strict. The parent's reasoning is that they believe junk food is unhealthy, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. The kids are happy, involved in activities, and successful in school. However, friends and family think they're too strict. \n\nI remember that parenting styles vary, and there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Some parents might use a more permissive style, allowing kids to have some junk food and screen time in moderation. But others, like this parent, might be more restrictive for health and educational reasons. The key here is whether the parent's actions are harmful or not. The kids are happy and well-adjusted, so it's possible the restrictions are working for them.\n\nAlso, the parent is allowing alternatives like movies on weekends and other activities. The kids aren't completely isolated from these things, as they can have them at friends' places. That might be a middle ground. However, the parent is being strict about not allowing video games, which some might argue can have educational aspects, but the parent disagrees.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is wrong. Since there's no definitive right or wrong in parenting, but the kids are thriving under these rules, it's plausible the parent isn't in the wrong. Others might disagree, but given the context, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
