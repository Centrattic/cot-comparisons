We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on their parenting choices. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author has two kids, a 7-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter. They don't allow junk food at home, only on special occasions like visiting friends or Christmas. They don't let the kids watch TV except for an age-appropriate movie on weekends. Video games are also off-limits because the author thinks there's nothing educational about them. The kids are doing well in school, are top of their class, and are described as polite and well-behaved. They have a lot of extracurricular activities like sports, theater, cooking, reading, biking, and playing with the dog. The author is concerned they might be too strict but also thinks that junk food and video games are addictive and harmful. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the kids have more life skills than their peers. The author is asking if they're the a**hole for raising their kids this way.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author's restrictions are on junk food, TV, and video games. The children have access to other activities and are doing well academically and socially. The parents are making decisions based on their beliefs about what's good for the kids. They mention that the kids are happy most of the time, which is a positive sign. However, other family and friends think they're too strict.\n\nNow, the question is whether these restrictions are wrong. From a parenting perspective, it's common to set boundaries for children's health and development. Junk food in moderation is generally acceptable, but the author is avoiding it except for special occasions. This could be seen as healthy, but some might argue that occasional treats are important for a balanced diet and learning about moderation. TV and video games in moderation can have educational aspects, but the author is rejecting them entirely. However, the author does allow age-appropriate movies on weekends, which suggests some flexibility.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they want to avoid addiction and mind pollution, which are valid concerns for some parents. The fact that the kids are well-adjusted, successful in school, and engaged in activities might indicate that the restrictions are working. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering child development, some flexibility is important for children to learn self-regulation. For example, allowing occasional screen time might teach kids how to manage it themselves. But the author's approach is strict, which might not be harmful if the kids aren't deprived of other important experiences. The author also provides alternative activities, which is a positive aspect.\n\nThe key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are happy, well-behaved, and successful, it's likely that the author's approach isn't causing harm. However, some might argue that denying all forms of entertainment like video games could be too restrictive, but the author's reasoning about educational value is their own opinion. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, parenting styles vary. Some parents are strict, others more permissive. As long as the children's basic needs are met and they're not being neglected or abused, the author's approach isn't inherently wrong. The fact that the kids are thriving under this structure suggests that the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a balance between protecting and allowing children to experience a range of activities. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are making conscious decisions based on their values, and the children are doing well. While others might disagree, as long as the children aren't being harmed and are developing appropriately, the author's approach is valid.\n"
