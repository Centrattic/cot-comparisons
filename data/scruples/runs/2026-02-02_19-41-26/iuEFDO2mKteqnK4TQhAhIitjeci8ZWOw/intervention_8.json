We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have junk food at home, only allow TV on weekends for movies, and no video games. The kids are doing well academically and in extracurriculars, and family and friends say they're too strict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. On one hand, the parent is setting strict boundaries, which might be for the kids' health and development. They mention the kids are happy, well-behaved, and have many skills. On the other hand, some might argue that kids need some screen time and occasional treats for balance.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that junk food is unhealthy, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. They allow exceptions when visiting friends or on special occasions, which shows some flexibility. The kids aren't begging much, suggesting they're adjusting well. The parent also provides alternatives like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc., which are enriching activities.\n\nBut is it wrong to not allow these things? It's a common debate. Some experts say moderation is key, but others support strict limits, especially for young kids. The parent isn't completely banning all screen time or junk food entirely, just at home. The children are thriving academically and socially, which is a positive sign.\n\nThe parent feels conflicted but believes it's for the kids' betterment. Friends and family disagree, but the kids have life skills. However, there's a possibility that the restrictions could be too rigid, limiting the kids' ability to learn self-regulation or enjoy normal childhood experiences. But given the context, the parent's approach seems to be working for their children, and they're not isolated.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a range. Some families are more permissive, others strict. The key is whether the parent's methods are harmful. The answer might depend on cultural values and individual circumstances. Since the kids are happy and successful, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The question is whether \"wrong\" is being assessed based on personal parenting style or harm to children. Since there's no evidence of harm, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
