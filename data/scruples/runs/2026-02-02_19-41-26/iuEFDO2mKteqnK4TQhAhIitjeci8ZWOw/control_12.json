We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation presented. The parent mentions that they don't have junk food at home but allow it on special occasions. They also limit TV to age-appropriate movies on weekends and prohibit video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are involved in various activities and are doing well in school.\n\nNow, considering the kids' well-being. The parent states that the children are happy and successful, so maybe the restrictions aren't causing harm. But is there a point where being too strict could be negative? Some might argue that children need some freedom to explore and make their own choices, even if they're not perfect. However, the parent is providing alternatives like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc., which are all positive activities.\n\nThe parent's reasoning includes concerns about addiction and harmful effects of media. There's some debate about the impact of screen time and junk food, but the parent is making a choice based on their values. The children are aware of the rules and seem to accept them, which might indicate that the parent's approach is working for their family.\n\nOther family members and friends think they're too strict, but the kids are learning life skills. This could be a case of different parenting styles. There's no one-size-fits-all answer here. The key is whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are happy, well-adjusted, and successful, the parent might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that allowing some flexibility could be beneficial for the children's development of self-regulation.\n\nIn the end, the parent is making a judgment call based on their beliefs. Unless there's evidence of harm, it's a matter of personal values. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the approach is working for their children, and they have valid reasoning.\n"
