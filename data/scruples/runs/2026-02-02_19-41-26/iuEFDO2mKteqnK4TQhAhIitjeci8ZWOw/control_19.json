We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they are being too strict with their kids by not allowing junk food, TV, or video games. \n\nFirst, looking at the details: the kids are 7 and 9. The parents have zero junk food at home, but allow it on special occasions. They don't let them watch TV except for an age-appropriate movie on the weekend. Video games are off-limits because the parent thinks they're not educational. The kids are involved in lots of activities like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, outdoor play, and they're top of their class and well-behaved. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the kids have life skills.\n\nSo the main points are about parenting style. The parents are restrictive in certain areas but provide other enriching activities. The key question is whether these restrictions are harmful or not. The parent's reasoning is that junk food is bad, TV/video games are addictive, and they want to focus on education and life skills. The kids seem happy and successful, so maybe the restrictions aren't causing harm. \n\nBut some might argue that kids need some screen time and treats for normal social development, especially since they interact with peers who have these things. However, the parents are allowing exceptions for friends' houses and special events, which means the kids still get to experience those things without it being normalized at home. Also, the kids are engaged in a lot of activities, so they might not be missing out as much. \n\nThe parent is concerned about addiction and negative effects, which are valid concerns. The fact that the kids are happy and well-adjusted suggests the approach is working for them. While some might call them strict, strictness isn't inherently wrong if the child is thriving. The parent's intentions seem to be for the kids' benefit, and there's no evidence of neglect or abuse. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The parents are making choices they believe are good for their kids, and the kids are doing well. Unless there's harm, it's their parenting style, which is a personal choice.\n"
