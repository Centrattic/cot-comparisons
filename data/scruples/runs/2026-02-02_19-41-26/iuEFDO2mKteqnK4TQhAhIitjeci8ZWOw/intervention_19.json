We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent mentions that the kids are happy, involved in activities, and do well in school. Others have said they're too strict, but the parent believes the restrictions are for the kids' good.\n\nHmm. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The parent's reasoning is that they want to prevent addiction and promote life skills. They also note the kids have other activities and are top of their class. But some might argue that completely banning these things could be too strict. However, the kids are allowed exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions, which shows they're not entirely cut off. \n\nI need to consider if the restrictions are harmful. The parent's approach seems to be about discipline and health, and the kids are thriving academically and socially. The answer might depend on cultural norms or parenting styles. Some people advocate for balance, but the parent's kids seem well-adjusted. The parent's perspective is that the restrictions are protective. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. If the kids are happy and successful without these things, maybe it's not wrong. On the other hand, completely banning things like video games might be seen as too rigid. But since the parent allows some flexibility and the outcomes are positive, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). The key is whether the restrictions are harmful. The parent's reasoning and the kids' positive outcomes suggest they're not in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
