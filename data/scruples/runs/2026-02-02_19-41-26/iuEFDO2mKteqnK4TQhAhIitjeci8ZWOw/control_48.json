We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their kids to have junk food, TV, or video games. They have two kids, 7 and 9 years old. The parents mention that they allow some exceptions for friends' houses or special occasions but keep their home free of junk food. They do let the kids watch a movie on weekends and are strict about no video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are happy, involved in lots of activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. Some family and friends think they're too strict, but the parents believe the kids are learning life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's normal in parenting. Restricting junk food is common for health reasons, especially if the kids are eating well otherwise. Limiting screen time is also a common concern among parents to ensure kids aren't too sedentary or exposed to inappropriate content. Video games can be educational, but they can also be addictive. The parents here have a stance against them, but the kids seem to be thriving academically and socially.\n\nThe kids aren't being deprived entirely\u2014there are exceptions for special occasions and weekend movies. They have other activities to engage in, which suggests the parents are providing alternatives. The key point is whether the restrictions are harmful. The children are happy and successful, so maybe the approach is working. However, some might argue that completely banning things like video games could limit social opportunities if peers are playing them, but the parents mention the kids have other social activities.\n\nAlso, the parents are being consistent and have clear reasons. The question is whether they're being too strict. Since the kids are well-adjusted and the parents have considered alternatives, it's probably within reasonable parenting practices. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, as long as the children's basic needs and well-being are met, the parents aren't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
