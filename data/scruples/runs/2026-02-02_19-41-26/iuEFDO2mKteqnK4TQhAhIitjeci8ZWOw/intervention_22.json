We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent restricting their children from junk food, TV, and video games. The parent mentions that the kids are happy, involved in extracurriculars, and do well in school. They also say other family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent believes the restrictions are good for life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. There's a balance between being strict and being authoritarian. The parent is imposing rules without allowing much flexibility. The key points are that there's no junk food at home unless special occasions, no TV except for age-appropriate movies on weekends, and no video games because they find them uneducational. The parent feels sometimes too harsh but justifies it as protecting kids from addiction and bad influences.\n\nThe kids are doing well academically, socially, and in activities. They have life skills like cooking and sports. However, the parent is denying them common childhood activities that many kids engage in. The question is whether this is harmful or if the parent is overstepping.\n\nFrom a child development perspective, some screen time can be beneficial if balanced. Video games can have educational aspects, like problem-solving or strategy. Complete prohibition without any flexibility might lead to feelings of deprivation or rebellion, especially as the children grow older. The parent's reasoning about junk food is health-focused, which is valid, but the absence of any flexibility might be seen as too rigid.\n\nThe parent also mentions that the kids sometimes beg for junk food but are generally okay. That suggests the restrictions aren't causing significant distress. However, the parent's belief that the restrictions are protecting the kids from \"poisoning their minds\" could be an overreach, implying a lack of trust in the children's ability to handle some level of screen time or treats.\n\nOther family and friends think they're too strict, which might indicate that the parent's approach is more extreme compared to others. While having higher standards isn't inherently wrong, the complete absence of allowed activities without alternatives that the kids can enjoy might be limiting their social experiences. For example, if the son's friends play video games, not being allowed could make it harder for him to connect with peers.\n\nThe parent's justification about life skills is valid, but it's important to balance structure with allowing children to explore and make their own choices within limits. The parent might be underestimating the value of play and leisure activities that aren't directly educational but contribute to well-rounded development.\n\nIn summary, the parent has good intentions but the approach might be too strict without considering the children's social and emotional needs. The answer would depend on whether the restrictions are causing harm versus fostering good habits. Since the kids are doing well, but the parent is denying them common childhood activities that others have, it's a gray area. However, the lack of flexibility and the parent's dismissive view of video games and TV as purely negative might be where they're in the wrong.\n"
