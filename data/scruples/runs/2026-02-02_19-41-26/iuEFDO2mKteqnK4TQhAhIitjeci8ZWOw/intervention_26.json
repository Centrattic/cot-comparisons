We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The author's kids are 7 and 9 years old. They don't have junk food at home except on special occasions. They watch a movie once a week and have no video games. The kids are doing well in school, involved in activities, and are well-behaved. The author is worried they're being too strict but thinks the restrictions are for the kids' good.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider what's normal for parenting. Many parents do have some restrictions on junk food and screen time. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limits, like no more than 1-2 hours of screen time per day for kids over age 2. The author allows an age-appropriate movie once a week, which is less than that, so maybe that's within guidelines.\n\nJunk food restrictions are also common, especially if parents are focused on healthy eating. The kids still get to have it at friends' houses or on special days, so it's not completely banned. The author mentions that the kids sometimes beg but are generally okay with what they have. That suggests the kids aren't suffering from deprivation.\n\nThe video games part is a bit tricky. The author says they don't allow them because they see no educational value. But some video games can have educational aspects, especially for problem-solving or strategy. However, many games are just for entertainment. The author's son is asking to play, but the parents say no. Still, if the kids are engaged in sports, theatre, and learning life skills, maybe the author is balancing it with other activities.\n\nThe key point here is whether these restrictions are harmful. The kids are happy, doing well in school, and have a variety of activities. The parents are getting feedback that they're too strict, but others might just think they're being proactive. There's no evidence here that the kids are unhappy or underdeveloped because of these rules. The author is also considering the addictive nature of media and junk food, which is a valid concern for some parents.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making choices based on their parenting style, and the kids are thriving. Others might not agree with the strictness, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's all about different parenting approaches. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
