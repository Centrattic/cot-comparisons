We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have any junk food at home. They allow it on special occasions when visiting friends. They also only allow a weekend movie and no video games because they see no educational value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's reasoning. They mention that the kids are happy, involved in extracurriculars, and top of their class. Other people think they're too strict, but the parent believes the restrictions are for the kids' good. The parent feels conflicted but thinks the restrictions prevent addiction and mind pollution.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. The key factors here are the children's well-being. The parent's approach seems to focus on health, education, and life skills. However, completely banning TV, video games, and junk food could be seen as overly strict. Kids need some unstructured time and social activities, which these activities might provide. For example, playing video games can develop problem-solving skills, and watching TV can be a way to relax. Also, junk food in moderation isn't harmful, and the parent's complete ban might be too rigid.\n\nBut the parent does allow exceptions when visiting others, which is good for socialization. The kids are involved in other activities, so they're not left without entertainment. The parent's concern about addiction and mind pollution is valid, but the approach might be too restrictive. It's possible that a balanced approach, allowing some screen time or occasional junk food, could be beneficial without being harmful. However, the parent's methods don't seem to cause harm, as the kids are happy and successful. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many parents have varying degrees of restriction. The parent's approach is stricter but not necessarily harmful. The line between discipline and being too strict is subjective. Since the kids are thriving in other areas, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But others might argue that the restrictions could lead to issues with social interactions or a lack of understanding of moderation.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's approach might be too strict, but since the kids are well-adjusted and the parent has good intentions, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the kids are happy and successful, and the parent's reasoning is based on their beliefs about what's best, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But some might argue for A because of the strictness. But the key is the outcome: the kids are doing well, so the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
