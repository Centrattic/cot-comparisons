We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. Hmm. First, I need to consider the context. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't have junk food at home, only on special occasions. They allow a movie a week and no video games. The kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. The parent feels they might be too strict but thinks the media is addictive and harmful. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the kids have more life skills.\n\nSo, the parent is trying to protect their kids from what they see as negative influences. They're providing alternative activities like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, etc. The kids are doing well academically and socially. The question is whether the parent is wrong. \n\nOn one hand, completely restricting TV and video games might be seen as too strict. Some studies suggest that moderate screen time can be okay, especially if the content is appropriate. Also, video games can have educational or cognitive benefits, like problem-solving skills. Not allowing any might limit the kids' ability to engage in common social activities with peers. \n\nBut on the other hand, the parent is making conscious decisions based on their beliefs about addiction and mental health. The kids are happy, which is a key factor. They have a lot of other enriching activities. The parent is focused on life skills and education. The key here is balance. If the restrictions are leading to unhappiness or social isolation, that's a problem. But since the kids are happy and well-rounded, maybe it's okay. \n\nAlso, the parent is allowing for some flexibility (e.g., friends' houses, special occasions). That shows they're not entirely rigid. The fact that the kids are top of their class and well-behaved suggests that the approach is effective. However, there's a risk that as the kids get older, these restrictions might cause conflict or make them feel deprived. \n\nBut the question is whether the parent is in the wrong now. Since the kids are thriving and the parent's intentions are protective, maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the restrictions are harmful. The parent is providing alternatives and the kids seem content. So, perhaps the answer is B, not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no red flags. No mention of abuse or neglect. The parent's approach is restrictive but not abusive. So, B.\n"
