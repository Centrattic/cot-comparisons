We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The parent is restricting their kids from junk food, TV, and video games. They mention that the kids are happy, involved in activities, and top of their class. The parent feels sometimes they're being too harsh but believes the restrictions prevent addiction and bad influences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent allows junk food on special occasions and friends' houses, so it's not an absolute ban. They allow one movie a week. No video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are engaged in other activities like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. The parent's reasoning is about protecting the kids from harmful influences and fostering life skills.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between discipline and overstrictness. The parent's approach is strict but seems to have positive outcomes in terms of the kids' behavior and academic performance. However, other family and friends think they're too strict. The question is whether this strictness crosses into being wrong.\n\nIn terms of child development, some screen time and occasional treats are common and not inherently harmful. Video games can have educational aspects, but the parent's stance is that they're not educational. The parent's approach might be seen as controlling if it's depriving the kids of normal childhood experiences. However, the kids are happy and involved in other activities, which mitigates that concern.\n\nThe parent is also teaching life skills, which is a positive. The main issue is whether denying these items is harmful. Without evidence of harm, and considering the kids are thriving, it's a judgment call. In some cultures, strict parenting is accepted. However, modern approaches often emphasize balance, allowing kids some autonomy. The parent's reasoning about addiction and mind-poisoning might be alarmist, but they have their reasons.\n\nSo, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because the kids are well-adjusted and the restrictions are not causing harm. The answer would be B (No). However, some might argue that the parent is being overly strict, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the kids are happy and successful, the parent's approach works for them. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
