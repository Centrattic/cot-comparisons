We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't keep junk food at home but allow it on special occasions. They don't let them watch TV except for a movie on weekends and no video games because they think it's not educational. The kids are doing well in school and extracurriculars, and are described as well-behaved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. The parent is using a strict approach, focusing on education and life skills. They mention other family and friends think they're too strict, but their kids are successful in school and have good behavior. The parent also acknowledges feeling harsh but justifies it by saying junk food is addictive and video games are mind-poisoning.\n\nI should think about the balance between discipline and child development. Kids do need some form of entertainment and relaxation. Video games and TV aren't inherently bad; they can be educational or just fun. But the parent doesn't allow any screen time except for a movie once a week. The key here is whether this is excessive or if it's a reasonable boundary.\n\nThe children are top of their class and have good behavior, which suggests the approach is working in terms of academic and behavioral outcomes. However, it's important to consider the social aspect. If kids are not allowed to play video games, they might miss out on social activities with peers. But the parent says they don't have junk food at home and only allow it when visiting friends, which might mitigate that issue.\n\nAlso, the parent allows other activities like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. So the kids are engaged in various ways. The question is whether restricting these specific activities is harmful. Some might argue that allowing some flexibility could help kids learn self-control in moderation. However, the parent's approach seems to be about health and education, which are valid concerns.\n\nThe parent is concerned about addiction and negative content. That's a common worry, especially with media. But completely banning all screen time might be seen as overly restrictive. However, given the kids' success and the parent's reasoning, it's a matter of perspective. Are the parents wrong for having these rules, or are they making conscious decisions for their children's well-being?\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, parenting styles vary. Some cultures emphasize strict discipline, others more leniency. The parent's approach seems extreme to some, but if the kids are happy and thriving, maybe it's not wrong. The answer would depend on whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are happy and successful, the parent might not be in the wrong. However, the answer could also consider the importance of allowing children some autonomy and the potential negative effects of strict control. But since the parent is not causing harm and the kids are thriving, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
