We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on their parenting choices. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe parent has two kids, a 7-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl. They don't allow junk food at home, except for special occasions or when they visit friends. They don't let the kids watch TV except for an age-appropriate movie on weekends. Video games are also off-limits because they find them uneducational. The kids are involved in extracurriculars, do well in school, are polite, and have various activities they engage in. The parent feels their approach might be too strict, but others say they're too harsh. They're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider common parenting practices. Restricting junk food is a common strategy for health reasons. Many parents try to limit screen time for kids to encourage other activities. The parent here allows some exceptions, like movies on weekends, which might be a balanced approach. The kids are doing well academically and socially, which suggests the restrictions aren't negatively impacting them in those areas.\n\nHowever, there's a debate about the role of screen time. Some experts say moderate screen time is okay, especially for educational purposes. The parent's stance is that video games aren't educational, but there are games that can have educational value. On the other hand, the parent mentions the kids have other enriching activities, so maybe the lack of video games isn't a problem.\n\nThe parent is also concerned about addiction and negative effects of junk food and media. This is a valid concern, and many parents aim to protect their kids from these. The kids are happy and well-adjusted, which is a positive sign. Others in the family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent's approach seems to be working for their children.\n\nNow, considering if the parent is in the wrong. The question is whether their restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are thriving in terms of happiness, behavior, and academic performance, it's hard to argue that the parent is wrong. However, some might say that allowing a little more flexibility could help the kids develop balance and self-regulation. But the parent is consistent in their reasoning and the kids seem to accept it, so it's not causing immediate harm.\n\nAnother angle: the parent's justification is about preventing addiction and \"poisoning\" minds. That's their personal belief, but others might have different views. The answer depends on whether strictness without flexibility is inherently wrong. Since the kids are happy and have other activities, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
