We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent's reasoning is about avoiding addiction and mental \"poisoning,\" and they mention that the kids are happy, successful, and have many extracurricular activities. Others think they're too strict, but the parent believes the restrictions are for the kids' benefit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parent is making decisions based on their values and perceived benefits for their children's health and development. They're not allowing junk food at home, except for special occasions. They do allow movies on weekends, which provides some screen time. Video games are banned because they see no educational value. The kids are well-adjusted, academically successful, and engaged in activities.\n\nThe debate here is about whether the parent is being too strict. Some might argue that moderate screen time and occasional junk food can be part of a balanced life, teaching kids self-regulation. Others might support the parent's approach, emphasizing long-term benefits like healthy habits and avoiding media overuse.\n\nThe parent mentions that the kids are happy and have other enriching activities, which suggests that their needs for social interaction, creativity, and physical activity are being met. The fact that the children are top of their class and well-behaved could indicate that the restrictions aren't causing harm. However, the parent's belief that video games are purely addictive and lack educational value might be an oversimplification, as some games can have cognitive benefits or foster problem-solving skills.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is wrong. If the kids are thriving without these activities, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the restrictions are too rigid and prevent the kids from experiencing normal childhood activities, that could be problematic. The parent allows exceptions for friends' houses and special events, which shows they're not completely prohibiting it, just controlling the home environment.\n\nOthers in the family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent's methods seem to be working. In parenting, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. As long as the children are safe, healthy, and not being deprived of essential needs, the parent's approach might be justified. However, completely banning video games and TV could be seen as overly restrictive if it limits the kids' ability to interact with peers or develop time management skills.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent's approach might be considered strict but not necessarily wrong if it's leading to positive outcomes. However, there's a balance between protection and allowing children to experience and learn from a variety of activities. The fact that the children are happy and successful might mean the parent is not in the wrong. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
