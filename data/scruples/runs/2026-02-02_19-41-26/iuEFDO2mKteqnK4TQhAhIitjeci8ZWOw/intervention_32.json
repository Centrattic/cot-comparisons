We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing junk food, TV, and video games. The parent mentions that their kids are happy, do well in school, and learn life skills. They also allow exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning behind the parent's decisions. They believe junk food is unhealthy, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. They prioritize other activities like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. The children are top of their class and well-behaved, so the approach seems to be working in terms of academic and social success.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Some might argue that completely restricting these things could be too strict, especially if the children are missing out on social experiences, like playing video games with peers or watching TV with friends. On the other hand, the parent is providing alternative activities that are enriching. The kids don't seem to be unhappy, and the parent's reasoning is based on health and education concerns.\n\nOther family members and friends think they're too strict, but the parent's approach is working for their kids. It's important to note that there's no one-size-fits-all in parenting. What works for one family might not for another. The key factors here are the children's well-being, their ability to engage in other activities, and the fact that there's no indication of harm. So, considering all this, the parent might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
