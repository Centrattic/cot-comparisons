We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether not allowing junk food, TV, and video games is harsh or okay. \n\nFirst, the author's reasons: they want to avoid junk food's negative effects, limit TV and video games because they see them as addictive and not educational. They mention the kids are happy, involved in activities, and do well in school. The kids get some exceptions for special occasions and weekend movies. The author feels it's strict but believes it's for the kids' good.\n\nOther opinions say friends and family think they're too strict, but the kids have more life skills. The author is conflicted but stands by their choices. \n\nNow, considering child-rearing practices, there's no one-size-fits-all. Some parents set strict boundaries for health and development, others are more lenient. The key points here are that the kids are well-adjusted, successful, and the author's restrictions aren't causing harm. If the kids are happy, learning life skills, and thriving academically, maybe the restrictions are justified. \n\nHowever, some might argue that kids should have some freedom to explore media and snacks in moderation. But the author allows exceptions (friends' houses, special occasions) and provides alternatives. The kids aren't being denied all forms of entertainment; they have sports, theatre, cooking, etc. \n\nThe author's justification about avoiding addiction and mind pollution is a common concern, though subjective. The fact that the kids are top of their class and well-behaved suggests the approach is working for them. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's subjective. If the children are healthy, happy, and developing well, then it's a matter of personal parenting style. The answer might depend on cultural or community norms, but the question is whether the author is objectively wrong. Since there's no clear harm, and the parents are providing enriching activities, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
