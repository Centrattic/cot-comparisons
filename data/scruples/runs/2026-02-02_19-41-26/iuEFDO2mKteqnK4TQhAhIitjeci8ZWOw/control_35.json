We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether not allowing kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games is justified.\n\nFirst, the user mentions they have two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't keep junk food at home. The kids can have it on special occasions or at friends' houses. That seems reasonable, right? Moderation is key, and they're not completely banning it in all contexts. Then they don't let them watch TV except for age-appropriate movies on weekends. That might be strict, but the parents are allowing some screen time. As for video games, the dad says he finds nothing educational about them, so they're banned. The son wants to play, but they say no.\n\nThe parents also say the kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, polite, and have life skills. Other people think they're too strict, but the parents believe they're protecting the kids from addictions and bad influences. \n\nHmm. The key points here are the parents' motivations and the kids' well-being. The parents are making decisions based on what they think is best for the kids' health and education. They're not allowing junk food at home to avoid temptation, which is a common parenting choice. The screen time restrictions might be more controversial. While some might argue that video games can have educational aspects (like problem-solving in certain games), the parents are choosing to prioritize other activities. The fact that the kids are well-adjusted, happy, and successful in school suggests that their approach is working for now. However, completely banning video games might limit the kids' social interactions if peers are playing them, but the parents do allow movies, so maybe they're balancing it with other media.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, parenting styles vary. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The parents are making choices that align with their values and what they believe is best for their children's development. The kids aren't being neglected; they have a full schedule of activities and are thriving. While some might say they're too strict, the kids aren't suffering, and the parents are consistent. The author's reasoning about addiction and poison to the mind is a bit strong, but if that's their belief, it's their right as parents to enforce it. So probably, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
