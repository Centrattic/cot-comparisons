We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parent has two kids, 7 and 9. They don't keep junk food at home but allow it occasionally if they visit friends or have special events. For TV, they watch age-appropriate movies on weekends. Video games are off-limits because they see no educational value. The kids are involved in various activities like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, and learn life skills. The kids are top of their class and well-behaved. The parent feels maybe they're being too strict but also believes the restrictions protect the kids. Others say they're too strict, but the kids have more life skills.\n\nNow, considering child-rearing approaches. There's a balance between discipline and allowing some freedom. The parent is focusing on healthy habits and life skills, which are beneficial. However, some flexibility might be important for social development. For example, if friends are playing video games or watching TV, the kids might miss out on shared experiences. But the parent is allowing exceptions for special occasions, so maybe that's a middle ground.\n\nJunk food: Limiting it at home is common for health reasons. Allowing it in moderation when visiting others is reasonable. Video games can have educational aspects in some cases, but the parent's stance is that they see no educational value. However, some games do promote problem-solving or creativity. Still, the parent's concern about addiction is valid. TV and movies: allowing age-appropriate content weekly seems balanced.\n\nThe children are happy and successful, which suggests the approach is working for them. The parent is concerned about the kids' happiness but reports they're mostly okay. Other family members and friends think they're too strict, but the kids have more life skills. It's a trade-off between structure and flexibility.\n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong, it's subjective. Different parenting styles exist. If the kids are well-adjusted and not being deprived of social interactions, maybe the parent isn't wrong. But if the restrictions are causing social issues or lack of exposure to common childhood activities, there might be concerns. However, the parent includes other enriching activities, so maybe it's not harmful. The key is that the kids are happy and developing well. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their approach is working for the children's development, even if others disagree.\n"
