We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, a 7-year-old son and a 9-year-old girl. They don't keep junk food at home but allow it on special occasions. No TV except age-appropriate weekend movies. No video games because they see no educational value. The kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the kids have life skills. The parent is questioning if they're being too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent is wrong (A) or not (B). The key factors here are the children's well-being, their happiness, and the parent's reasoning. The parent cites that they restrict these things because they believe junk food is bad, TV/video games are addictive and harmful. They mention that the kids are involved in other activities and are successful academically and socially. The kids aren't unhappy, which is important. \n\nSome might argue that complete restriction could limit the children's exposure to media and technology, which are part of modern life. However, the parent allows exceptions for friends' houses and special events, which gives the kids some experience without overwhelming them. The parent's rationale is about protecting the children's health and minds, which is a common parental concern.\n\nThe children's happiness and success suggest that the approach is working. The parent isn't denying them all entertainment; they have other activities. The parent's strictness might be seen as excessive by some, but the outcome is positive. Legal standards don't typically interfere with parenting choices unless there's harm. Since the kids are healthy, well-adjusted, and thriving, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B.\n"
