We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have junk food at home except on special occasions. They allow age-appropriate movies on weekends and no video games because they think they aren't educational. The kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for both sides. The parent might be seen as strict, but they have good intentions. They want to avoid what they see as harmful influences and focus on life skills. The kids are doing well academically and socially, which suggests the approach can't be all bad. On the other hand, completely banning things like TV or video games might be too restrictive. Kids do consume media, and moderate use can have educational value or just be a way to unwind. Also, occasional junk food is normal for children, and entirely banning it could lead to a negative relationship with food or make them feel deprived.\n\nBut the parent allows exceptions when the kids are with friends or on special occasions, so it's not entirely forbidden. The key points here are the parent's reasoning and the kids' well-being. Are they being too strict, or is it reasonable? The parent mentions that other family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids are thriving. However, the parent's concern about addiction and mind pollution might be overblown. Video games can have educational aspects, and TV shows can be educational or culturally relevant. The parent's approach might be based on personal beliefs rather than evidence.\n\nIn terms of child development, some exposure to media is normal and can teach kids how to navigate the world. Denying all access might make them curious or rebellious when they're older. The parent's decision to not allow any video games could be seen as dismissing the potential benefits, like problem-solving skills or hand-eye coordination. But the parent does allow other activities like sports and theater, which are beneficial.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The author's stance is that the parent is in the wrong (A), but I need to analyze. The parent's approach is strict but not abusive. They provide alternatives and the kids are happy. However, completely banning certain things without allowing moderate use could be seen as overly controlling. It's possible that the parent's methods are effective, but there's a risk of being too rigid. The answer might depend on cultural norms and individual values. Since the kids are doing well, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But if the parent is causing unnecessary deprivation, then maybe they are. The user thinks the parent is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a philosophy that works for their kids, who are well-adjusted and successful. However, there's room for flexibility. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if the restrictions are harmful. Since there's no evidence of harm and the kids are thriving, the answer is likely B. But some might argue that it's still too strict. However, the parent's approach is their choice as long as the kids are not harmed. So final answer B.\n"
