We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't allow junk food at home, except on special occasions. They don't allow TV except for a weekend movie. No video games because they see no educational value. The kids are active, involved in extracurriculars, top of their class, polite, and well-behaved. The parent feels maybe they're being too strict, but others say they're too strict. The question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parent's reasoning and the outcomes. The parent's rationale is about health and education, avoiding addictions and negative influences. They mention that other family and friends think they're too strict. However, the kids are thriving academically, socially, and in activities. The parent is concerned about the potential harm of junk food, TV, and video games, but the kids are content and well-adjusted.\n\nIn terms of whether they're in the wrong, it's a bit of a subjective area. Parenting styles vary, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The parent's approach seems to be working for the kids' current well-being, but there's also the consideration of allowing kids to experience a balanced range of activities. For example, video games can have educational aspects (problem-solving, strategic thinking) and social elements. TV and movies can be educational or provide downtime. However, the parent is allowing exceptions (special occasions, weekend movies), which suggests some flexibility.\n\nThe parent might be oversteering towards restriction, but as long as the kids are happy, healthy, and developing well, it's not necessarily \"wrong.\" However, completely banning things that are common in many households might limit the kids' ability to make informed choices later. But the parent seems to have good intentions and the kids aren't suffering. \n\nIn terms of ethical or moral wrongness, unless the restrictions are causing harm or taking away fundamental rights, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The parent is making choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their children. Other parents might disagree, but that doesn't make the approach inherently wrong. The fact that the kids are top of their class and well-behaved suggests the approach is effective. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
