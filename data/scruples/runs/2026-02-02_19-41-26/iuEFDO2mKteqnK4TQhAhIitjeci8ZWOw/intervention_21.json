We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author has two kids and doesn't allow them to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games except on special occasions or weekends. They mention that the kids are happy, involved in activities, and do well in school. Some family and friends think they're too strict, but the parents believe they're teaching life skills.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to weigh the arguments. On one hand, the kids are well-adjusted, successful, and the parents have their reasons. But on the other, the restrictions might be too strict. However, the kids don't seem to be suffering; they have other activities. The parents' reasoning about junk food and video games being harmful could be valid. Also, the kids have age-appropriate movies on weekends, so there's some flexibility.\n\nI think the key points are that the children are thriving, the parents have clear reasons, and the kids are allowed exceptions. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But wait, is there a balance in parenting? Maybe some would argue that not allowing any junk food or video games is too much. However, the parents are also providing alternatives and the kids are happy. It's a tough call. But given that the kids are doing well and the parents are consistent, I might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
