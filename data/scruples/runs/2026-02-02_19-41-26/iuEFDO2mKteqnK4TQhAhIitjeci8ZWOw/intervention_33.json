We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on their parenting choices. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe parent has two kids, a 7-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl. They don't allow junk food at home except for special occasions. The kids sometimes get it when visiting friends or on holidays. Also, they don't let the kids watch TV except a movie on weekends. Video games are off-limits because the parent thinks they're not educational. The kids are involved in various activities like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, outdoor play, etc. They're top of their class, well-behaved, and have life skills. The parent feels strict but thinks the media is harmful. Others say they're too strict, but the kids are doing well academically and socially.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parent's reasoning is about avoiding junk food's negative effects and limiting screen time to prevent addiction and ensure educational value. The kids are happy, engaged, and successful. Others criticize the strictness, but the parent's approach seems to work for the kids' development.\n\nI should consider child development guidelines. Moderate screen time is often recommended, but some screen time can be educational. Junk food in moderation is okay, but the parent is avoiding it at home, which can prevent overconsumption. The kids are getting other enriching activities. The parent is not allowing video games, which some might argue can have educational aspects, but others might say the parent's stance is valid. The key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. The kids are thriving, so maybe the parent is not in the wrong. However, completely banning things might be too strict. But the parent allows exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions, so it's not entirely prohibition. The answer might hinge on whether the restrictions are reasonable and whether the kids are getting balanced alternatives. Since the kids are well-adjusted and successful, it's possible the parent is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
