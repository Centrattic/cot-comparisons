We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The parents are keeping junk food out of the house, allowing it only on special occasions. They don't let the kids watch TV except for one movie a week. Video games are banned because the parent thinks they're not educational. The kids are doing well in school, are well-behaved, and have many extracurricular activities. Some people think they're too strict, but the kids seem happy and have life skills.\n\nThe parent feels they might be harsh but believes junk food and media are harmful. Other family and friends disagree, but the kids are doing well academically and socially. The parent is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to weigh the parent's approach. Are these restrictions harmful? The kids are not being deprived of basic needs. They have access to other activities and are thriving. The parent's reasoning is about health and education, which are valid concerns. However, some might argue that complete restriction without flexibility could impact the kids' social experiences or autonomy.\n\nBut the kids are happy, doing well, and have a balanced life with other activities. The parent is not using punishment but clear rules. The key here is whether the restrictions are unreasonable. Since the kids have alternatives and are not missing out on essential social interactions, the parent's approach might be seen as a personal choice rather than wrong. However, others might say that allowing some screen time or junk food in moderation could be beneficial for balance and socialization.\n\nIn the AITA format, the community often considers the well-being of the children. Here, the children are thriving, so the parent's strict rules might be justified. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the children are healthy, happy, and successful. The parent's intentions are for their children's health and education, even if others disagree. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
