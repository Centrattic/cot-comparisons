We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent mentions that their kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. They also allow exceptions for friends and special occasions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child-rearing practices. Some parents believe in strict limits, others are more lenient. The parent's reasoning is about avoiding addiction and mind-poisoning, which is a common concern. The kids are engaged in other activities, which suggests the parent isn't depriving them entirely of entertainment. \n\nThe key points here are the kids' well-being. The parent says they're happy and successful. If the kids are adjusting well and the restrictions aren't causing harm, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. However, some might argue that occasional screen time or treats are normal and beneficial for kids in moderation. The parent's stance is strict, but if it's agreed upon by both parents and the kids aren't harmed, it's a personal choice. \n\nAlso, the parent is reflecting on being \"harsh,\" which shows they care about their kids' feelings. Other family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids have life skills. The main question is whether the restrictions cross into harmful territory. Since the kids are thriving and the parent's approach seems consistent, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if there's a lack of flexibility or consideration for child development needs, maybe A. But the kids aren't showing distress, so B is more likely.\n"
