We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their kids to have junk food, watch TV, or play video games. They mention that the kids are happy, do well in school, and have many positive activities. The question is whether their restrictions are too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different parenting styles. The parents are enforcing strict rules, which they justify because they see junk food and video games as addictive and harmful. They allow exceptions for special occasions or when at friends' houses. The kids are doing well academically and socially, which suggests the approach might be effective. \n\nHowever, the parents are facing criticism from family and friends. The key debate here is about balance. While the parents have good intentions, some might argue that children need some freedom to explore age-appropriate media and make their own choices. Denying all access to these things could be seen as overly restrictive, even if the parents' reasoning is sound. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are providing alternative activities that are educational and beneficial. The children are learning life skills, participating in sports and theater, and have good behavior. This might counterbalance the restrictions. \n\nBut the question is about whether the parents are in the wrong. The line between protection and overprotection can be thin. Allowing some flexibility, like limited screen time or occasional treats, might help the kids develop self-regulation skills. The parents' stance that video games have nothing educational is debatable, as some games can have problem-solving elements. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parents have valid reasons and their kids are thriving in other areas, the complete ban on certain activities might be too strict. It could hinder the kids' ability to make decisions and enjoy typical childhood activities in moderation. So, the parents might be in the wrong not because their rules are bad, but because they lack any flexibility and alternatives that could offer a balanced approach.\n"
