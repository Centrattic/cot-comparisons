We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who doesn't allow their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent mentions that the kids are happy, do extracurricular activities, and are doing well in school. Others think they're too strict, but the parent believes these restrictions are for the kids' good.\n\nFirst, I need to consider parenting styles. There's no one-size-fits-all approach. Some parents might allow more screen time or junk food, but this parent has their own reasons. The key points here are the children's well-being and development. The parent says the kids are happy, which is a positive sign. They're engaged in other activities like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, etc. So, the kids aren't deprived of all entertainment; they have other outlets.\n\nThe parent's reasoning is that junk food is unhealthy, TV and video games aren't educational and could be addictive. They also mention that the kids can have junk food at friends' houses or on special occasions, so it's not completely forbidden. The children are in top of their class and well-behaved. That suggests the parenting approach is working in terms of academic and social development.\n\nHowever, some might argue that complete restrictions could be too harsh. For example, allowing some age-appropriate video games can have educational benefits, like problem-solving skills. Also, TV and video games can be a way for kids to relax and socialize with peers. But the parent is allowing movies on weekends, which gives some flexibility.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The answer depends on context. If the children are healthy, happy, and developing well, maybe the parent isn't wrong. But if the restrictions are causing harm, then maybe. The parent mentions feeling harsh, but the children seem to be thriving. Other family members think they're too strict, but that's subjective. The parent's approach is strict, but the outcomes are positive. So, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, there's a balance. If the kids are missing out on normal childhood experiences, that could be an issue. But the parent has provided alternatives. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the information, the parent's methods seem to be working for their kids. So, answer B.\n"
