We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're too strict by not allowing junk food, TV, or video games for their kids.\n\nFirst, looking at the details: the kids are 7 and 9. The parents don't have junk food at home but allow it on special occasions. They do allow a movie on weekends and the son is asking for video games, which they've denied. The kids are described as happy, involved in activities, top of their class, polite. The parents' reasoning is that they don't see educational value in video games and think the media is addictive and harmful. Other family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids have life skills.\n\nHmm. So the parents are making choices based on their beliefs about what's best for their children. The key here is whether those choices are harmful. The kids are happy and successful in school and social skills. The parents are providing alternatives like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, etc., which are all positive activities. \n\nThe main concerns might be about the children's autonomy and potential social challenges when they interact with peers who have different habits. However, the kids are allowed some exceptions when they visit friends or on special days, so they're not completely cut off. Also, the parents are not preventing them from having fun in other ways. \n\nThe question is if this is \"wrong.\" From a parenting perspective, there's a balance between setting boundaries and being restrictive. The parents are prioritizing health, education, and life skills. While some might argue that video games and TV can have educational aspects or be a form of relaxation, the parents have made a judgment call. Since the children are thriving in other areas and are content, it's hard to say the parents are in the wrong. Others might think they could be more lenient, but that's subjective. The fact that the kids are well-adjusted and successful suggests the approach is working for them. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
