We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have any junk food at home. They do have some exceptions for friends' houses or special occasions. They allow movies on weekends and no video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are happy, involved in activities, and top of their class. Family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent believes the kids have more life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent's reasoning is that junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive and poison minds. They provide alternatives like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, etc. The kids seem well-adjusted, successful, and well-behaved. \n\nOn one hand, some might argue that completely cutting off these things could be too restrictive, especially since other children have access to them. The parent is making a choice based on their beliefs, but does that make them wrong? On the other hand, the kids are thriving academically and socially, and have other enriching activities. The parent's approach is strict, but it's their decision as long as the kids are not harmed. \n\nI should also think about the parent's intent. They mention feeling harsh but believe they're protecting the kids. The kids are allowed some flexibility (movies on weekends, exceptions for friends' houses). It's important to note that the children aren't deprived of all entertainment\u2014there are alternatives. \n\nIn terms of parenting styles, there's a spectrum from permissive to authoritarian. The parent seems to be on a stricter end, but the outcomes (happy, successful kids) are positive. The question is whether being strict is inherently wrong. If the kids are not harmed and are thriving, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that kids should have some freedom to explore age-appropriate media, and that total restriction could lead to rebellion as they grow older. But since the kids are in the target age and the parent is allowing movies and other activities, maybe it's balanced. \n\nAlso, the parent mentions that the kids don't really beg for junk food except occasionally. They seem content with their current diet. The educational value of video games is debatable, but the parent's stance is that they're not educational, which is their opinion. \n\nIn conclusion, while the parenting style is strict, the children are well-cared for, and the parent's decisions are based on their beliefs. Unless there's harm or neglect, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
