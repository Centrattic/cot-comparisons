We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether they're being too strict with their kids by not allowing junk food, TV, and video games. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the story. The author has two kids, 7 and 9. They don't have junk food at home except on special occasions. They don't allow TV except for age-appropriate movies on weekends. Video games are off-limits because the parent thinks they're not educational. The kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. Family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent believes the restrictions are for the kids' good.\n\nSo, is the parent wrong? Well, parenting styles vary. Some people believe in strict rules for healthier habits and education, while others think kids should have some freedom. The author's reasoning is that these activities are addictive and harmful. The kids are thriving academically and socially, so maybe the restrictions aren't the issue. However, completely banning things like video games might limit social opportunities since many kids play them. Also, the parent mentions the kids sometimes beg for junk food but are okay with their meals, which shows they're not overly unhappy. \n\nThe parent allows exceptions (friends' houses, special occasions), so it's not an absolute ban. They also provide alternatives like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. The kids are well-rounded. But maybe the parent is oversteering by not allowing any screen time or junk food. However, the kids are content, so it's not clear they're being harmed. \n\nLegally, unless the child is in danger, it's up to the parents to decide. The question is more about social norms. If other parents think it's too strict, but the kids are happy and successful, it's debatable. The parent's stance is that they're protecting the kids from what they see as negative influences. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at the kids' well-being. Since the kids are happy, well-adjusted, and doing well, the parent might not be in the wrong. However, completely denying access to common activities could have social drawbacks. But the parent is providing other enriching activities. \n\nSo, I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong. Their approach is strict but seems to work for the kids. The answer would be B (No).\n"
