We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong regarding their parenting choices. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't allow junk food at home, only on special occasions when visiting friends or family. They allow one age-appropriate movie a week and no video games because they see no educational value. The kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. Some family and friends think they're too strict, but the parent feels it's for the kids' benefit.\n\nThe parent is questioning if they're being too harsh. They mention concerns about addiction and negative effects of junk food, TV, and video games. The kids are engaged in other activities like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. So the parent's reasoning is to protect the kids from what they see as harmful influences and promote life skills.\n\nNow, I need to decide if the parent is in the wrong. From a general parenting perspective, it's common for parents to set boundaries on media and diet for children. The restrictions here seem reasonable: occasional junk food, limited TV time, and no video games. The key factors are the kids' well-being, their happiness, academic success, and social behavior. The parent is providing alternatives like extracurricular activities and life skills, which are positive.\n\nHowever, some might argue that complete bans can be too strict, possibly leading to rebellion later. But the parent is allowing exceptions for special occasions and the kids are content. Also, the parent's reasoning about avoiding addiction and negative influences is a valid concern. Since the children are thriving in other areas and are happy, the restrictions don't seem harmful. Therefore, the parent is likely not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
