We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong regarding their parenting choices. The parent has strict rules about no junk food, no TV, and no video games at home. The kids are allowed to have junk food on special occasions or when visiting friends. They also engage in various activities and are doing well academically and socially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parent's reasoning is that junk food is addictive and bad for health, TV and video games are not educational and could poison the mind. They mention their kids are happy, involved in extracurriculars, and top of their class. They're getting criticism from others but believe their approach is better for the children's development.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Parenting styles vary, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. However, the parent's approach seems to be focused on instilling healthy habits and life skills. The kids are not being denied all forms of entertainment; they have movies on weekends and various activities. The restrictions are clear, but there's flexibility during special times. The children are thriving academically and socially, which is a positive outcome.\n\nCriticism from family and friends is mentioned, but the parent's stance is that their approach is working. The children aren't being physically harmed, and their needs for social interaction and entertainment are being met through other means. However, some might argue that complete bans on TV and video games could limit social opportunities if peers are into those activities. But the parent allows movies on weekends, which might balance that.\n\nThe key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the kids are happy, well-adjusted, and successful, it's hard to argue the parent is wrong. The parent is making conscious choices based on their values and what they believe is best for their children. There's no indication of neglect or abuse. Therefore, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
