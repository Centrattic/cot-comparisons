We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't allow junk food at home, except for special occasions or when visiting friends. No TV except for weekend movies. No video games because they think it's not educational. The kids are top of their class, well-behaved, and involved in activities like sports and theater. The parent feels maybe they're being too strict but argues that these restrictions prevent addiction and bad influences. Friends and family say they're too strict, but the kids have good life skills.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is wrong (A) or not (B). Let me break it down. The parent's reasoning is about protecting the kids from junk food's negative effects, limiting screen time, and avoiding video games they see as harmful. The kids are happy, successful, and well-adjusted. Others criticize the strictness, but the parent sees value in their approach.\n\nI need to consider child-rearing philosophies. Some parents believe in strict limits for health and education, others think kids need some freedom. The key points here are that the kids are thriving academically and socially, and the restrictions are not causing harm as far as we can tell. The parent is providing alternatives like cooking, sports, etc., which suggests they're not depriving the kids entirely.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) situations, the community often looks at whether the actions are harmful or unnecessarily strict. Here, the parent isn't causing harm; they're making choices that lead to positive outcomes. The criticism from others might be valid, but the parent's approach seems to be working. The line between strict and harmful isn't crossed here. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
