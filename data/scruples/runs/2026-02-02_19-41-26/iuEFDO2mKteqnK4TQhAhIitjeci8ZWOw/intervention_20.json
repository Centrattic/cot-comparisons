We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent mentions that the kids are top of their class, well-behaved, and engaged in various activities. They also say the kids are happy most of the time. But other family and friends think they're too strict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning behind the parent's decisions. They believe junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive and poison minds. They allow exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions, so it's not a complete ban. The kids have other activities like sports, theater, cooking, reading, etc. The parent also mentions the kids have life skills and are doing well academically and socially.\n\nNow, is the parent in the wrong? From a legal standpoint, parents have the right to set boundaries. But from a child development perspective, some say that moderate screen time and occasional junk food can be okay. However, the parent's approach seems to prioritize health, education, and life skills, which are positive. The kids are still getting social interaction through friends and extracurriculars. The parent isn't keeping the kids in isolation; they're allowed movies on weekends and can interact with family who might have different rules.\n\nBut maybe the parent is being too strict. The key here is balance. If the kids are allowed to have some flexibility and are happy, maybe it's okay. However, the parent's reasoning about video games being non-educational might be short-sighted, as some games can enhance problem-solving skills. Also, complete restriction might lead to rebellion later, but the kids are currently content.\n\nThe parent's answer might be \"B\" not in the wrong, as they're making choices that seem to work for their family. The kids are thriving, and the parent is providing alternatives. While others criticize them, the outcome for the children seems positive. However, there's a risk of over-restriction, but the context provided suggests it's not harmful.\n"
