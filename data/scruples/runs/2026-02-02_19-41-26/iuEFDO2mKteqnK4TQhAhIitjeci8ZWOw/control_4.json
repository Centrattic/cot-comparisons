We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't have junk food at home, only on special occasions. No TV except an age-appropriate movie on weekends. No video games because they think it's not educational. The kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, well-behaved. The parent feels maybe they're being too strict but also worried about addiction and negative effects. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the kids have life skills.\n\nHmm. So I need to decide if the parent is wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. The parent is making choices about media and food. They mention that the kids are happy and doing well in school, which is a positive. They have other activities to engage in. But is this overstepping? Well, parents do have the right to set boundaries, but there's a balance. \n\nJunk food: having it only on special occasions seems reasonable. Not having it at home is a common approach to promote healthy habits. TV and video games: allowing some TV on weekends and no video games. The parent's reasoning is about addiction and lack of educational value. But kids do need some downtime. The fact that the kids are begging for these things might indicate they want some screen time, but the parent is denying it. However, the kids are still happy. \n\nThe parent also mentions that other family members and friends think they're too strict. But others might have different parenting styles. The kids' well-being seems to be okay\u2014they're successful and well-behaved. So the parent's approach might be harsher than average, but isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether the restrictions are harmful. If the kids are getting enough social interaction, physical activity, and other enriching activities, maybe the parent is not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the parent is listening to the kids' requests but setting firm boundaries. The question is about whether it's \"in the wrong.\" Since there's no harm done, and the kids are thriving, it's more about differing parenting philosophies. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The parent has the right to make those decisions unless there's evidence of harm, which there isn't mentioned here.\n"
