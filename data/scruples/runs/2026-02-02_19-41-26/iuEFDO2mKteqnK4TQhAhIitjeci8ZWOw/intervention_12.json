We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author has two kids and restricts them from junk food, TV, and video games. They mention that the kids are happy, involved in extracurriculars, and top of their class. The author feels they might be too strict, but others say they are way too strict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning is that junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. They allow exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions. The kids are engaged in other activities and seem well-adjusted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From a parenting perspective, there's a balance between setting boundaries and allowing some flexibility. Restricting completely might be seen as overly strict, especially since the author acknowledges that the kids sometimes beg for it. However, the kids are thriving academically and socially, which suggests the approach works for them.\n\nBut the author is concerned because others say they're too strict. The key here is whether the restrictions are harmful. If the kids are happy and developing well, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, completely banning certain activities might deprive them of learning self-regulation, which is a life skill. Also, some video games can have educational aspects, and not allowing them at all might be too rigid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is providing alternative activities that teach life skills, which is beneficial. The kids aren't isolated and have social interactions when visiting friends. The author might be protecting them from potential negative effects of media and junk food, which is a common concern among parents.\n\nIn terms of AITA, it's a judgment call. The author's approach is strict but seems to have positive outcomes. However, the rigidity could be problematic if it causes stress or if the kids feel deprived. Since the kids are happy and successful, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the restrictions are causing hidden issues, maybe they are. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate independently.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the children are well-adjusted and the author has valid concerns about health and media. The strictness isn't causing harm as per the description.\n"
