We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The parent has two kids, a 7-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl. They don't have junk food at home, only on special occasions. No TV except an age-appropriate movie on weekends. No video games because they find them uneducational. The kids are involved in extracurricular activities, top of their class, well-behaved, and learn life skills. The parent is questioning if they're being too strict, but others say they are.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the parent's approach is harmful or if it's just a strict but reasonable parenting style. The key points are the restrictions and the kids' well-being. The parent mentions the kids are happy and successful, which is a positive sign. They have other activities to engage in, like sports, theatre, cooking, reading, etc. That suggests the kids are not being deprived of all entertainment or social interaction.\n\nJunk food restrictions are common for health reasons. Allowing it at friends' houses or on special occasions gives the kids some flexibility. Not having TV except for a movie on weekends is strict, but again, there are alternatives. Video games are restricted, but the parent thinks they're not educational. Some kids need video games for social interaction with peers, but the parent's kids are involved in other activities. \n\nThe parent is concerned about addiction and negative effects, which are valid points. However, some might argue that complete restriction could lead to curiosity or rebellion later. But the kids are top of their class and well-behaved, so maybe the approach works for them. \n\nFamily and friends say they're too strict, but the parent sees the benefits in life skills. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong. In terms of legal or ethical wrongdoing, there's none. The parent's approach is a parenting style. However, in terms of being \"in the wrong\" socially or morally, it's subjective. \n\nThe parent's reasoning is based on their values and goals for their children's development. Unless the restrictions are causing harm or violating any laws, the parent isn't technically wrong. Different parenting styles exist, and as long as the children are safe, healthy, and developing well, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), as the parent is making choices they believe are in their children's best interest, and the kids are doing well.\n"
