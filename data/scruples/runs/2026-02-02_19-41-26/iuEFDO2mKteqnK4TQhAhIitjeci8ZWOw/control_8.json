We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have junk food at home, only allowing it on special occasions. They do allow an age-appropriate movie on weekends and prohibit video games because they see no educational value. The kids are doing well in school, are involved in extracurriculars, and are described as polite and well-behaved by others. The parent feels they might be too strict but defends their approach by saying these restrictions prevent addiction and negative influences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider child-rearing standards and what's commonly accepted. Many parents set boundaries around screen time and diet, so there's a range of acceptable practices. The key points here are that the kids are happy, successful, and well-rounded. The parent is providing alternatives like sports, theater, cooking, reading, and outdoor activities. The kids are getting positive outlets and are excelling academically and socially. \n\nThe parent is concerned about addiction and the negative impact of media and video games. While there's some validity to concerns about excessive screen time, the complete ban might be seen as extreme. However, the parent is allowing some flexibility with weekend movies, which suggests they aren't entirely restrictive. The question is whether this approach is \"wrong.\" \n\nThe parent's justification includes the kids' well-being and life skills, which are valid points. Other family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids are thriving. The line between being strict and being harmful isn't clear-cut. As long as the restrictions aren't causing harm and the children have other enriching activities, the parent's approach might be seen as protective rather than harmful. \n\nPotential counterarguments could be that denying all junk food and video games might not allow children to learn moderation, but the parent's stance is that these are addictive, so they prefer to eliminate them. Given that the kids are content and successful, it's hard to argue that the parent is in the wrong. The absence of negative consequences and the presence of positive outcomes suggest the parent is making a personal choice that works for their family. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
