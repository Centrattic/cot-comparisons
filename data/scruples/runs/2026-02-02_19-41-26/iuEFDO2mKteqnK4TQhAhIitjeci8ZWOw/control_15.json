We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the parent in the given situation is in the wrong. The parent doesn't allow their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games, except for occasional exceptions. The kids are doing well in school, are polite, and have various activities. Friends and family think they're too strict, but the parent believes the restrictions are for the kids' benefit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments for and against the parent's approach. On one hand, the parent is setting boundaries to promote healthy habits and avoid what they see as harmful influences. They mention that the kids are happy and successful, which suggests their approach might be effective. Also, the parent is providing alternative activities that are educational and social. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that kids need some level of normalcy and that completely banning things like junk food or video games could be overly restrictive. It's also possible that peer interactions where junk food is present might be important socially. However, the parent allows exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions, so maybe that's a balance. \n\nThe key factors here are the children's well-being. The kids are doing well academically, socially, and in terms of life skills. They don't seem to be unhappy. The parent's rationale is about preventing addiction and negative influences, and there's evidence that the approach is working. \n\nBut does that make them right? The question is whether they're in the wrong. If the kids are thriving under these rules, then it's hard to say the parent is wrong. However, if the restrictions are causing unnecessary stress or social challenges, maybe. But the parent says the kids are happy. \n\nIn terms of parenting styles, it's a strict approach, but not necessarily abusive. The alternatives provided (sports, cooking, etc.) are enriching. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) since the kids are well-adjusted and the parent has valid reasoning. But some might argue that flexibility is important. However, the parent allows exceptions, which shows some flexibility. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, strictness might be more accepted. The parent is making choices based on their beliefs about their kids' future, which is a common parenting approach. \n\nIn conclusion, given the positive outcomes for the children and the parent's reasoning, the answer is likely B. The parent isn't in the wrong because their approach is working for their kids.\n"
