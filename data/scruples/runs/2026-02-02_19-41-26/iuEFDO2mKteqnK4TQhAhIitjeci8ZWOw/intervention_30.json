We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is restricting their kids from junk food, TV, and video games. The kids are doing well in school, involved in activities, and are well-behaved. The parents believe that junk food and video games are harmful and that TV isn't educational. They also mention that other family and friends think they're too strict, but their kids have more life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents are making choices based on what they believe is best for their children. They allow exceptions for special occasions and friends' houses, which suggests they're not completely rigid. The kids are happy, involved in various activities, and performing well academically. The parents feel sometimes they might be too harsh but justify it by the benefits they see in their children.\n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. From a parental authority standpoint, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing. However, the line between discipline and overstrictness can be blurry. The parents are avoiding things they consider harmful, which is a common parenting approach. But some might argue that limiting access to these things entirely could be depriving kids of normal childhood experiences or necessary screen time for development, especially if it's age-appropriate.\n\nHowever, the parents are allowing some flexibility, like weekend movies, and the kids are thriving. The fact that they're learning life skills and are well-adjusted might indicate that their approach is working. The key is whether the restrictions are harmful. Since the children are happy and successful, it's hard to say the parents are wrong. But others might argue that no screen time at all is excessive, especially considering the educational aspects of some video games or the social aspects of TV.\n\nBut in the context of the question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide based on the information given. The parents' approach seems to be based on their values and they're providing alternative activities. Without evidence of harm to the children, it's more about differing parenting styles. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're making informed choices that are working for their family.\n"
