We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parent has two kids, a 7-year-old son and a 9-year-old daughter. They don't allow junk food at home, only on special occasions. They limit TV to age-appropriate weekend movies and no video games. The parent's reasoning is that junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. The kids are involved in extracurriculars, top of their class, and have good behavior. Family and friends think they're too strict, but the kids are happy and have life skills.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLooking at parenting styles, there's a balance between discipline and freedom. The parent is enforcing strict rules but provides alternatives like sports, theater, cooking, reading. The kids are thriving academically and socially. The parent is concerned about the effects of junk food, TV, and video games, which some studies support regarding screen time and health. However, some might argue that complete restriction could limit the kids' ability to learn moderation or socialize with peers who have these things. \n\nOn the other hand, the kids are happy, well-behaved, and engaged. The parent isn't banning these entirely but limits them to special occasions, which is a common practice. The key here is that the children's well-being is positive, and the parent is providing enriching activities. The parent also acknowledges feeling a bit harsh but justifies it for the child's benefit. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the focus is on whether the person's actions are unreasonable. Since the kids are doing well, and the parent isn't causing harm, it's more likely the answer is B (No). The strictness isn't leading to negative outcomes, and the parent is making informed decisions based on their values and research. Others might disagree, but as long as the kids are healthy and happy, it's not the parent's fault.\n"
