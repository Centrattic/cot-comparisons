We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong by not allowing their kids junk food, TV, and video games. The author has two kids, 7 and 9 years old. They don't have junk food at home, only on special occasions. No TV except for weekend movies. No video games because the parent thinks they're not educational. The kids are described as happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the author justifies it by saying these things are addictive and that their kids learn more life skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the balance between discipline and child development. The American Academy of Pediatrics has guidelines on screen time and nutrition for children. For example, they recommend limiting screen time to 1-2 hours per day for children over age 2. The author's kids only watch an age-appropriate movie on weekends, which seems within those guidelines. So maybe that's okay.\n\nRegarding junk food, the World Health Organization suggests reducing intake of salty, sugary, and fatty snacks. The author is not allowing junk food at home but allows it when visiting others, which might be reasonable to avoid making the kids feel deprived. It's a common approach many parents take.\n\nVideo games: The author's stance is that they find nothing educational about them. However, some studies show that certain video games can enhance problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, and strategic thinking. Completely banning them might limit exposure to these benefits. But the parent might have valid concerns about addiction or inappropriate content. Still, some moderation and age-appropriate games could be beneficial.\n\nThe kids are involved in various activities, which is positive. They're top of their class and well-behaved. The author mentions feeling harsh but justifies it based on addiction and mind-poisoning. However, it's important to consider the child's autonomy and social development. For example, if peers are allowed to have these things, the kids might feel isolated. The author's approach might be contributing to the children's success, but it's also important to consider their emotional well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on cultural norms, the child's needs, and whether the restrictions are reasonable. The author's approach is strict but has elements of positive parenting\u2014encouraging life skills and activities. However, completely denying access to TV and video games might be excessive. Some flexibility could help the children develop self-regulation and social skills by experiencing these activities in moderation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are good, the strictness might be excessive. The answer could be that they are not in the wrong (B), but it's a close call. Alternatively, if the restrictions are causing social or emotional harm, they might be in the wrong. But given the information, the kids seem happy and successful, so the answer is likely B.\n"
