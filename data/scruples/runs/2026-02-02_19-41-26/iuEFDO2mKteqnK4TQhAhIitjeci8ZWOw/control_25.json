We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is wrong for not allowing junk food, TV, and video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they have strict rules. The kids are happy, do well in school, and have lots of activities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasoning behind the parent's decisions. They think junk food is bad, TV and video games are addictive and not educational. They allow exceptions for friends' houses and special occasions. The kids are involved in sports, theater, cooking, etc., and are top of their class. Friends and family say they're too strict, but the parent believes in teaching life skills.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if this is wrong. The key points are the balance between discipline and child well-being. Are these restrictions reasonable? Some might argue that no TV or junk food at all is too strict, but others might agree with the parent's approach for health and education. The kids seem to be thriving academically and socially. The parent's justification about life skills and education is a strong point. Also, the kids are happy, which is a positive outcome. However, some studies suggest that moderate screen time can be okay, and occasional junk food isn't harmful. But the parent allows exceptions for special occasions, so maybe it's a balanced approach. The main question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Since the kids are doing well and the parent has their own reasoning, it's likely not the case. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
