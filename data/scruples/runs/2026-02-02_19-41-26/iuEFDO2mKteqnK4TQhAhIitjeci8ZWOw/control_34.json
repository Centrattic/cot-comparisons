We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The answer needs to be A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The parents have two kids, 7 and 9. They prohibit junk food at home, except on special occasions. They allow movies on weekends and no video games because they think they're not educational. The kids are happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. Family and friends say they're too strict, but the parents think the kids are learning life skills.\n\nSo, the key points here are the restrictions versus the kids' well-being. The parents are trying to avoid what they see as negative influences, but others think they're being harsh. The kids are doing well in school and have other activities, so maybe the restrictions aren't harmful. But is there an issue with completely forbidding these things?\n\nJunk food: Some might argue that it's okay to have some junk food in moderation. However, the parents are allowing it on special occasions, so that's a middle ground. TV and video games: complete bans might be too strict. Allowing age-appropriate movies on weekends seems reasonable, but video games are entirely off-limits. The parent mentions they see no educational value, but some games can have problem-solving skills or other benefits. However, the parent's stance is based on their opinion.\n\nThe kids are happy and engaged in other activities, so maybe the restrictions aren't causing harm. However, some might say that denying access to common childhood activities (like video games) could affect social interactions, since kids often play games with peers. But the kids are top of their class and well-behaved, so maybe the approach works for them.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. If the children are not harmed, are content, and the parents believe they're preparing them better, then maybe it's not wrong. But others might see it as too strict. The parents are also considering that they might be harsh, but they have their reasons. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some parents might allow more screen time, but it's a personal choice. Since the kids are thriving in other areas, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The parents' approach seems to work for their children, even if others disagree. The key is whether the children's needs are being met, which they seem to be.\n"
