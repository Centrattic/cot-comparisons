We don\u2019t allow our children to eat junk food, they will sometimes have it if they go to a friends house or on special occasions like Christmas,  but we have zero junk food in our house normally. They sometimes beg me to buy it but normally they\u2019re fine with what they have. We also don\u2019t allow them to watch tv. We do allow them to watch an age appropriate movie at the weekend. And we don\u2019t allow video games because I find absolutely nothing educational about them. Son has started asking to play but we\u2019ve just said no. \n\nBoth our children are happy most the time, they do lots of extracurricular activities, sport/theatre stuff, we teach them how to cook, we play games, we read, they go out on their bikes, play with our dog, listen to music, learn life skills. Both of them are top of their class at school and we are always complimented on how polite and well behaved our children are. \n\nSometimes I feel I\u2019m being a little bit harsh on them by restricting them from this stuff, but I also think this stuff is addictive and poisons their minds. Other family members and friends have told us we are way too strict, but Our kids know far more actual life skills than their peers. So AITA for the way I raise my children? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to eat junk food, watch TV, or play video games. The parent has two kids, 7 and 9, and they don't have these things at home. They do allow movies on weekends and some exceptions when friends have them. The kids are described as happy, involved in activities, top of their class, and well-behaved. The parent feels they might be too strict but believes the restrictions are for the kids' good.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider parenting styles and child development. Are there guidelines on screen time and junk food? Well, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limits on screen time for kids, like 1-2 hours per day for older kids, but they also acknowledge that some screen time can be educational. So if the parent is allowing no screen time at all, even for educational purposes, that might be more restrictive than necessary. However, they do allow a movie on weekends, which is a bit of screen time.\n\nRegarding junk food, it's common for parents to limit it to promote healthy eating habits. The parent allows it on special occasions, which is a balanced approach. But completely banning it might lead to an unhealthy relationship with food if the kids feel deprived, but the parent mentions the kids are fine with what they have, so maybe it's not an issue.\n\nVideo games: The parent says nothing educational about them. But some games can improve problem-solving, hand-eye coordination, and other skills. However, excessive gaming can be a problem. The parent's stance is strict, but the son is just starting to ask, so maybe it's a good time to introduce some age-appropriate games with limits.\n\nThe parent is concerned about addiction and mind poisoning. That's a common fear, but balance is key. The kids are engaged in other activities, which is positive. The parent's reasoning is to prevent addiction and promote life skills, which are valid points. However, completely restricting all forms of media and leisure activities might be too strict. Kids need downtime and some freedom to explore their interests.\n\nThe kids are happy and successful, which suggests the approach is working for now. But long-term effects could include social challenges if they're not exposed to common peer activities. Also, the parent's approach might not account for the kids' autonomy in choosing their activities as they grow older.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a matter of opinion. Some might say the parent is protecting the kids from harmful influences, while others argue that some flexibility is necessary for healthy development. The fact that other family members and friends call them too strict is a red flag, but the kids' well-being is the key. Since the kids are happy and thriving, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's room for more flexibility. The answer might depend on cultural context and the kids' needs for balance.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent's approach has merits, but there could be a middle ground. However, since the kids are happy and successful, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
