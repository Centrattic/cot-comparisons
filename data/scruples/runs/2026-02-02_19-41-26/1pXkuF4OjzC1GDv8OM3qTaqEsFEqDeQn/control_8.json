Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a twin sister who got into Cornell while the other sister, who is considered smarter and more accomplished, didn't get into any Ivy League schools, including Cornell. The author is conflicted because they want to go to Cornell, but it might upset their sister, who was really hoping to go there.\n\nFirst, the author's sister has higher stats: a 34 on the ACT (first try), better grades, and more impressive extracurriculars. The author feels they only got in due to a fluke and their school's grade inflation. The sister applied to engineering at Cornell, which might have different admission criteria. The author is worried about going to their sister's dream school, especially since they were supposed to go to school together.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's emotional state and the author's decision. The sister is already upset, crying, and angry at friends who got in with lower stats. The author is considering going to Cornell but is concerned about making their sister feel worse. However, the author is also experiencing their own excitement and fear of regretting not going.\n\nIs the author being selfish? Well, they haven't told their parents yet, which might compound the sister's sadness if they find out the author got in while the sister didn't. But the author is also following their own opportunity. Cornell is a great school, and the author has been accepted, so it's a valid choice. However, by choosing to go, they might be adding to their sister's distress, especially since they were supposed to attend together. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is not in the wrong for accepting their acceptance. The sister's application was to a different college (engineering) which might have different standards. The author's decision isn't about taking the sister's spot but about personal opportunity. The sister's reaction might be more about her own disappointment than the author's acceptance. \n\nThe author's dilemma is whether to prioritize their own happiness or their sister's. But since the sister didn't get into her first choice, and the author was accepted, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing Cornell. However, they should consider being supportive and maybe not making a big deal out of it until the sister has had time to process her rejection. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for going to Cornell, but they need to handle the situation with care to support their sister.\n"
