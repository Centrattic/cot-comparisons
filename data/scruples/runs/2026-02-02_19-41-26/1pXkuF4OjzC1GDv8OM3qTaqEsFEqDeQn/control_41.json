Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister didn't get in. The sister is really upset, and they were supposed to go to school together.\n\nFirst, the author got into Cornell, which is the sister's dream school. The sister is a high achiever with better stats, so not getting in must be really disappointing. The author feels guilty because they think they don't deserve it compared to their sister. The sister is now depressed and angry at friends who got into lower-tier schools. \n\nThe author is conflicted between their own desire to attend Cornell and the potential harm to their sister. They're considering sacrificing their spot to be with her in NYC. The question is whether the author is being selfish by going to Cornell.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's admission was unexpected, and they might feel it's an opportunity they can't pass up. On the other hand, their sister's emotional state is suffering, and the author might be adding to that by attending the school the sister wanted. However, it's also important that the author has the right to pursue their own opportunities. The sister's reaction seems extreme, possibly due to her own disappointment, and the author might not be the sole cause. The author isn't preventing the sister from attending another good school, like NYU. \n\nThe key points are the sister's emotional well-being versus the author's personal opportunity. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go to Cornell; they didn't cause the sister's rejection. The sister's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their own chance. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I should make sure there's no selfishness here. The author is considering their sister's feelings and even thinking of moving to NYC, which shows they care. Ultimately, it's their right to attend the school they got into, even if it upsets their sister.\n"
