Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell when their sister was rejected. The sister is described as more accomplished academically, but the author got in, possibly because they applied to a different college within Cornell. The author is conflicted because they feel guilty, as the sister was devastated and chose NYU, and they were supposed to go to school together. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points here. The author is questioning their decision to attend Cornell, knowing it's their sister's dream school. The sister is clearly upset, and the author is worried about being selfish. The key elements are the sister's emotional state, the author's feelings of guilt, and the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nThe sister applied to engineering, which might have different admission criteria. The author applied to Arts and Sciences and got in. The sister's rejection is a big blow, and the author is worried about attending Cornell and causing further distress. The author is considering moving to NYC with her, but if they go to Cornell, they'd be in a different location, which might hurt their sister's feelings.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is that the case? Well, the sister's dream school is Cornell, but the author is unsure if they are the one who made it. However, the author's sister applied to a different college within the same university. So maybe the criteria are different. The author's stats might not be as strong as their sister's, but the college they applied to might value different aspects. The author might not be in the wrong for just going to a school they were accepted to, especially since the sister's path wasn't the same.\n\nAlso, the author is genuinely concerned about their sister's well-being. They tried to console her and didn't tell the parents yet. The sister's depression isn't the author's fault; it's about her own experience and expectations. The author's desire to attend Cornell could be a positive for them, and maybe they can still support their sister by visiting or staying in touch, even if they go to different schools. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own opportunity, especially if the sister's decision to go to NYU is her own choice. \n\nMoreover, the sister's academic achievements don't guarantee admission to a college, as other factors like essays, interviews, or specific program requirements might play a role. The author's feelings of guilt are valid, but the situation isn't entirely their fault. They might be in a tough spot, but the wrong here isn't clear. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
