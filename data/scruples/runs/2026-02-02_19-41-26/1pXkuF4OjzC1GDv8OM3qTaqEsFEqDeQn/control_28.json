Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell while their sister didn't, especially since the sister was supposed to go to school together. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The sister is upset because she didn't get into Ivy League schools, including Cornell, which was her first choice. The author got in, but feels undeserving because their stats aren't as strong. They're considering going to Cornell, which might hurt their sister more.\n\nThe author is conflicted between their own desire to attend a prestigious school and the impact on their sister. The sister is now going to NYU but isn't the same. The author is worried about being selfish by going to Cornell, even though they're excited about the opportunity.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is wrong. The key points are: Did the author do something wrong by applying and accepting? Well, the author didn't do anything unethical in the application process. They applied, got in, and now are facing a personal dilemma. The sister's disappointment is a result of her own application outcome, not the author's actions. The author is trying to support their sister, but their own aspirations are conflicting with the sister's current emotional state.\n\nIs it wrong to pursue one's own opportunity because the sister is upset? The sister's rejection is her own issue, and the author's acceptance isn't their fault. However, the author is in a position where their decision affects their sister emotionally. The sister might feel resentful, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to attend a school they were accepted to. They are also considering going with her to NYC to support her, which shows they care.\n\nThe sister's reaction could be partly due to her own expectations and the pressure she put on herself. The author's acceptance might be a trigger for her self-doubt, but the author isn't responsible for that. The main question is whether the author is selfish for prioritizing their own dreams. Since they were accepted, it's reasonable for them to want to go, especially if they feel it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance. They aren't in the wrong for that. They should communicate with their sister, manage expectations, and maybe find a compromise, but the act of attending Cornell isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong. They should focus on supporting their sister while also pursuing their own opportunities, but they aren't at fault for the situation.\n"
