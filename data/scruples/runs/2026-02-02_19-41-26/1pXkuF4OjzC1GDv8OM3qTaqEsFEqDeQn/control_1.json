Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell when her sister was rejected. First, I need to understand the situation. The author and her twin sister both applied to Ivy League schools, with the sister applying to engineering at Cornell and the author to Arts and Sciences. The sister didn't get into any Ivy, while the author did. The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted because they had planned to go to school together, and the sister's dream school was Cornell.\n\nSo, the author is worried about being a bad sister by going to Cornell, especially since the sister worked harder and has better stats. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI think about whether the author has any control over the admissions process. Since both sisters applied to different colleges within the same university, the admission criteria might vary. The author mentions that the sister applied to engineering, which might be more competitive. The author's stats, while not as strong, might have fit the Arts and Sciences criteria better. So, the author isn't necessarily at fault for being accepted; it's just a matter of how different the colleges' requirements are.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction is more about her own disappointment than the author's acceptance. The author is trying to be supportive and hasn't told the parents yet. The sister is sad and angry at friends who got into lower-tier schools. The author's decision to go to Cornell isn't something that can be controlled by her; it's an external outcome. \n\nSelfishness would come into play if the author was deliberately making the sister sad, but the author is genuinely conflicted and considering the sister's feelings. However, it's also valid for the author to want to take the opportunity if it's right for her. The sister's reaction might be more about her own rejection than the author's acceptance. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being accepted. They both put in their applications, and the decision was up to the schools. The real issue might be the sister's emotional response, but the author isn't responsible for that. The answer should be B (No).\n"
