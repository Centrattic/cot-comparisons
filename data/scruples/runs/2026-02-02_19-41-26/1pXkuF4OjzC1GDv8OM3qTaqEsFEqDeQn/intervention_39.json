Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the a\\*hole for getting into Cornell when their sister didn't, even though the sister had better stats. The sister was really upset, and they were supposed to go to school together. The author feels guilty but wants to go to Cornell.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The sister had better grades, a higher ACT, and more extracurriculars. The author thinks the sister's rejection is because she applied to engineering while they applied to Arts and Sciences. Maybe Cornell has different admission standards for different colleges. So the author might not be in the wrong because they applied to a different program with different criteria.\n\nBut the sister is their twin, and they were planning to go to school together. The author is worried about hurting her. However, the author is also excited about their own opportunity. Is it selfish to want to go to a dream school, even if it upsets their sister? Or is it their right to take the offer since they got in, regardless of the sister's feelings?\n\nAlso, the sister is already planning to go to NYU, but she's been sad. The author hasn't told the parents yet, who might have assumed they both got rejected. The author is considering going to Cornell even if it makes their sister unhappy. \n\nI think the key points are: the author wasn't trying to hurt their sister, they were surprised themselves. The sister's dream school was Cornell, but the author got into a different college there. The author is concerned about their sister's feelings, which shows they care. But the author is also making a personal choice about their education. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They can't control the admissions outcome. They should communicate with their sister and parents, but accepting a school offer isn't inherently wrong. The sister's reaction is her responsibility, but the author is trying to support her even after their own surprise acceptance. The guilt might be misplaced if they didn't do anything wrong. I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's some nuance. The author should be considerate, but they're not obligated to give up their chance just because their sister is upset. The sister's expectations were based on her own stats, and the author's acceptance is valid.\n"
