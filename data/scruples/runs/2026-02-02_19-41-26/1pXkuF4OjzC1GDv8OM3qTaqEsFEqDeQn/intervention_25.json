Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister, who's more accomplished, didn't get in. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a twin sister who got into Cornell, which was her sister's dream school. Her sister has better stats (higher ACT, grades, extracurriculars) and applied to the engineering college there but got rejected. The sister is now really upset and even more so because the author got in. The author is conflicted because she wants to go to Cornell but doesn't want to hurt her sister.\n\nThe author is asking if she's in the wrong (AITA) for going to the school her sister wanted. The key points here are about family dynamics, personal desires versus the impact on a sibling, and the validity of the question of \"wrongdoing.\"\n\nI think the first thing to consider is that college admissions are subjective and don't always reflect a student's abilities. Different colleges have different criteria, and the author applied to Arts and Sciences while her sister applied to Engineering. Even if the sister has better stats, the departments might have different priorities. So maybe it's not about who's more deserving but about what each college is looking for. \n\nThen, the author is considering whether she's being selfish by going to Cornell. But is it actually wrong? The sister's reaction is a factor here. If the author going to Cornell is causing her sister significant emotional distress, the author might need to consider that. However, the sister's depression might be more about her own rejection rather than the author's acceptance. The author could try talking to her sister to understand her feelings better. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they always thought they'd go to school together, but now that's not happening. The author is caught between her own desire and the sister's feelings. But is it the author's responsibility to forgo her own opportunity because her sister is upset? That could be a heavy burden. The sister might need support regardless of the author's decision. \n\nI should also think about the concept of \"wrong\" here. If the author is making a choice that's in her best interest and within her rights, even if it upsets her sister, is she in the wrong? The sister's feelings are important, but they don't necessarily make the author at fault. The sister's reaction might be a result of her own disappointment, not the author's acceptance. \n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to decide if she should go to NYU with her sister. But is that the sister's choice? The sister decided to go to NYU, so maybe the author can support her sister by going there, but that's a personal decision. The author's own happiness and educational goals are also valid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author can't control her sister's emotions, but she can try to communicate and offer support. The author isn't doing anything unethical by attending Cornell. The sister's distress is more about her own situation than the author's acceptance. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pursuing her own opportunity, even if it's a school her sister wanted.\n"
