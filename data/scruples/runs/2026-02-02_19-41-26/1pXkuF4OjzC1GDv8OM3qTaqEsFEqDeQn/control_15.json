Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell when her twin sister, who they consider the smarter one, was rejected. The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted about whether she should go to Cornell instead of joining her sister at NYU.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main ethical or moral issue here. The author is worried that going to Cornell would hurt her sister's feelings. But does that mean she's in the wrong for accepting an offer to a school she got into? The sister's emotions are valid, but the author's decision is about her own future. \n\nThe author mentions she's not as \"smart\" and has less impressive stats, but got in maybe because of the different college within Cornell (Arts and Sciences vs. Engineering). The sister is upset and angry at friends who got into top schools with lower stats. The author wants to go to Cornell, which she's been researching, and feels like a dream opportunity. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Well, she is acknowledging the sister's feelings and considering their previous plan to attend school together. But she also has her own desires and a valid acceptance. The sister's decision to go to NYU is her own, even though she's depressed. The author's choice to attend Cornell is her right, as she was accepted. However, her not informing the parents might be a separate issue. \n\nThe key points are: the author's acceptance is genuine, she's considering the sister's feelings but not forcing her to change her decision, and the sister's choice to go to NYU is final. The author's internal conflict is about her own happiness vs. her sister's feelings. But ultimately, she's not the one rejected; the sister is, so the author isn't in the wrong for taking the opportunity. The sister's distress might stem from her own rejections rather than the author's acceptance. The author isn't preventing the sister from going to another school; the sister made that choice. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
