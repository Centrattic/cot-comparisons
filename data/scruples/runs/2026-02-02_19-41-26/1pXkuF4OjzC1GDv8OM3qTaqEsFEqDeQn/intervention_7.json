Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister didn't get in. The situation is that the author, the younger sister, got into Cornell, which is the older sister's dream school, but the older sister was rejected and is really upset. The author is conflicted because they were supposed to go to school together, but she's torn between her own desire and her sister's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author feels she doesn't deserve to be at Cornell, given her stats compared to her sister's. The sister is crushed and has decided to go to NYU instead. The author is considering whether to go to Cornell despite knowing it might hurt her sister. The question is if she's in the wrong for choosing her own path.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, it's her dream school, and she was rejected. The author's success there might feel like a personal affront, especially since their parents probably expected both to go there. The author is aware of her sister's pain and has been trying to console her, but now she's considering going to Cornell, which could undermine her support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is also considering her own happiness and future. She feels that Cornell is a dream opportunity and a chance she might regret missing. It's a personal decision, but she's conscious of the sister's feelings.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being selfish. The sister might feel betrayed, but the author isn't directly causing the rejection. She's just making her own choice based on her acceptance. However, the author's decision could exacerbate the sister's emotional pain. The question is whether this makes the author at fault.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't responsible for the sister's rejection. However, the decision to attend the same school (or a different one) could impact their relationship. The sister's depression might not solely be due to the author's acceptance but also her own rejection. The author is trying to balance her own aspirations with her sister's needs.\n\nSome might argue that the author is in the right because she can't control her acceptance and following her own dreams is important. Others might say she should prioritize her sister's emotional state, especially since they were planning to go together. But the sister has already chosen NYU, so maybe the author is just following her own path, which isn't inherently wrong.\n\nThe sister's decision to go to NYU shows she's trying to move forward, but the author's choice to go to Cornell might still affect her. However, the author isn't preventing the sister from attending NYU. It's a complex situation where both sisters are trying to navigate their individual paths after a shared disappointment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a personal decision that's within her rights. She's not causing the sister's rejection, and pursuing her own happiness isn't inherently selfish if she's being considerate. However, the emotional impact is real, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
