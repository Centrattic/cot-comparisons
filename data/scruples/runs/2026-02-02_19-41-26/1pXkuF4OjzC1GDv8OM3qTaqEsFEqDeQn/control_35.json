Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author (the sister who got into Cornell) is at fault for wanting to attend the school that her twin sister, who didn't get in, had wanted.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the sister got into Cornell, which was her twin's dream school. The twin is upset and the author is considering whether to go, even though it might hurt her sister's feelings. The sister is more accomplished in terms of grades and extracurriculars. They had planned to go to school together, but the author got in while the sister didn't, leading to her depression.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's decision to attend Cornell despite the emotional impact on her sister. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nI need to think about the responsibilities of the author here. The author's sister is struggling emotionally because she didn't get into her top choice, and the author's success might feel like a salt in the wound. However, the author also has her own desires and the opportunity might be a once-in-a-lifetime chance. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Well, the author didn't intentionally sabotage the sister's application. The sister's disappointment is due to the admissions outcome, which is out of the author's control. That said, the author is aware of the sister's feelings and is conflicted about attending. The question is whether it's wrong for the author to pursue her own opportunity even if it makes her sister sad.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, people are generally allowed to make their own life choices, even if others are upset. However, if the author is aware that her decision will cause significant harm, maybe she should try to address that harm. For example, supporting her sister more, or perhaps considering if going together is possible (but in this case, they can't both go to Cornell if the sister didn't get in). \n\nThe author is considering going to Cornell on her own, which is her right. But the sister is depressed, and the author might have a duty to consider that. However, the author is also dealing with her own feelings and the possibility of regret if she doesn't go. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being selfish. The sister's dream school is where the author is going. However, the sister's decisions and emotional state are her own responsibility, not the author's. The author can't be blamed for the sister's reaction, but she might need to take steps to support her sister. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong for wanting to go. \n\nSince the author didn't do anything to cause the sister to be rejected, and the situation is partly due to different admission criteria (engineering vs. arts), the author isn't at fault. The sister's disappointment is not the author's responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
