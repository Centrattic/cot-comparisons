Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a twin sister who got into her sister's dream school, Cornell, while the smarter sister didn't get in. The author is conflicted about attending Cornell because it would upset her sister, who's already depressed about not getting in. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels like they don't deserve to be at Cornell because their stats aren't as impressive as her sister's. But they got in maybe because they applied to a different college within Cornell. The sister is devastated and has been crying, and the author is worried about hurting her feelings by going.\n\nThe key points are: Is the author selfish for wanting to go to Cornell when her sister wanted it more? The author is considering if they should give up their spot to make her sister happy. But the question is whether the author is actually in the wrong.\n\nWell, the author got into Cornell through their own application process. They didn't take the sister's place or do anything unethical. The sister applied to engineering, the author to arts and sciences. Different admission criteria. The author is struggling with guilt because they feel they don't deserve it compared to their sister. But is that their fault? The author can't control the admissions decision. The sister's mental health is a concern, but the author isn't responsible for the sister's rejection. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for attending the school they were accepted to. However, they should consider supporting their sister's well-being. Maybe they can still attend Cornell but find ways to support their sister, like visiting or staying in touch. The real issue is the author's guilt, but they aren't at fault for the outcome. They have the right to pursue their own education. Therefore, the answer would be B, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
