Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, a twin sister, got into Cornell while her sister, who they describe as smarter and with better stats, didn't get in. The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted about going to Cornell, knowing it might hurt her sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is a twin, and they were supposed to go to school together. The sister applied to a different college at Cornell (engineering) versus Arts and Sciences. The sister's stats are objectively better. The author feels like they don't deserve to be there and is worried about making her sister feel worse. The sister is already depressed, and the author is considering whether to go to Cornell or join her in NYC.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is that accurate? Let's break it down. The author is in a tough spot. They are conflicted between their own happiness and their sister's feelings. The sister is struggling, and the author is considering whether to go to their dream school despite the potential harm to their sister.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Well, if the author is making a choice that's right for them, even if it's painful for their sister, that might not be their fault. The sister's disappointment is unfortunate, but the author can't control the admissions decisions. The author is trying to support their sister but also has their own desires. \n\nHowever, the author is aware of the sister's feelings and is considering alternatives. The question is whether they're selfish. But the author is also in a position where they didn't expect to get in. It's a complex situation. The sister might need more support, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to attend a school they were accepted to. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for choosing their own path, even if it upsets their sister. The sister's emotional state is a separate issue, and the author is already trying to be considerate. The author can't be blamed for the admissions outcome, which was outside their control.\n"
