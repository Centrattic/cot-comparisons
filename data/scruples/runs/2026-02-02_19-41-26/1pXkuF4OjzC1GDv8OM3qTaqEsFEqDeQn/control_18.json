Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell when her sister, who's more accomplished, didn't. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and her twin sister. The sister has better stats\u2014higher ACT, better grades, more extracurriculars. She applied to engineering at Cornell, didn't get in, and is devastated. The author applied to Arts and Sciences, got in, maybe due to different admission criteria. Now the author is conflicted about attending because it might hurt her sister's feelings. They were supposed to go to school together, but the sister is going to NYU instead.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author is selfish for wanting to go to Cornell despite her sister's disappointment. The author feels guilty because her sister worked harder and it was her dream school. But the author also feels like she got in by chance and wants to seize the opportunity.\n\nI need to consider if the author has a moral obligation to prioritize her sister's feelings over her own desires. But here's the thing: each person's education and future are their own. The sister chose NYU, which might still be a good school. The author getting into Cornell is her own achievement, even if she feels it's a fluke. The sister's sadness is real, but should the author's decision be based on that? Maybe the sister needs time to process, but the author shouldn't necessarily give up her chance because of it. Also, the sister's decision to go to NYU is her own, so maybe the author isn't directly causing the problem but is part of the emotional dynamic. However, the author could support her sister while still attending Cornell. It's not like the author is preventing her sister from going; the sister didn't get in. The author's attendance doesn't take away from the sister's opportunities. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
