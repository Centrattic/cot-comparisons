Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell while her sister didn't. The situation is that the sister is a high-achiever with better stats, but got rejected from all Ivy Leagues, including Cornell, which was her first choice. The author got in, maybe because of different college admission criteria at Cornell (Arts vs. Engineering). The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted about going to Cornell versus staying with her sister in NYC.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is at fault. The author is not doing anything illegal or unethical. She got into the school through the admissions process, which is fair. The sister applied to a different college within the same university, which might have different admission standards. So the author isn't directly responsible for the sister's rejection. However, the author's decision to attend might add to the sister's emotional pain.\n\nBut is it the author's fault to want to go to Cornell? The author feels conflicted because she knows it would hurt her sister. But she's also excited for her own opportunity. The key here is whether the author is being selfish. The sister is the one who decided to go to NYU, so the author isn't forcing her to go elsewhere. The author is in a tough spot because they were supposed to go to school together, but the sister's choice is already made. The author is caught between her own happiness and her sister's feelings.\n\nBut the sister's emotional state is a result of her own rejections, not the author's acceptance. The author is in a position where she's been accepted and wants to take that chance. It's a personal decision. The sister is an adult, and the author isn't making her go to Cornell. The author is just choosing her own path. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. She's being honest about her feelings and her desire to go to Cornell. It's not her fault that the sister is upset, especially since the sister's application was separate. The author is trying to balance her own dreams with her sister's emotions. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. The author could be seen as insensitive, but it's not like she's doing something wrong. She's not to blame for the sister's rejection. So the answer is B.\n"
