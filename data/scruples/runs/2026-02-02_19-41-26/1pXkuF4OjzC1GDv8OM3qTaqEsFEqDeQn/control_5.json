Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The main points are that the author, who's the twin sister, got into Cornell while her smarter sister didn't. The sister is really upset and wants to go to NYC, maybe NYU, but the author is conflicted because they were supposed to go to school together. The author is worried about being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key elements here. The author is questioning their decision to attend Cornell, which was her sister's dream school. The sister has higher stats, got rejected from Ivy League schools including Cornell, and is now depressed. The author feels guilty because she got in under less competitive circumstances, maybe because she applied to a different college within Cornell. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing her own opportunity. The sister's feelings are a big part of the situation. The author is considering going with her to NYC to support her sister but is also excited about Cornell. The sister's dream school not accepting her is a major factor in her depression. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Attending a school is a personal decision, but the sister's emotional state is important. However, the author's admission might not be due to the sister's efforts. The sister's application was to engineering, which might have different criteria. The author's desire to go to Cornell despite the sister's feelings could be seen as selfish, but the sister's decision to go to NYU might be her own choice now. \n\nThe sister is upset because of her own rejections, not necessarily because the author is attending a better school. The author's presence at Cornell might not be the main issue. The sister might need emotional support, but the author can still support her from afar. The author isn't preventing the sister from attending another school; the sister chose NYU. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she wasn't responsible for her sister's rejections. The sister's choice to go to a different school is her own. The author's decision to attend Cornell is a personal opportunity, and while it's kind to consider the sister, she's not obligated to sacrifice her own happiness. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
