Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a twin sister who got into Cornell, which her sister was really hoping to attend. The sister didn't get into any Ivy Leagues, including Cornell, and is now really upset. The author is conflicted because going to Cornell is her dream, but she feels bad because her sister was rejected and is depressed. They were planning to go to school together, but the author is considering going to Cornell instead, even though it might hurt her sister.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. She got into Cornell through the admissions process, and she has the right to accept the offer. However, the moral aspect here is about her sister's feelings. The sister is already struggling, and the author's decision might add to her pain. But the author is also trying to make her own decisions about her future, which is important.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's mental health and the bond between the twins. The sister is being supportive of the author, even though she's upset. The author is aware of the sister's feelings but still feels conflicted about her own desires. The question is whether the author's decision to go to Cornell is wrong.\n\nIn similar situations, it's important to consider how to balance personal aspirations with family relationships. The author isn't actively harming her sister; she's just making a choice that might cause sadness. But the sister's depression is a serious issue. The author should probably have a conversation with her sister to understand how to support her while also making her own decision. However, the author's own happiness is also valid. Since the author isn't obligated to give up her opportunity, and the sister's feelings aren't necessarily her fault, the answer might lean towards not in the wrong. But the author should handle the situation sensitively. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
