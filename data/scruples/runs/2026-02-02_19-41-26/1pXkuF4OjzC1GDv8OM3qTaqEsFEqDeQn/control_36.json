Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got into Cornell, which is their twin sister's dream school, but the sister didn't get in. The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted about whether to go to Cornell or join their sister at NYU. They're asking if they're the a**hole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author feels they don't deserve to be at Cornell because their stats are lower compared to their sister's. They believe the sister is more qualified, with a higher ACT score, better grades, and stronger extracurriculars. The sister applied to engineering, which might have different admission criteria, but she didn't get into any Ivy League schools. The author is worried that going to Cornell would hurt their sister's feelings and make her feel worse, especially since they were supposed to go to school together. However, the author is really excited about Cornell and fears regret if they don't go.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether going to Cornell is selfish in this context. The sister is already struggling with rejections, and the author's acceptance might exacerbate her feelings of inadequacy. But does that mean the author is wrong to want to go to their dream school?\n\nThe author did not intentionally sabotage the sister's chances. Admissions can be subjective and depend on various factors beyond just stats, like essays, interviews, or fit with the college's criteria. The sister applied to a different college within Cornell, which might have different requirements. So the author's acceptance isn't directly the reason the sister didn't get in. The author is also trying to support the sister, not mock her.\n\nHowever, the author is aware of the sister's pain and the emotional impact of attending the same school. The question is about the author's responsibility to their sister's feelings. Is it selfish to prioritize their own opportunity, especially when the sister is already hurting? Or is it natural for the author to want to take a chance at a great opportunity, considering that the admissions process isn't entirely merit-based?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister decided to go to NYU, but isn't the same person. The author's presence at Cornell could be a comfort, but they might be avoiding the possibility of their sister feeling more alone in her disappointment. However, the author also feels strongly about attending Cornell and not regretting the decision. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't taking away the sister's chance; the admissions decision is independent. The author's acceptance is a personal achievement, even if they feel undeserving. It's possible the author is overestimating their sister's reaction, but they are trying to be considerate. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They should be supportive of their sister and maybe communicate openly about their feelings. But the decision to go to Cornell isn't inherently selfish, given that the author didn't cause the sister's rejection and is also entitled to pursue their own education. The key is balancing their own aspirations with empathy for their sister's situation. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
