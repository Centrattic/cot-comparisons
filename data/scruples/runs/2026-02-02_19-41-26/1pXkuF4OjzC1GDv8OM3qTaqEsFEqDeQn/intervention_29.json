Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author got into Cornell, which is their sister's dream school. The sister didn't get in despite having better stats. The author is conflicted because they promised to go to school together, but now they're considering going to Cornell anyway, which might hurt their sister.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The sister is upset and angry, choosing NYU. The author feels guilty but also excited about Cornell. The question is about whether the author is being selfish by going to Cornell instead of NYU. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't have a strong academic profile compared to their sister, and they think it was a fluke. They acknowledge the sister's merits and the possibility that different application colleges at Cornell had different criteria. The main issue is the emotional impact on the sister versus the author's personal desire.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Is it wrong to pursue your own dream school even if it might upset your sister? Well, the author and sister were supposed to go to school together, but the sister is already devastated. The sister's choice to go to NYU is her own decision, but the author's choice to go to Cornell could affect their relationship. \n\nHowever, the author hasn't told their parents yet, which might be a separate issue. But the main question is about the sister. The author is in a position where they might be causing additional emotional pain. But is that considered being in the wrong? \n\nOn one hand, the author should consider their sister's feelings and maybe find ways to support her, like visiting or staying close. On the other hand, the author's own educational and personal goals are important. It's not like they're actively trying to hurt the sister; they're just following their own path. The sister's reaction is intense, but perhaps she needs to process her own disappointment without the author's decision being blamed on them. \n\nThe author might be feeling guilty because they think they didn't earn it as much as their sister. But that's their own perception. The actual rightness of the situation depends on whether the author acted maliciously. Since the author is trying to console the sister and is conflicted, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B, No. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go to their own dream school, but they should handle the situation with empathy and communication. The sister's feelings are important, but the author's decision to attend Cornell isn't inherently wrong. They should talk to their sister about how to support each other, maybe find a compromise, but the act of accepting the offer isn't selfish if done with consideration.\n"
