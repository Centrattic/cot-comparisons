Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister, who has better stats, got rejected. They were supposed to go to school together, but now the sister is really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author feels guilty because she got into a top school while her sister didn't, even though she thinks her sister is more deserving. The sister is clearly hurt and depressed, which is a big factor. The author is conflicted between her own desire to attend Cornell and the impact it has on her sister.\n\nThe author's reasons for wanting to go to Cornell are valid\u2014she's excited about the school and the opportunity. She mentions that she feels like it's a fluke, but she's happy. However, her sister's emotional well-being is suffering because of this. The sister applied to engineering at Cornell, which might have different admission criteria, but the author isn't sure if that's the reason she got in. \n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, she's not directly causing the rejection; that's the admissions decision. But her attending the school might make her sister feel worse, especially since they had planned to go together. The author is being considerate by not telling their parents yet and trying to figure out the best path. \n\nIs it selfish to prioritize her own happiness over her sister's? Maybe a bit, but it's also important to balance personal dreams with family. However, the key point is that the author isn't the reason her sister was rejected. She can't control admissions, and going to Cornell doesn't negate her sister's achievements. \n\nThe sister might need time to process, and the author might need to support her while also making her own choice. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to attend. The main issue is the sister's emotional state, but that's more about the admissions outcome than the author's decision to accept the offer. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for accepting an offer she earned, even if it's hurtful to her sister. The sister's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's choice is her own.\n"
