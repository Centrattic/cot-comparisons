Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a twin sister who got into Cornell while her smarter, more accomplished sister didn't. The sister is really upset, and the author is torn between going to Cornell or joining her sister at NYU.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels like she doesn't deserve to be at Cornell, thinking her sister, who has better credentials, should have been accepted. The sister is devastated, even to the point of crying and being angry at friends. The author is anxious about making the right choice and is worried about being selfish by choosing her own dream school over her sister's.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the core of the issue is whether her decision to attend Cornell is selfish. The sister's feelings are valid and important, but the author's own desires and the fact that she got accepted can't be ignored. The sister's decision to go to NYU is her own, even if it's not her first choice. The author's presence at Cornell isn't something she can control; the admissions were based on different criteria for different colleges. The author isn't responsible for the sister's rejection. The sister's depression might be a result of her own application results, not the author's acceptance. \n\nThe author is trying to do the right thing by considering her sister's feelings, but she also has her own aspirations. The question is whether choosing her own path makes her the \"bad\" sister. It's a tough spot, but the author isn't in the wrong for pursuing her own opportunities. The sister's reaction is more about her own disappointment than the author's actions. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
