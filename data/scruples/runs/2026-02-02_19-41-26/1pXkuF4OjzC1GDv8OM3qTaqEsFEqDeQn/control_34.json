Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"AITA\" story) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is the twin sister of someone who didn't get into their dream school (Cornell), got in despite having lower stats. The sister who didn't get in is really upset, and the author is conflicted about going to Cornell because they were supposed to go together.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The author feels like they don't deserve to be at Cornell, thinking it was a fluke. Their sister is more qualified, with higher ACT scores, better grades, and more impressive extracurriculars. The sister applied to the engineering college at Cornell, which might have different admission criteria, and didn't get in. The author, on the other hand, applied to Arts and Sciences and got in. Now, the author is considering attending despite the sister's devastation, which is causing them guilt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go to Cornell. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is in a situation where their personal achievement might be causing pain to their sister. However, they also have the right to pursue their own education and happiness. The sister's application outcomes are separate; the author's admission doesn't negate the sister's qualifications. The sister's emotional response is significant, but the author isn't to blame for the admissions decisions. The author is also dealing with their own surprise acceptance and the desire to attend a school they always thought was out of reach.\n\nIs the author being selfish? Well, they're considering their own desires but are also aware of the impact on their sister. However, they can't be held responsible for the sister's emotional state solely because they got in. The sister might need support, but that doesn't mean the author should forgo their opportunity. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to go to a school they were accepted to, especially if it's a genuine opportunity they value. It's a personal choice that might require empathy and support towards the sister, but not necessarily a moral wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong). The author isn't at fault for their own success or for wanting to take the opportunity given to them. The sister's disappointment is unfortunate, but the author's decision to attend isn't the wrong here.\n"
