Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a twin sister getting into Cornell, which was her first choice, while the other sister, who's considered the smarter one, was rejected. The author is conflicted because she wants to go to Cornell despite knowing it would upset her sister, who was planning to go to NYU instead. They were supposed to go to school together.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author feels undeserving, thinks she got in by a fluke, and her sister has better stats. The sister is really sad and even angry at friends who got into lower-tier schools. The author is considering going to Cornell, which her sister wanted, but they had a plan to go together. Now, the author is worried about being selfish.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI should consider the dynamics between the sisters. The author's sister is clearly hurt and disappointed. The author is aware that attending Cornell might devastate her sister. The sister's emotional state has been affected, and she's making decisions based on her rejection. The author is facing her own desire to attend a prestigious school versus her sister's feelings.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? The author didn't manipulate the admissions process. She genuinely believes she got in by luck. However, she's choosing to go, even though it was her sister's dream school. The sister might feel that her sister took her dream, especially if they had a plan to attend together. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to give up her opportunity. The sister made the decision to go to NYU after her own rejections. The author might not be in the wrong for pursuing her own education choice, even if it's a shared dream. But there's a sense of guilt and consideration for her sister's feelings. \n\nThe sister's emotional response is significant. The author's actions, while not malicious, could be seen as selfish because they don't consider the sister's emotional impact. However, the sister had the chance to choose another path. The author's dilemma is about personal choice vs. family dynamics. \n\nI think the answer is not in the author's wrong. She didn't do anything malicious. The sister's feelings are important, but the author isn't the reason she got rejected. The sister's decision to go to NYU is her own. The author is in a tough spot, but it's not her fault. So answer B.\n"
