Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell when her sister didn't. The sister was really upset, and they had planned to go to school together. The author is torn between her own desire to attend her accepted school and the fear of hurting her sister's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author got into Cornell, which is her sister's dream school, while her sister was rejected. The sister is already struggling with her own rejections, and the author is worried that going to Cornell would add to her sister's pain. The sister is planning to go to NYU, but she's been depressed and angry about not getting into top schools.\n\nThe author is questioning if she's being selfish. On one hand, she's happy about getting into a place she didn't expect, and she's excited about the opportunity. On the other hand, she's aware that her sister is going through a tough time. The key points here are the sister's emotional state, the sister's hard work and higher qualifications, and the author's own feelings about attending Cornell.\n\nI should think about whether the author's decision to go to Cornell is inherently wrong. The sister's dream school is being taken by the author, but the sister is choosing NYU despite that. The author is not forcing her sister to stay; the sister is making her own choice. However, the author is causing additional emotional pain by going to a school that was the sister's first choice. But is the author responsible for the sister's emotional state? The sister's depression seems more related to her own rejections rather than the author's acceptance. \n\nAlso, the author didn't apply to the same college as her sister, which might have affected admissions. The sister applied to engineering, which might have different criteria, while the author applied to Arts and Sciences. So the different colleges could explain the outcome, but that's just a factor. The author is aware of that, but still feels guilty.\n\nThe author is considering going to Cornell, which is a valid choice for herself. She's not obligated to give up her spot just because her sister didn't get in. However, she should consider the impact on her sister and try to support her. Maybe the author could still go to Cornell but make an effort to be there for her sister, perhaps by visiting or staying in close contact. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for attending her accepted school. The sister's choice to go to NYU is her own decision, and the author can't control her sister's reactions. The author isn't doing anything to prevent the sister from attending her chosen school. The sister's depression is a result of her own rejections, not the author's acceptance. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for attending Cornell. She's making a choice that's right for herself, even though it might cause temporary hurt feelings. The author should focus on supporting her sister while also pursuing her own opportunity.\n"
