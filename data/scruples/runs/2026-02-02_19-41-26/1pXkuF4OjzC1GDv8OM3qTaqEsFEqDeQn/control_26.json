Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting into Cornell, which was their twin sister's dream school, while the sister was rejected. The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted about going to Cornell.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The sister is clearly the high-achiever with better stats, and she applied to engineering at Cornell, which might have different admission criteria than the author's Arts and Sciences. The author feels they were accepted by a fluke, given their lower ACT and GPA. The sister is devastated, and the author is worried about going to Cornell because it might hurt her feelings, but they really want to go.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about fairness, empathy, and the sister's emotional state. The author is considering their own desires but also the impact on their sister. The sister applied to a more competitive college within Cornell, so maybe the author's acceptance was based on different criteria. The author is struggling with whether to go to Cornell despite the sister's feelings.\n\nThe community usually looks at whether the person is being selfish or not considering others' feelings. The author is aware that the sister is upset and is conflicted. They're not trying to hide their acceptance but are worried about the sister's reaction. The sister didn't get into her first choice and is now depressed. The author wants to support her but also has their own dreams.\n\nI think the author is in a tough spot. They're not necessarily in the wrong because they were accepted to a school they worked for, even if it's their sister's dream school. The sister's application was to a different college, so it's possible the author's application was stronger for their specific college. The author is also showing empathy by considering the sister's feelings and not wanting to hurt her. The sister's reaction might be more about her own disappointment than the author's acceptance. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go to Cornell. The answer should be B.\n"
