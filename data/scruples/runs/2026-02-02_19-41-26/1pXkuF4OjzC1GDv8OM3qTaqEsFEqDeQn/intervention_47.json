Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell while her sister didn't, especially since her sister was the one who worked harder and had better stats.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a twin sister who got into Cornell, which was her sister's dream school. The sister didn't get in and is really upset, even considering going to NYU instead. The author is torn because she wants to go to Cornell but is worried about hurting her sister's feelings. She's also unsure if she deserves to be there since she felt it was a fluke.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author succeeded in getting into a school that her sister really wanted, and the sister is now struggling emotionally. The author is questioning if it's right for her to go, given the sister's feelings and the fact that she might have been less qualified.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Is the author at fault? Well, she's not the one who caused the sister's rejection. The admissions process is subjective and based on many factors beyond just test scores and grades. The author is considering her own feelings and the sister's, and she's trying to decide if going to Cornell is selfish.\n\nBut from a fairness standpoint, the author shouldn't be blamed for getting in when she did, especially since the sister's application might have been affected by other factors, like the college (engineering vs. Arts and Sciences) as the author mentioned. The sister's decision to go to NYU is her own, even if she's unhappy. The author is conflicted but not necessarily in the wrong for accepting her offer. However, there's a question of whether she should prioritize her sister's emotional state over her own desires.\n\nBut the real issue here is the author's internal conflict and her perception of fairness. The sister's feelings are hurt, but the author isn't responsible for the sister's application outcome. The author is being self-aware and considers the sister's perspective. The key is whether the author is making a selfish choice by not going to NYU with her sister. But the sister is making her own choice, not the author. The author can't control where the sister goes; she can only choose based on her own circumstances and desires.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for accepting her admission. She's in the right to pursue her own opportunities, even if it's a school her sister also wanted. The sister's reaction is a result of her own application and feelings, not the author's actions. The author is empathetic and acknowledges the sister's pain, which shows she's not being intentionally selfish. The answer should be B, No, because the author isn't at fault for her own success. The sister's sadness is a personal response, and the author can't be held responsible for that.\n"
