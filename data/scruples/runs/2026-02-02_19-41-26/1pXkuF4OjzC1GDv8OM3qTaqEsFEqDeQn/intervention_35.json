Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a twin sister, got into Cornell while her smarter, more accomplished sister didn't. The sister is really upset, and the author is considering whether to go to Cornell or move with her sister to NYU.\n\nFirst, the author feels guilty because she knows her sister worked harder and has better stats. The sister was applying to engineering at Cornell, which might have different admission criteria than Arts and Sciences. The author didn't even expect to get in and is struggling with the decision to go, which would mean not being with her sister. The author is worried about hurting her sister's feelings and possibly making her more depressed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to go to Cornell despite knowing it's her sister's dream school. On one hand, the author is being honest about her feelings and the opportunity Cornell represents. On the other hand, she's causing emotional distress to her sister, who's already feeling defeated. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? The admissions process is subjective, and the sister's choice of college (engineering vs. arts) might have influenced the outcome. The author isn't trying to undermine her sister; she's just trying to follow her own path. However, choosing to go to Cornell might prioritize her own desires over her sister's well-being. But then again, isn't it also important for the author to pursue her own opportunities? \n\nThe sister's reaction seems extreme, but the author is close to her and wants to support her. However, the author can't control the sister's feelings. The author is in a tough spot because she's being honest about her own dreams but is also considering the impact on her sister. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not intentionally trying to hurt her sister. She wants to go to Cornell because it's a significant opportunity, and she's aware of her sister's feelings but also her own. The fact that the sister is upset is unfortunate, but the author isn't in the wrong for pursuing her own education. The sister's emotional state is more about her own disappointment than the author's actions. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to balance her own aspirations with her sister's feelings, and the decision is ultimately her to make based on her own values and desires.\n"
