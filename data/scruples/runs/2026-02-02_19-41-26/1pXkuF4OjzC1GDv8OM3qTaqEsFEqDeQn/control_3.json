Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister was rejected. First, I need to understand the situation. The sister is a twin, and she's more accomplished with higher test scores and better extracurriculars. She applied to Cornell's engineering school, didn't get in, and is really upset. The author got into the Arts and Sciences program. They were supposed to go to school together, but now the sister is considering NYU and is depressed. The author is torn between going to Cornell and not wanting to hurt her sister.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness, the sister's feelings, and personal opportunity. The author feels guilty because she thinks she doesn't deserve to be there compared to her sister. But the question is whether she's actually in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the admissions process isn't entirely about stats; colleges look at different factors for different programs. The author applied to a different college within Cornell, which might have different criteria. So maybe it's not a direct comparison. Also, the sister's emotional state is a big concern. The author is worried about hurting her by attending Cornell, which was the sister's dream school. \n\nHowever, the author is also being honest about her own desires. The sister's depression might be more about her own rejection and the pressure she's under rather than the author's acceptance. The author hasn't told their parents yet, which adds a layer of secrecy. But is it fair to sacrifice her own opportunity? The sister is choosing NYU, but still seems unhappy. The author's presence at Cornell might have been a comfort, but the sister might still struggle regardless. \n\nThe author's actions aren't malicious. She's not keeping the secret to harm her sister but because she's conflicted. The decision is between her personal goals and her sister's feelings. Since the sister is already considering another school, maybe the author isn't the one causing the problem. The key is whether the author is intentionally hurting her sister. If the author is being honest and tries to support her sister, even if she goes to Cornell, she's not in the wrong. The responsibility isn't entirely on her. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
