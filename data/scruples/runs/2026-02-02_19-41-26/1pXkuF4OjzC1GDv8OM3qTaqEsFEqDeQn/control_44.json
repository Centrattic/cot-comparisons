Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister, who they believe is more qualified, got rejected. \n\nFirst, the author got into Cornell, which is her sister's dream school. The sister is extremely upset and applying to NYU instead. The author is conflicted because they were supposed to go to school together, and the sister might be devastated.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's decision to accept the offer despite knowing how it affects her sister. The sister's emotional state is a big factor. The author hasn't told their parents yet, which might be part of the guilt. The author is also feeling like they don't deserve the acceptance due to their lower stats.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author isn't doing anything wrong by accepting a school they were admitted to. It's their right to pursue their education. However, the sister's well-being is a concern. The author is aware of the sister's feelings and the impact their decision could have. The question is whether the author is being selfish by prioritizing their own desires over their sister's happiness.\n\nBut is it actually in the wrong? The author is not preventing the sister from attending another school. The sister is choosing NYU, even if it's not her first choice. The author's decision, while hurtful, isn't unethical. People can't control others' feelings or admit themselves to schools. The author is also taking the sister's feelings into account by not telling the parents yet and feeling conflicted. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to attend a school they were accepted to, even if it upsets their sister. The sister's disappointment is unfortunate, but the author isn't morally obligated to forgo their opportunity. The real issue might be how to support the sister emotionally, not whether the author is in the wrong.\n"
