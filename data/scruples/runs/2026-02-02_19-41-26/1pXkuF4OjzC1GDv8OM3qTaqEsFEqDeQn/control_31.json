Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a sister who got into her twin's dream school, Cornell, while the twin who worked harder didn't. The sister is now upset, and the author is conflicted about whether to go.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author feels like she doesn't deserve to get in because her stats are lower than her sister's. Her sister has higher ACT, better grades, and more extracurriculars. The sister applied to engineering at Cornell, which might have different criteria, but she still didn't get in. The author is worried about going to Cornell because it's her sister's dream school and she might be devastated. The author is considering going to NYU with her sister but is torn because she really wants Cornell.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by choosing Cornell over her sister's feelings. \n\nI think about the concept of \"AITA.\" The author is struggling with her own desires versus her sister's feelings. She's not trying to hurt her sister; in fact, she's aware of the impact. The sister's rejection is a separate issue, and the author's admission might be a surprise to the sister. The author is also considering her own happiness and the unique opportunity Cornell offers. \n\nIs it wrong to pursue your own dreams even if it upsets someone else? The sister should be upset, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The sister's application outcome is beyond the author's control. The author isn't taking the spot away; the admissions are separate. The sister might need to process her own disappointment, but the author's decision to go to her accepted school isn't unethical. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to support her sister and hasn't told the parents yet because they assumed she didn't get in. The author is being considerate but also has legitimate personal motivations. The sister might need to adjust her expectations, but the author isn't at fault for her own success. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go to Cornell, even though it might hurt her sister. It's a personal choice and the admissions process is independent.\n"
