Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully. The author is a twin sister who got into Cornell, which was her sister's dream school. The sister, who is considered the smarter one with better stats, didn't get into any Ivy League school, including Cornell. The author feels guilty about going to Cornell because it's the sister's dream school and she's been really upset about not getting in. They were supposed to go to school together, but the author is now considering going to Cornell, even though it might devastate her sister.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. She feels like she got into Cornell by a fluke, with lower stats and by applying to a different college within Cornell. She's worried about hurting her sister's feelings and their plan to go to school together. But she also really wants to go to Cornell because it's a dream opportunity for her, and she might regret it if she doesn't. \n\nOn the sister's side, she's been working harder, has better scores, and is now really down, even crying. The sister chose NYU, but the author is concerned she's not herself. The author is also keeping this from their parents, which might add to the guilt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to go to Cornell. The main factors here are the sister's feelings and the author's own wishes. The sister's dream school is Cornell, and the author is going there, which might make the sister feel like her efforts weren't recognized. But the author also has her own aspirations and might be giving up a once-in-a-lifetime chance.\n\nI think it's a tough situation. The author is in a bind between her own desires and her sister's well-being. However, the author isn't obligated to give up her opportunity just because it's her sister's dream school. Everyone has their own path, and the sister's rejection from Cornell isn't the author's fault. The author isn't in the wrong for accepting her offer. But maybe she should communicate more with her sister to see if there's a way to support each other without sacrificing their own opportunities. The sister might need emotional support more than the author going to the same school. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n"
