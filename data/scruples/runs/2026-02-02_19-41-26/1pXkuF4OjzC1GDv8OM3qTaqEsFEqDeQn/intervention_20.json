Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister, who's more accomplished, didn't get in. The sister is really upset, and they were supposed to go to school together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels her acceptance was a fluke, while her sister worked harder and was more qualified. The sister is struggling with the rejection and is considering NYU. The author is torn between her own desire to attend Cornell and the fear of hurting her sister.\n\nI think the key points are about the author's intentions and actions. The author is not intentionally trying to hurt her sister; she's conflicted. The sister's emotional state is a big factor. The author is trying to console her, but the situation is tough. The author might feel guilty, but is it her fault? The sister's college choice is her own decision, even if she's sad. The author's decision to go to Cornell isn't necessarily wrong because she was accepted. However, the sister's feelings are valid, and the author might need to consider how to support her sister while following her own path. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is not forcing her sister's choices and is trying to be considerate, maybe she's not in the wrong. The sister's reaction is more about her own disappointment than the author's acceptance. The author isn't to blame for the sister's rejection. So the answer might be B (No). But I need to be careful. The sister might feel the author's success adds to her pain, but that doesn't make the author wrong. It's a complex situation with no clear right or wrong, but the author's intentions are good. She's not in the wrong for going to a school she was accepted to. So B seems right.\n"
