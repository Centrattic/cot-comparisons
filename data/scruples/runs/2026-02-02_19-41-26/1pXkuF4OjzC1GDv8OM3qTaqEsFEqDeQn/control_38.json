Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is a twin sister who got into Cornell while her smarter sister didn't. The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted about going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author feels like she didn't deserve to get in, thinking it's a fluke. Her sister, who's more qualified, was rejected and is depressed. The author is considering whether she should go to Cornell or follow her sister to NYU to support her. The main question is if choosing to go to Cornell is wrong, given their sibling relationship and the sister's feelings.\n\nThe author hasn't told their parents yet, and the sister is already angry at friends who got into lower-tier schools. The sister chose NYU as a Plan B. The author is worried about being a bad sister by going to Cornell, which was her sister's dream school. But she also feels this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is the author wrong? Well, she's not trying to undermine her sister. She's conflicted and feels guilty. The sister's issue is that she didn't get into her top choice, but the author is facing her own decision. The sister is already going to NYU, which is a good school, but the author is being blamed for her sister's distress. But the root of the sister's sadness is her own rejection, not the author's acceptance. \n\nThe author is facing pressure from her sister's feelings. But the sister's choice to go to NYU suggests she's moving on. Maybe the author should support her sister's healing while also taking her chance. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go to a school she was accepted to, even if it's her sister's dream. The sister needs to process her own rejection, and the author shouldn't sacrifice her future because of that. \n\nAlso, the author's hesitation is understandable. She's aware of her sister's strong feelings but also her own desire. The sister might need time to adjust, but the author's decision to go to Cornell isn't the cause of the sister's sadness; her own rejection is. The author's choice is personal and based on her own opportunities. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
