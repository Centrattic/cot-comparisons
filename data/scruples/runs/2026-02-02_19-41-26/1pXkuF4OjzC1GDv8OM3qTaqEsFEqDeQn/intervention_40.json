Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her twin sister, who they consider smarter and more accomplished, was rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author got into Cornell, which is their sister's dream school, but she didn't. The sister is devastated and the author is conflicted because they want to go but don't want to hurt their sister. The author is considering not going to NYC with her, even though they had planned to go together. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the sister's emotional state and the author's self-interest versus her sister's well-being. The author is caught between her own desires and her sister's feelings. \n\nThe author might feel selfish for wanting to go to Cornell, especially since her sister didn't get in. However, is it ethical for the author to give up her opportunity just because her sister is upset? The sister's sadness is a result of her own rejection, not the author's acceptance. The author's acceptance doesn't take away from the sister's chances; each has their own application. \n\nBut the sister's depression and the bond between the twins might make the author feel responsible. However, the author's happiness and future are also important. The sister's decision to go to NYU is her choice, even if she's not happy. The author's presence might not necessarily fix her sister's situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't directly at fault for getting in. The admissions process is subjective. The sister's reaction is valid, but the author's decision to follow her own path isn't inherently wrong. It's a personal choice between their own aspirations and their sister's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the author is making a personal decision for her future, and while she should support her sister, she isn't obligated to sacrifice her own opportunity.\n"
