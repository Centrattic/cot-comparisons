Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell while their twin sister, who they consider more deserving, was rejected. \n\nFirst, the author got into Cornell, which is an Ivy League school. They mention their sister has a higher ACT score (34 vs. their 28), better grades, and more impressive extracurriculars. The sister applied to engineering at Cornell, and the author thinks the different admission criteria for the colleges within Cornell might be a reason they got in while she didn't. The sister is now really upset, even angry at friends who got into top schools. The author is considering going to Cornell but is worried about their sister's feelings.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault for attending their sister's dream school, especially since the sister might be more qualified. The author's dilemma is about their own desire to attend versus the sister's emotional well-being. \n\nI should consider if the author is being selfish by going. They did get accepted, so they aren't necessarily wrong for attending a school they were admitted to. However, the sister's emotional state is a valid concern. The author is conflicted and hasn't told their parents yet, which adds to the stress. \n\nBut the author isn't stopping the sister from attending NYU, they just might not be there with her. The sister's decision to go to NYU is her own, even if it's not her first choice. The author is going through their own excitement and fear of regret. \n\nCornell's different colleges have different criteria, so maybe the author's application to Arts and Sciences was more competitive than the sister's in engineering. That could be a legitimate reason. The author is also trying to support their sister, even though they feel guilty. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are not preventing the sister from going to her chosen school, just not being there with her. The author's acceptance isn't their fault. They are struggling with their own feelings and the sister's, but ultimately, they have the right to attend a school they were accepted to. The sister's choice to go to NYU is her own, and the author can support her without sacrificing their own opportunity. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for accepting their offer, even if it upsets their sister. They should focus on supporting their sister and maybe help her adjust to her own decisions.\n"
