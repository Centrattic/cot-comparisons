Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a twin sister who's very upset about not getting into her dream school, Cornell, while the author did get in, even though they feel they don't deserve it. The author is conflicted about attending because it would hurt her sister and their original plan to go to school together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The key points are: the sister's emotional state, the fairness of the admissions, the author's intentions, and the sister's well-being. The author feels they got in through a fluke and that their sister worked harder. But the sister is devastated, which is causing the author to question their decision.\n\nThe main ethical question is whether attending Cornell, despite the sister's feelings, is selfish. The sister's disappointment is significant, but the author also has their own dreams to consider. However, the sister's mental health is a big concern. The author is worried about causing her more harm by going. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Well, they didn't do anything to sabotage their sister. Admissions are subjective, and it's possible the author's application aligned better with their specific college's criteria. The sister's decision to attend NYU is her choice, but she's still struggling. The author is trying to balance their own desires with their sister's well-being. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault for being admitted. However, they need to consider how to support their sister. Maybe they can find ways to stay connected even if they go to different schools. The author isn't wrong for wanting to attend, but they should be empathetic and considerate. The key here is that the author isn't actively harming their sister; instead, they're facing a tough situation where their success inadvertently affects their sister. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
