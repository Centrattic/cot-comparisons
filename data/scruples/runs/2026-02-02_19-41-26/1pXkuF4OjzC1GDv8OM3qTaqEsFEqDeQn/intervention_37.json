Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a twin sister getting into Cornell, which was her sister's dream school, while the other sister, who's considered smarter, was rejected. The author is feeling conflicted about attending Cornell because their sister is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author attributes their acceptance to a fluke and feels they don't deserve it compared to their sister's impressive stats. The sister applied to engineering at Cornell, which might have different admission criteria, and didn't get in. Now, the author is wondering if they should go to Cornell, which would mean not going to school with their sister who is moving to NYU. \n\nThe author is concerned about being selfish and causing their sister more pain. They mention that their sister has been crying and is depressed, and that she's angry at friends who got into lower-tier schools. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to go to Cornell despite knowing it would hurt their sister.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a valid opportunity and might regret not taking it. On the other, their sister is struggling, and the author's decision could add to her distress. However, the author isn't preventing their sister from being happy; they're just pursuing their own dream. The sister's choice to go to NYU is her own decision, even if she's sad about not getting into Cornell. The author can't control their sister's feelings, but they can support her emotionally.\n\nIs it fair to say the author is in the wrong? Maybe not. They didn't intentionally cause harm, and their own success shouldn't be contingent on their sister's. The sister's disappointment is more about her own situation than the author's acceptance. The author might be feeling guilty for an outcome they can't control. The real issue is the sister's emotional state, which might need more support rather than the author sacrificing their own opportunity.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to pursue their education, and the sister's reaction is more about her own rejection. The author can still be a supportive sister without attending the same school. But I need to make sure there's no hidden aspect where the author is actively hurting their sister. It seems like it's more about the sister's feelings than the author's actions. The author's acceptance isn't a direct cause of their sister's rejection; different colleges within the same university have different criteria. The author isn't to blame for that.\n"
