Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where they got into their sister's dream school after she was rejected. The author is a twin, and their sister is more accomplished academically. The author feels guilty about going to Cornell when the sister wanted it so much but didn't get in. They're considering if they should go with her to NYU instead.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's sister is upset because she didn't get into any Ivy League schools, including Cornell, which was her first choice. The author got into Cornell, possibly because they applied to Arts and Sciences instead of engineering, which the sister did. The author is now conflicted between attending their own acceptance and staying with the sister, who might be more devastated if they go to Cornell instead of NYU with her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is that accurate? Well, the author didn't intentionally try to undermine their sister. They were genuinely surprised to get in and are now trying to figure out the right choice. The sister's main issue is her own rejection, not necessarily that her sister got in. The author is considering their own future and the opportunity at Cornell, which they couldn't imagine getting. However, they also want to support their sister, which is understandable.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to attend Cornell. The sister's sadness stems from her own rejection and the possibility of not going to school with her twin. The author's decision to go to Cornell might be seen as selfish if they ignore their sister's feelings, but on the other hand, they are making a personal choice about their education. The sister's depression might be more about her own situation rather than the author's acceptance. The author is trying to balance their own aspirations with family support.\n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't do anything to prevent their sister from getting into Cornell. The admissions process is beyond their control. The sister's application was to engineering, which might be more competitive. The author is now faced with an emotional dilemma. Choosing Cornell is a personal decision, and while it's important to be considerate, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to take the opportunity. The sister's reaction is about her own feelings of rejection, not the author's acceptance. The author might need to communicate their feelings and support their sister in other ways, but the decision to attend is their own. So the answer is B.\n"
