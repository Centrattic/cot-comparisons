Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting into Cornell while their twin sister didn't, and whether they should go to Cornell instead of going with her to NYU.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author and their sister applied to different colleges within Cornell. The sister applied to engineering, which might have different admission criteria. The author got in, while the sister didn't. The sister is upset, and the author is conflicted about attending because they don't want to hurt their sister's feelings, but they also really want to go to Cornell.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and the sister's emotional state. The author is questioning their own selfishness. But is it really their fault that they got into the school? The admissions process is complex, and different colleges have different standards. Just because the sister is more accomplished doesn't mean she wasn't rejected for reasons beyond her control. The author isn't to blame for the sister's rejection; that's the university's decision.\n\nAlso, the author isn't doing anything wrong by choosing to attend a school they were accepted to. They can't control their sister's feelings, even if they know it might upset her. The responsibility lies more with the sister to manage her emotions and maybe accept that the author's acceptance isn't a reflection on her. The author is in a tough spot, trying to balance their own desires with their sister's feelings, but they aren't in the wrong for following their own path. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
