Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, the \"dumb sister,\" got into Cornell while her twin sister, who's considered the genius with better stats, didn't get in. The sister is really upset, and the author is torn between going to Cornell or joining her sister at NYU.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the sister's feelings versus the author's own desires. The author is considering going to Cornell even though the sister is devastated. They were supposed to go to school together, but the sister is now choosing NYU instead. The author is worried about being selfish.\n\nSo, is it wrong to prioritize her own opportunity? Well, getting into a top school like Cornell is a big deal, and the author might feel it's a once-in-a-lifetime chance. The sister's rejection is a separate issue. The author is trying to support her sister but is also facing her own aspirations. The sister's decision to go to NYU might not be influenced by the author's choice if the author goes to Cornell. However, the sister is already upset, and the author's decision could add to that.\n\nBut the author is also feeling conflicted. They want to go to Cornell because they really want it and feel it's a dream. The sister's reaction would be hurt, but does that make the author wrong? Maybe not. The author isn't doing anything to prevent the sister from going to NYU. The sister's choice is her own, even if she's depressed. The author's admission might not be the direct cause of the sister's sadness; the sister's own rejection is the main issue. The author is just facing their own opportunity.\n\nAlso, the author is considering not telling the parents, which might be a separate issue. But the main question is about being a bad sister. The author is in a tough spot. Wanting to attend a school they were accepted to isn't inherently wrong. The sister's feelings are valid, but the author isn't obligated to sacrifice their own future to make the sister feel better. It's about balancing their own needs with their sister's emotions.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. They are facing a personal achievement and want to pursue it, even if it makes their sister sad. The sister's reaction is unfortunate, but it's not the author's fault they got in while the sister didn't. The author is trying to support her sister but also has her own dreams to consider. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
