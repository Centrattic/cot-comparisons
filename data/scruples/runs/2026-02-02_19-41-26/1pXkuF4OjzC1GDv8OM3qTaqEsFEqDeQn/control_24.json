Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting into Cornell, her sister's dream school, while the sister was rejected. The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted about going because they were supposed to go to school together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author feels undeserving because her stats aren't as strong as her sister's. Her sister has better grades, higher ACT, and more impressive extracurriculars. The author got in maybe because she applied to a different college within Cornell. The sister is depressed and angry, and the author is considering going to Cornell even though it might hurt her sister. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to go to Cornell despite her sister's feelings.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The author is in a situation where her personal opportunity might cause emotional harm to her sister. But is she in the wrong? Well, the author isn't doing anything illegal or necessarily unethical. The sister's feelings are important, but the author also has her own dreams. However, the author is aware that going to Cornell would devastate her sister. The sister was already struggling with her own rejections, and the author's acceptance might add to her pain.\n\nBut the author is also considering her own happiness and the unique opportunity. Maybe the sister would understand if the author explains her feelings. The author hasn't told the parents yet, so there's some secrecy involved. The sister's mental health is a concern here. The author needs to weigh her own desires against her sister's well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't doing something morally wrong by accepting the offer, but she might be insensitive to her sister's feelings. However, the sister's issues might be more about her own rejections than the author's acceptance. The author is trying to console her sister, but the sister is still upset. The author's decision isn't necessarily wrong, but she should handle it with care and maybe find a way to support her sister while pursuing her own path.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author made a genuine effort to support her sister and is now facing a tough decision where her own opportunity isn't automatically wrong. The sister's reaction is more about her own feelings towards the rejection, not just the author's acceptance. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice her own chance just because her sister is upset. However, she should be empathetic and maybe find a way to ease her sister's pain, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong for wanting to go to Cornell.\n"
