Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for going to Cornell when their sister, who's more accomplished, didn't get in. The sister was rejected from all Ivy schools, including Cornell, which was her first choice. The author got in, possibly due to applying to a different college within Cornell. The sister is really upset, and they're considering whether to go to Cornell or join her in NYC.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is that their sister is devastated and they were supposed to go to school together. The author is conflicted between their own desire to attend their dream school and not wanting to hurt their sister. The key points here are the emotional impact on the sister versus the author's own aspirations.\n\nThe sister's achievements are higher, which makes the situation seem unfair. But the author's admission might be due to different application criteria (Arts vs. Engineering). However, the sister's emotional state is crucial. The author is worried about making her feel even worse. But is the author actually in the wrong if they choose to go to Cornell? \n\nThe author isn't forcing the sister to go to NYU; it's her own decision. The author is considering going to Cornell, which is a personal choice. While it might hurt the sister, the author isn't responsible for the sister's depression resulting from her own rejections. The author's success might be a result of different factors (like different admission criteria), so it's not entirely their fault. The real issue is the sister's emotional response. The author is trying to balance their own happiness with supporting their sister, but ultimately, they can't control how their sister feels. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing their own opportunity, even if their sister is upset. The sister's feelings are valid, but the author isn't at fault for getting into the school. They can still support their sister in other ways without attending the same school. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
