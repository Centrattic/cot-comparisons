Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting into Cornell University, which was her twin sister's dream school, while the sister was rejected from all Ivy Leagues and is now very upset. The author is conflicted about attending Cornell because of her sister's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The sister is described as more academically accomplished\u2014higher ACT score, better grades, and extracurriculars. The author feels like she got in by a fluke and is worried about making her sister feel worse by attending the same school she was rejected from. The sister is planning to go to NYU, but is depressed and angry at friends who got into lower-tier schools. The author is considering not attending Cornell to make her sister feel better, but she's also excited about the opportunity.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by wanting to go to Cornell despite her sister's feelings. Let's break this down.\n\n1. **Admissions Process Fairness**: College admissions are competitive and based on various factors beyond just stats. Each college (like different schools within Cornell) has its own criteria. The author's sister applied to Engineering, which might be more competitive. So, it's not necessarily unfair that the author got in while her sister didn't, even if the sister has better stats in general.\n\n2. **Emotional Impact**: The sister is already struggling with her rejection. The author's decision to attend the school could exacerbate her feelings of inadequacy or unfairness. However, the author is also entitled to her own aspirations. But is it wrong to prioritize her own happiness when it might hurt her sister?\n\n3. **Responsibility and Empathy**: The author is aware that attending might hurt her sister and is conflicted. They were supposed to go to school together, but now that plan is out. The author is considering alternatives, like going with her sister to NYC, but has reservations about NYU. The sister's mental health is a concern here. Should the author sacrifice her own opportunity to protect her sister's feelings?\n\n4. **Comparison and Self-Worth**: The author feels she doesn't deserve the acceptance, which might be an issue of self-esteem. The sister's identity as the \"smart\" twin adds pressure. The author's decision could influence their dynamic. But is that the sister's problem to resolve, or does the author have a role in mitigating the sister's pain?\n\n5. **Communication and Support**: The author hasn't told their parents yet, possibly hiding the acceptance. The sister is already upset, and the author's decision could affect their family dynamics. The author's intention to console her sister suggests she cares, but the decision to attend might feel dismissive to the sister.\n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, the AITA framework often considers intent and impact. The author didn't intentionally make her sister feel worse, but her decision might have that effect. However, the author is also pursuing her own opportunity, which she might genuinely want. The sister's mental health is a significant factor here. If the author proceeds, it could make her sister feel even more defeated, which is harmful. On the other hand, the author's own happiness and educational goals are valid.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The sister's issues with comparing schools and feeling depressed might stem from her own expectations and how she's internalizing the rejections. The author's decision isn't the root cause, but it could be a trigger. The author could be seen as not fully considering the emotional impact, but she's conflicted and trying to balance her own desires with her sister's feelings. However, since the sister is already in a vulnerable state, proceeding with the decision could be seen as adding to her distress, making the author complicit in a way, even if unintentionally. \n\nAlternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because she's not obligated to sacrifice her own opportunities for her sister. The sister's reaction is a result of her own circumstances, not the author's actions. The author is trying to navigate her own success while being empathetic, which is commendable. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for choosing to go to Cornell despite the sister's feelings. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action is harmful and if the person is aware and still proceeds. The author is aware and conflicted but still wants to go. If she proceeds, it might be seen as selfish, but if she chooses to go with her sister to NYC, that shows consideration. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author's actions aren't malicious, and the sister's reaction is more about her own struggles rather than the author's fault. However, the author could be advised to have a conversation with her sister to understand if her attending would be hurtful and find a way to support each other, but that doesn't necessarily make her in the wrong.\n"
