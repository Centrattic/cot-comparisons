Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting into Cornell while her twin sister, who's perceived as smarter and more accomplished, got rejected. The sister is really upset, and the author is torn between going to Cornell or joining her sister at NYU.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author feels she didn't deserve to get in, citing lower stats and that her sister is more qualified. The sister applied to engineering at Cornell, which might have different admission criteria. The author is worried about hurting her sister's feelings but also wants to go to Cornell because it's a dream school for her.\n\nNow, considering the question of whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are the sister's emotional state and the author's intentions. The author is conflicted but hasn't told her sister yet. She's considering the sister's feelings and has resolved to console her. However, she's also considering her own future and the opportunity Cornell presents.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to accept an offer from a school you got into, even if it upsets a sibling? The author isn't doing anything unethical by attending; the issue is more about the emotional impact on her sister. The sister's choice to attend NYU is her own, but the author feels the decision might crush her. However, the sister has made her own choice, even if she's sad. The author's dilemma is about prioritizing her own opportunity versus her sister's feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't at fault for getting accepted. Admissions can be subjective, and different colleges have different criteria. The sister's sadness is more about her own disappointment rather than the author's actions. The author is trying to balance her own aspirations with her relationship with her sister. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to attend a school she was accepted to. The answer probably leans towards B (No).\n"
