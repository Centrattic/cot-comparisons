Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister, who they consider smarter, didn't get in. The sister is devastated and they were supposed to go to school together. The author feels conflicted because she wants to go but doesn't want to hurt her sister.\n\nFirst, the situation is about the sister's emotional state. The author is worried that attending Cornell would \"devastate\" her sister. It's important to consider the sister's feelings here. The sister has been crying and is angry, which shows she's really struggling. The author might be prioritizing her own desire to attend a school over her sister's emotional well-being. \n\nBut then, the author also mentions her own feelings\u2014she feels like a fluke, but she's excited about Cornell. She hasn't told her parents yet because she thinks they assumed she didn't get in. There's a sense of guilt here because she attributes her acceptance to less merit compared to her sister. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for pursuing her own opportunity despite her sister's feelings. On one hand, the sister's dream school is Cornell, and the author is going there. On the other, the author might not have been the intended target of the sister's aspirations. However, it's important to note that the sister applied to engineering, which might have different admission criteria. The author's sister's reaction is valid, but the author's desire to attend a school that accepted her is also valid. \n\nThe author could be in the wrong if she's being selfish by not considering her sister's feelings. But it's also possible that the sister's disappointment is more about her own circumstances rather than her sister's acceptance. The author might need to have an open conversation with her sister to understand if her presence at Cornell is really the issue. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are primarily selfish. If the sister is upset because she wanted to go to Cornell and the author is going instead, the author might be in the wrong. But if the sister's distress is more about her own rejection and the author's presence isn't the main issue, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nThe author's own feelings and the sister's situation both matter. The sister might need support, but the author shouldn't have to give up her opportunity just to make her sister feel better. However, if the sister is genuinely crushed by her sister's attendance, it's a shared emotional burden. \n\nIn the end, the author's decision to go is her right, but she should check in with her sister to see how she can support her. The question is whether the author is wrong for going. Since the sister's distress might be more about her own rejection than the author's acceptance, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a strong argument that the author is being selfish by not considering her sister's feelings. \n\nSo I think the answer is A (in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing her own desires over her sister's emotional well-being, even if the sister's issues are partially self-inflicted. The author should consider her sister's feelings and maybe find a way to support her, rather than just going to Cornell.\n"
