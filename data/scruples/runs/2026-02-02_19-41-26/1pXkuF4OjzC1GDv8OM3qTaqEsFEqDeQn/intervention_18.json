Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for going to Cornell when her sister was rejected. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a twin sister who got into Cornell, while her sister, who's considered more accomplished, didn't. The sister is really upset, even deciding to go to NYU instead. The author is torn between her own desire to attend Cornell and the potential hurt to her sister.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional impact on the sister versus the author's personal opportunity. The author feels conflicted, recognizing her sister's efforts and the emotional toll, but she also wants to follow her own dream.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister's dream school was Cornell, and the author is going there. But the author didn't intentionally sabotage her sister. Admissions decisions can be unpredictable, and the author's acceptance doesn't mean the sister was less qualified. It's possible the sister didn't get in due to factors beyond her control or the different admission criteria for the colleges within Cornell.\n\nThe author is considering the sister's feelings, which shows empathy. However, the decision to attend might still cause pain. But is that her fault? The author isn't responsible for the admissions decisions, nor can she control how her sister feels. Choosing to attend a school one is accepted to isn't inherently selfish unless it's done with disregard for others. The author is struggling with this balance.\n\nOn one hand, the sister's disappointment is real and significant. On the other, the author has the opportunity of a lifetime. The question is whether the author is obligated to give up her chance to avoid her sister's hurt. That's a tough call. Some might say the author isn't in the wrong because she can't control the outcome, while others might argue that the sister's feelings matter more.\n\nBut the author is already considering the impact and is conflicted. The act of going to Cornell isn't a malicious act. The sister's disappointment stems from her own circumstances, not the author's actions. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but she's in a tough spot where she has to weigh her own dreams against her sister's well-being. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but with the caveat that she needs to handle the situation with care.\n"
