Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author getting into Cornell, which was her sister's dream school, after the sister was rejected. The sister is upset, and the author is conflicted about attending because they were supposed to go to school together.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author feels undeserving of the acceptance, attributing it to a fluke, while her sister is more qualified. The sister is devastated, and the author is considering whether to attend Cornell or go to NYU with her sister. The author is worried about hurting her sister's feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to attend Cornell. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider various angles. The author's feelings vs. the sister's emotional state. The sister's disappointment is significant, but does the author have a right to her own happiness? The sister was applying to engineering, which might have different criteria. Also, the author is conflicted and is thinking about the sister's feelings. \n\nThe author is not intentionally trying to hurt her sister. She's trying to weigh her own desires against her sister's well-being. The sister's depression is a concern, but is the author responsible for that? The sister's emotional state might be due to other factors as well, like general rejection from all Ivies. \n\nThe sister decided to go to NYU, but is unhappy. The author is considering sacrificing her own dream to support her sister. However, the author feels that attending Cornell is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. \n\nIn such cases, it's often a matter of personal choice and empathy. The author is not in the wrong if she makes a decision that prioritizes her own growth while still considering her sister's feelings. But if she is being selfish without regard for her sister's pain, that's different. However, she's trying to balance both, which complicates the issue.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being selfish. The sister's dream school is now in the author's hands. But the sister's own decision to go to NYU might be her way of moving on. The author might not be in the wrong because she's not forcing her sister to do anything. The sister's reaction is emotional, but the author can't be blamed for her own acceptance. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a personal choice, and it's not entirely her fault. She's even considering the sister's feelings and is conflicted, which shows she's not being inconsiderate.\n"
