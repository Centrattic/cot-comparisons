Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to attend Cornell when their sister, who they consider more deserving, was rejected.\n\nFirst, the author got into Cornell, which is their sister's dream school. The sister is extremely upset and had better stats. The author is conflicted because they don't want to hurt their sister but also really want to go to Cornell.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's emotional state and the author's intent. The author is considering going to Cornell despite knowing it might devastate their sister. They also mention they were supposed to go to school together. However, the author is questioning their own worthiness due to their lower stats compared to their sister.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Everyone has the right to pursue their own opportunities, even if it's painful for someone else. The sister's rejection is a separate issue, and the author's admission doesn't negate that. However, the author should be sensitive to their sister's feelings and explore ways to support her, maybe by visiting or staying in touch. \n\nThe decision to attend Cornell is personal. The author isn't obligated to sacrifice their chances for their sister's benefit, especially if they genuinely feel it's the right choice for them. The sister's emotional reaction is tragic, but the author isn't responsible for her rejection. They can still be supportive while pursuing their own path. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to go to Cornell. They need to balance their own aspirations with empathy towards their sister, but they aren't morally obligated to give up the opportunity.\n"
