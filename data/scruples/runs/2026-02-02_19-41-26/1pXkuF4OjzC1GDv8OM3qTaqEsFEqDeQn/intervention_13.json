Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got into Cornell, which was their twin sister's dream school. The sister, who has better stats, got rejected and is really upset. The author is considering whether to go to Cornell or stay with the sister at NYU.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels guilty because they think their sister worked harder and deserved Cornell more. The sister is depressed and it was her dream school. But the author also feels they don't want to miss out on Cornell because it's a good opportunity. \n\nThe author is a twin, so they probably have a close relationship. The sister's emotional state is a big factor here. The author is worried about hurting her by going to Cornell. But they also have their own aspirations. \n\nIs it selfish to pursue one's own opportunity, even if it upsets a sibling? On one hand, the author got accepted, so it's their right to go. On the other hand, the sister's disappointment is significant. However, the author isn't preventing the sister from attending other schools. They're just choosing their own path. \n\nThe sister's depression is a serious issue. But the author can't be responsible for her mental health entirely. The sister might need support regardless of the author's decision. The author is trying to balance their own happiness with their sister's well-being. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything wrong by accepting their admission. The question is whether they are \"in the wrong\" for choosing their own path. Society often expects people to prioritize family, but individuals also have the right to their own choices. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't denying the sister the chance to go to Cornell; the sister didn't get in. The author's attendance at Cornell doesn't affect the sister's opportunities beyond emotional impact. So while it's a tough situation, the author isn't in the wrong for going. They should support their sister but also have the right to attend their accepted school.\n"
