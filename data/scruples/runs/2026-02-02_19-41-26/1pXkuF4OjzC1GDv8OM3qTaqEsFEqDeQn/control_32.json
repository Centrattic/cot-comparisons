Honestly I think it was fluke. I\u2019m not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...\n\nMy twin sister is the opposite of me. She\u2019s a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn\u2019t and still don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn\u2019t is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don\u2019t know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). \n\nWell last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn\u2019t get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. \n\nWell anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn\u2019t even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I\u2019m a Cornellian. I got in. I just don\u2019t know how but I did. \n\nI really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she\u2019s been crying and solemn and sad. She\u2019s been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She\u2019s decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn\u2019t been herself. I haven\u2019t told our parents (I think they assumed I didn\u2019t get in because she didn\u2019t). \n\nAm I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it\u2019s Cornell. I couldn\u2019t in a million years imagine I\u2019d get in. I\u2019ve been researching obsessively about it and I can\u2019t shake the desire that if I don\u2019t go, I\u2019ll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it\u2019s a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. \n\nAm I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don\u2019t have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she\u2019s worked compared to me...\n\nTLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn\u2019t. She\u2019s depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is a twin sister, got into Cornell while her smarter and more accomplished sister didn't. The sister is really upset, and the author is conflicted about whether to go to Cornell or join her sister at NYU.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author feels guilty because she got into her sister's dream school, even though she thinks it was a fluke. She acknowledges that her sister has better credentials and that the sister applied to a different college (engineering) which might have different admission criteria. The sister is clearly distressed, and the author is worried about hurting her further by attending Cornell.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's intentions and the impact of her decision. The author hasn't told their parents yet, and she's considering going to Cornell because it's an opportunity she never thought she'd get. But she's also aware that it would hurt her sister.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the author's decision isn't directly causing the sister's rejection (since the admissions are separate), she might feel that her attending the school could add to her sister's distress. However, the author is also entitled to her own happiness and opportunities. The sister's application outcomes are separate from the author's, so the author isn't at fault for getting in. The sister's emotional state is unfortunate, but the author isn't responsible for the admissions decisions. That said, the author is considering how her choice affects her sister, which shows empathy.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author should prioritize her own opportunity or her sister's feelings. Since both are valid, but the author isn't to blame for the situation, the answer would likely be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to attend the school she was accepted to, even if it's her sister's dream school. The sister's reaction is a result of her own application outcome, not the author's actions. The author can still try to support her sister while making her own choice.\n"
