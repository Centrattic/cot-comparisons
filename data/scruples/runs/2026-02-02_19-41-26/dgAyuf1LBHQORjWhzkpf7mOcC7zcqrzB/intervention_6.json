I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a hair coloring issue. The user showed a picture of the desired color and specified a light brown rose gold. The result was more red than brown. The author is arguing that they don't have to pay for the fix because it's not what they asked for, even though they showed the picture in advance.\n\nFirst, the author did take steps to communicate their request\u2014showing the image a week in advance and emphasizing the color. The stylist had time to prepare. The result didn't meet expectations, with more red than brown. The author is saying they shouldn't pay for the fix since it's not what they wanted.\n\nBut, hair coloring can be tricky. Even with reference images, there's a lot that can go wrong. The stylist might have used the wrong color mix or the application could have been off. The author might be assuming that the stylist didn't listen, but maybe there were other factors. However, the author did specify multiple times, so maybe the stylist made a mistake.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the stylist failed to deliver what was agreed upon, the client might be within their rights to not pay for the fix. But salons often have policies where if you don't like the result, they'll fix it for free up to a point, but after that, you might have to pay. However, the initial service was paid for, so maybe the client is now asking for a free redo.\n\nBut the key points here are that the client communicated clearly, provided a reference, and the result was not what was requested. The stylist is offering to fix it, but the client is refusing to pay. Whether the client is in the wrong depends on the salon's policies and the expectations. If the color was significantly off and the client's communication was clear, maybe the salon is at fault. However, the client might be expecting a free fix without considering that the salon incurs costs for the redo.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the stylist didn't deliver as promised. However, sometimes clients are expected to pay for fixes if they require multiple attempts. But given the clear communication and the result being off, maybe the client isn't in the wrong. Wait, but if the salon agreed to fix it, maybe the client is unreasonably refusing payment. Hmm. This is tricky. Maybe the answer is B because the client isn't the one who messed up; the stylist did. So the client isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a standard expectation here. In many places, if a service is performed incorrectly, the business is responsible for the fix. So the client shouldn't have to pay again. So B (No).\n"
