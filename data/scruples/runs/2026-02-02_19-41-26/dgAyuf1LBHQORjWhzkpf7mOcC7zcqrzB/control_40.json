I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is about a hairdresser not doing what was asked. The person showed a picture of a light brown rose gold, but the result looks more red. They emphasized wanting a light brown, warm color, and even showed the image in advance. The hairdresser is fixing it, but the user thinks they shouldn't have to pay for the mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibility here. The client gave clear instructions: light brown, warm color, showed a reference picture a week ahead. They mentioned multiple times the preference for more brown than red. The hairdresser, despite that, did a color with more red tones. The client is upset because the result isn't what they wanted, and they don't want to pay for the fix.\n\nHair salons typically have policies where if they make a mistake, they should cover the cost. The client communicated clearly, so the hairdresser should've followed the instructions. The client isn't at fault here because they provided all necessary information. The hairdresser didn't meet the client's specifications, so the client isn't in the wrong to expect the fix at no cost. The answer should be B (No).\n"
