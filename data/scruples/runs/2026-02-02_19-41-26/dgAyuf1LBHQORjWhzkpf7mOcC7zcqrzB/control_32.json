I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a hairdresser not delivering the requested hair color as expected.\n\nFirst, the user showed a picture of the desired color, a light brown rose gold, and emphasized the need for a warm, light brown. They mentioned showing the image a week in advance. The result was much more red, which the user didn't want. The user is now saying they shouldn't have to pay for the fix.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The user communicated their request clearly, provided a reference, and even emphasized the color preference multiple times. The hairdresser might have misunderstood or miscalculated, but the user is within their rights to expect the service to meet their specifications, especially since they made it clear. It's common for clients to expect a redo or free fix if the service isn't as agreed upon. The hairdresser is responsible for the outcome here, so the user isn't in the wrong for not paying for the correction.\n"
