I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a hairdresser not doing the color they were asked for, and the person wants it fixed for free.\n\nFirst, the user showed the stylist a reference image a week in advance. They specified a light brown rose gold, which they emphasized was more brown than red. The result ended up with a lot of red tones, which the person didn't want. Their hair was originally bleach blonde, so maybe the stylist tried to adjust for that?\n\nThe user is arguing that they communicated clearly and gave enough time for the stylist to prepare. They don't want to pay for the fix because it's not what they asked for. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nWell, the stylist did agree to do the service and didn't mention any issues with the reference image. The customer provided clear instructions and the image as a guide. If the stylist didn't follow the instructions correctly, that's on them. The customer isn't obligated to pay for the mistake. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
