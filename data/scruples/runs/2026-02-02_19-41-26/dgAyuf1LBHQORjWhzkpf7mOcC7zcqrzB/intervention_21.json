I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a hair stylist not doing what the client asked for. The client showed a picture of a light brown rose gold color and emphasized wanting a light brown, warm color. The result was more red, which the client didn't want. They argue they shouldn't have to pay for the fix.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The client communicated their request clearly: showed a picture, mentioned the color multiple times. They wanted more brown than red and were okay without the rose tint. The stylist might have misunderstood or misjudged the color. But the client is refusing to pay for the fix.\n\nHair salons usually charge for fixes if their mistake. But sometimes, if the client didn't provide enough info, they might be expected to pay. The client did give a picture and repeated their preference. The stylist might be at fault here for not getting the color right. However, color matching isn't exact, so there's some room for error. But the client's emphasis on light brown vs. red suggests a clear direction. The stylist's version ended up being more red, which wasn't what was asked. \n\nThe client's stance is they shouldn't pay because the result wasn't what they wanted. But salons often have policies where if the mistake is on their end, they handle the fix. If the client didn't follow up after seeing the initial result, maybe they share some blame. However, the client did ask multiple times and showed the picture in advance. The stylist might be responsible here. \n\nSo, is the client in the wrong? The user thinks yes, but I need to evaluate. The client followed through with communication. The stylist didn't deliver as requested. The client's refusal to pay is about the stylist's error. If the stylist made a mistake, the client isn't in the wrong to ask for a free fix. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
