I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a hair stylist who messed up the color. The user showed a reference picture of a light brown rose gold and emphasized wanting a light brown, warm color. They mentioned showing the picture a week in advance and being clear multiple times. The result was more red than brown, which they didn't expect. They don't want to pay for a fix.\n\nFirst, the stylist had the reference image and was told several times about the desired color. The customer's hair was already bleached blonde, so maybe the stylist should have considered that the color would turn out differently. If the stylist didn't have the right toner or didn't apply it correctly, that's their mistake. The customer is asking for a free fix because the outcome wasn't what they agreed on. \n\nIs the customer in the wrong for not paying? Probably not. The stylist made an error despite clear communication. The customer isn't responsible for the mistake. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
