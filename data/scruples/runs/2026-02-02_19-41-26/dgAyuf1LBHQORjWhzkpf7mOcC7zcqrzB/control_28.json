I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted about their hair coloring is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user went to a stylist and showed a picture of the desired color. They mentioned wanting a light brown with rose gold, emphasizing more brown than red. The stylist ended up giving them something with more red tones. The user is upset because the result doesn't match what they asked for and they don't want to pay again for a fix.\n\nI need to consider if the user is at fault. Did they communicate clearly? They mentioned multiple times wanting light brown, brown warmer tones, and showed the picture in advance. The stylist might have misunderstood, maybe the lighting in the images or color perception could differ. The user's main issue is that the color is too red, which wasn't what they wanted. Since the stylist didn't match the description or the sample, the user's frustration is valid. The stylist should have listened and followed the instructions. Also, charging for a fix isn't fair since the error was on the stylist's end. So, the user isn't the asshole here.\n"
