I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a hair coloring mishap.\n\nThe user says they showed the stylist a picture of the desired color, a light brown rose gold. They emphasized wanting light brown, warm color, and mentioned they wanted more brown than red. The result was something different, and they don't want to pay for a fix.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both parties. The client clearly communicated their request multiple times and provided a reference. The stylist's job is to follow those instructions as closely as possible. Even if there's some difficulty in matching the exact color, the fact that the client specified \"light brown\" and wanted more brown than red suggests that the outcome might not meet those expectations. \n\nHair color can be tricky, especially with bleach blonde starting point. Maybe the stylist didn't have the right shades or made a mistake. But the key point is the communication. The client did their part by giving clear instructions and a sample. The stylist might have misinterpreted or chosen a different shade. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the stylist is expected to deliver what the client asked for. If the result is significantly off, it's reasonable for the client to expect it to be fixed without additional cost. The client isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They followed up, provided clear guidance, and the outcome wasn't what they wanted despite that. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there were extenuating circumstances. Perhaps the stylist tried their best, but the client's expectations were unrealistic. However, the client said they would accept the rose tint if the base was light brown. If the result is too red, that's a problem. The client's main issue is the color being more red than brown, which they explicitly avoided wanting. \n\nSo, considering all that, the client isn't in the wrong. The stylist should fix it for free since the client followed instructions and the result didn't meet the agreed-upon request. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
