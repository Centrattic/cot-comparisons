I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a hairdresser not matching the requested hair color, and the writer wants it fixed for free.\n\nFirst, the writer showed a picture of a light brown rose gold color. They emphasized wanting light brown, warm color, and mentioned wanting more brown than red. The hairdresser ended up giving a red tone instead. The writer argues that since they communicated clearly and even showed the picture in advance, the hairdresser should fix it at no cost.\n\nNow, considering the hairdresser's responsibility. They are professionals who should accurately interpret client requests. The client provided a visual reference and verbal instructions, so the hairdresser should have ensured the color was close to the sample. If the mismatch is due to the hairdresser's error, then they might be responsible for the fix. However, sometimes hair coloring is tricky, especially starting from bleach blonde. The hairdresser might have used a different technique or product that resulted in a different shade. But the client did communicate their preferences, so the hairdresser should take responsibility for not meeting those expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, the client's expectation might be unrealistic if the hairdresser can't perfectly match the image exactly, but the client was okay without the rose tint as long as it's more brown. The result was significantly off, so the hairdresser should correct it. Therefore, the client isn't in the wrong for wanting a free fix since the service didn't meet the agreed-upon outcome.\n"
