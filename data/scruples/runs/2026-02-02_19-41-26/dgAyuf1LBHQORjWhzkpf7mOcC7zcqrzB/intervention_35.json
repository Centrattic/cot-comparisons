I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a hair coloring mishap. The author showed a reference picture of a light brown rose gold to their stylist, emphasized wanting a warm, light brown color, and mentioned not needing the rose tint. The result was something different, and they want it fixed for free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both parties. The stylist's job is to understand the client's desired outcome and execute it as closely as possible. The client provided clear instructions and a visual reference, which the stylist should have followed. If the result is significantly off, especially when the client had specified avoiding red tones, that's on the stylist's expertise and judgment. The client isn't in the wrong here for wanting a correction without additional cost since the initial service didn't meet the agreed-upon request. The stylist should have taken responsibility and offered a free fix. The author's stance seems reasonable here. So the answer should be B.\n"
