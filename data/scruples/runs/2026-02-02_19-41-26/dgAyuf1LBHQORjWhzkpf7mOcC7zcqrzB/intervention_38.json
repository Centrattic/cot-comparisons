I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a hairdresser messing up a color. The author showed a picture of the desired color, specified it's light brown with rose gold, emphasized wanting more brown than red, and even mentioned they showed the stylist the picture a week in advance. The result was something redder than expected. The author is now saying they shouldn't have to pay for the fix.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both parties. As a client, the author communicated their request clearly multiple times and provided a reference image. The stylist, on the other hand, is supposed to understand the client's vision and deliver it. If the stylist didn't ask enough questions or didn't have the right products, that's on them. Also, if the client's hair was already bleach blonde, that's a starting point the stylist should account for. Maybe the stylist used a formula that didn't turn out as expected, but they should be the expert here.\n\nThe key points here are communication and professional responsibility. The client did their part by being clear and giving advance notice. The stylist is the professional who should handle the color correctly. If they messed up, it's not the client's fault. However, the client might need to be flexible if the fix requires additional steps, but in terms of not paying for the fix, the client has a valid point because the service wasn't as agreed. So the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
