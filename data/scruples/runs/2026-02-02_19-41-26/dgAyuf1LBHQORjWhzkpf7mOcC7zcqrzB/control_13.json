I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about a hair coloring gone wrong. The user showed a picture to their stylist, specified wanting light brown with a warm rose gold, but ended up with something that looks more red or pink. They argue they shouldn't have to pay for a fix.\n\nFirst, the client gave clear instructions: light brown, warm color, more brown than red. They also provided a reference image in advance. The stylist had time to prepare. The result was not what was requested. The client is asking for a free fix. \n\nFrom the client's side, they followed up multiple times, so it's reasonable they expect the stylist to listen. If the stylist made a mistake in color mixing or application, leading to an incorrect result, that's the stylist's fault. Typically, if a service provider doesn't meet the agreed-upon service, they should cover the cost of fixing it. \n\nThe client isn't demanding a refund beyond the correction. The key point is whether the stylist's error was the cause. Since the client provided all necessary info and the result was off, it's the stylist's responsibility. So the client isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
