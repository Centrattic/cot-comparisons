I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a hair coloring issue. The author wanted a light brown rose gold, but the result was more red. They showed the stylist a picture and emphasized the color multiple times.\n\nFirst, the author made their request clear: light brown, warm, more brown than red. They even showed a picture in advance. The stylist had time to prepare. The problem is that the result was not what was asked for. The author is now saying they shouldn't have to pay for the fix.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the stylist might argue that there's a standard fee for corrections, but the author is saying it's not their fault because they were clear. On the other hand, maybe the stylist tried their best and there were unforeseen issues, like the bleach blonde base affecting the color. But the author emphasized the color, so maybe the stylist should have gotten it right. \n\nIn some cases, salons might charge for corrections if it's due to client error, but here the client followed through with communication. The key point is whether the stylist's failure to meet the request justifies the client not paying. If the client clearly communicated and the stylist didn't deliver, maybe the client isn't in the wrong. However, sometimes color results can be tricky, especially with previous bleaching. But given the information, the author's position seems valid. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
