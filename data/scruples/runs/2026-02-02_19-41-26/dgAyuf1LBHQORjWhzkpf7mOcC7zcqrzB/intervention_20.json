I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a hairdresser not matching the requested hair color correctly.\n\nFirst, the user provided images that show the desired color versus the result. The person had shown the stylist a reference picture of light brown with a warm tone, emphasizing that they wanted more brown than red. They also mentioned that their hair was bleach blonde to start with. The stylist tried to fix it but the client is now saying they shouldn't have to pay for the correction.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and responsibility. The client made their desired color clear, showed a reference, and emphasized the color they wanted. If the stylist didn't follow that and ended up with a result that's more red than brown, maybe the stylist is at fault. But did the client take enough steps to ensure the color was understood? Sometimes hair color can be tricky depending on the base (bleach blonde can oxidize or lift more than expected), but the stylist should know that. If they didn't test the color or adjust for the base, they might be responsible.\n\nThe client is arguing they shouldn't have to pay again. If the mistake was on the stylist's end because they didn't follow the instructions or didn't account for the base color, then the client isn't in the wrong. But if the client didn't communicate clearly or the stylist did their best given the circumstances, maybe the client is at fault. However, the client did communicate multiple times and provided a reference. So maybe the stylist didn't do their job properly. In that case, the client isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
