I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they should have to pay for a hair fix after a bad coloring job. They showed their stylist a picture of light brown rose gold, emphasized wanting light brown, warm color, and mentioned they wanted more brown than red. The result was more red. They don't want to pay for the fix.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of both parties. The stylist is a professional, so they should follow the client's instructions. The client provided a reference image, repeated their preference, so the stylist should have met those expectations. If the stylist didn't ask for clarification during the process, that's on them. Also, the client might not be at fault if they communicated clearly and the stylist failed to deliver. However, sometimes hair color can be tricky, especially if the stylist didn't have the right products. But the client said they gave a week's notice, so the stylist should have gotten the necessary colors. If the stylist made a mistake, the client might not need to pay for the fix. But maybe the client's expectations were unreasonable? Like, maybe the picture wasn't a perfect match. But the client said they wanted more brown than red, so the result being too red is a problem. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B). But I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like if the client didn't confirm the color before leaving the salon. But since the issue was only noticed after the fact, the stylist is probably responsible. So the answer is B.\n"
