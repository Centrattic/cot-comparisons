I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a hairdresser not delivering the expected color, and the client wants it fixed for free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The client showed a picture of the desired color (light brown rose gold) and emphasized wanting more brown than red. They also mentioned that their hair was bleach blonde initially. The hairdresser did the color with more red tones. The client argues that since they communicated clearly, the hairdresser should fix it without charge.\n\nFrom the client's perspective, they made their request clear, provided visual reference, and highlighted the key elements. If the hairdresser didn't follow the instructions or failed to meet the agreed-upon outcome, the client might feel justified in expecting a free fix. However, hair color can be tricky, especially with bleached hair. The hairdresser might have had technical challenges or made a judgment call that didn't align with the client's expectations. \n\nBut in the service industry, if a professional doesn't deliver what was agreed upon, it's customary for them to offer a complimentary fix. However, the client's responsibility is to communicate their needs effectively. The client did that by showing the picture and reiterating the color preference. The hairdresser is responsible for executing it correctly. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the client didn't clarify enough, or the hairdresser couldn't achieve the exact look due to hair type. But in this case, the client emphasized multiple times. If the hairdresser didn't confirm or check the color during the process, it's their fault. \n\nSo, the client isn't in the wrong if they had clear communication and the service didn't meet the agreed-upon result. The hairdresser should take responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
