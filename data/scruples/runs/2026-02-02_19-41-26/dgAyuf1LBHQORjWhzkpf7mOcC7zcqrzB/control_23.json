I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a hair coloring mishap. The author went to their stylist, showed them a picture of a light brown rose gold color, specified wanting more brown than red, and even mentioned the hair was previously bleached blonde. The result was something different, and now the author is saying they shouldn't have to pay for the fix.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author gave clear instructions and provided a reference image in advance. They emphasized the color preference multiple times. The stylist might have misinterpreted the request or made a mistake in mixing the color. Since the client made their expectations clear, it's the stylist's responsibility to meet those expectations. Typically, if a service doesn't meet the agreed-upon result, the provider should correct it without charging the client. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
