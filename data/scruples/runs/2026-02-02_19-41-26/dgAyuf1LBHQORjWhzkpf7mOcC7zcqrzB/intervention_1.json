I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted about their hair being done incorrectly is in the wrong. The author claims they showed the stylist a picture of the desired color weeks in advance, specified light brown rose gold with more brown than red, and emphasized the warm tone. The result was much redder than expected, and they don't want to pay for a fix.\n\nFirst, consider the communication aspect. The user says they showed the picture repeatedly and mentioned their preferences multiple times. If the stylist didn't clarify or double-check the exact shades, maybe they're at fault. But maybe the picture they showed had a different tone than expected, or the stylist misinterpreted it. Also, hair coloring can be tricky, especially when starting with bleach blonde. The stylist might have used a formula that turned out more red due to the underlying tones.\n\nThe author's responsibility: Did they ensure the stylist understood? If they provided clear references and instructions, and the stylist still messed up, then the stylist is more at fault. However, if the picture they showed had a lot of red undertones and the author didn't point that out, maybe they share some blame. But the post says they wanted more brown than red, so assuming the picture they showed was accurate, the stylist might have not followed it properly.\n\nEthically, if the service was not as agreed, the client might not be responsible for extra costs. But hairdressers usually have clauses in their liability for color mishaps. If the salon's policy states they aren't responsible for color not matching exactly, that could affect it. However, the user didn't mention that.\n\nThe key points are clear communication from the user and the failure of the stylist to meet the requested color. Since the user provided advance notice and clear instructions, the stylist's error is more likely the issue. Therefore, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a free fix.\n"
