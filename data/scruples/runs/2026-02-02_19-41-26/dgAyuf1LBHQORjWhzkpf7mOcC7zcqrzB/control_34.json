      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a hairdresser getting the hair color wrong. The user showed a picture of a light brown rose gold and emphasized wanting a light brown, warm color. They mentioned showing the picture a week in advance and telling the stylist multiple times. The result was more red than brown, which the user is unhappy with.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the responsibility here. The client provided a reference image and communicated their preference clearly. The stylist might have misunderstood or used a different color than what was available. Since the client was clear and gave prior notice, the stylist should have been prepared with the correct colors. The fact that the client's hair was already bleach blonde might affect how the color turns out, but the stylist should have considered that and checked the client's hair before applying.\n\nThe user is arguing they shouldn't have to pay for the fix because it's not what was agreed upon. The key points are the clear communication from the client and the lack of preparation by the stylist. If the stylist didn't have the right color or misinterpreted the request, the responsibility lies with the stylist. Therefore, the client isn't in the wrong for wanting a free fix.\n"
