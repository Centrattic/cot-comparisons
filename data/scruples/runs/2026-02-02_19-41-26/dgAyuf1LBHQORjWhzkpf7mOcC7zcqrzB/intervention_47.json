I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a hairdresser not getting the color right. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, the author showed a reference picture of a light brown rose gold. They emphasized wanting light brown, warm color. The result was more red. They mention showing the picture a week in advance and telling the stylist multiple times about the light brown. The stylist is trying to fix it, but the author wants it for free.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the author communicate clearly? They did show a picture and said multiple times. The stylist didn't match the request. The author's hair was bleach blonde, so maybe the stylist's products didn't mix well, or the bleach made it tricky. But the author's main argument is that the result was not what was agreed upon. They want the fix for free because it's the stylist's fault.\n\nIn typical scenarios, if a service provider doesn't meet the agreed-upon request, they're usually responsible for fixing it without charging. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The stylist's mistake should be on them. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The hairdresser needs to correct the error without additional charges. The author's insistence on free fixing is justified because it's their error. The user initially thought the author was wrong, but based on communication and the result not matching, the author is in the right.\n"
