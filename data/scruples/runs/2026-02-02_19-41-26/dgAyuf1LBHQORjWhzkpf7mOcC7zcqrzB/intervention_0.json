I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a hairdresser not matching the requested hair color correctly.\n\nFirst, the user showed a reference image for a light brown rose gold. They emphasized wanting a light brown, warm color. They mentioned showing the picture a week in advance and told the stylist multiple times. The result was more red than brown. The user is upset and doesn't want to pay for the fix.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The client clearly communicated their request and provided a reference, so the hairdresser should have understood. If the stylist didn't have the right color, maybe they should have informed the client beforehand. The client's expectation was a light brown with some rose gold, not red tones. The stylist's mistake led to an undesired outcome. \n\nHowever, hair coloring can be tricky. Maybe the stylist tried to use a different technique or the client's hair reacted unexpectedly. But the client did their part by providing the image and instructions. The stylist is responsible for the outcome unless there was an unavoidable issue. Since the client is asking for a free fix, maybe the hairdresser should absorb the cost as it's their error. \n\nBut the user is saying they shouldn't have to pay. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. If the stylist made a mistake, the client isn't at fault. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
