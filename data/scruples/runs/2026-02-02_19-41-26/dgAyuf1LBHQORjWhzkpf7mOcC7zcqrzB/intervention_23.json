I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they went to a hairdresser, showed them a picture of a light brown rose gold color, emphasized they wanted light brown with more brown than red, and the result was way too red. Now they're arguing they shouldn't have to pay for the fix.\n\nFirst, the user provided a clear instruction: light brown, warm color, more brown than red. They even showed the picture in advance and mentioned the color multiple times. The hairdresser didn't follow the instructions correctly, leading to a result that's not what was agreed upon. The user's hair was already bleached blonde, so the color choice is important. The problem here seems to be the hairdresser's mistake in interpreting or executing the color. If the instructions were clear and the hairdresser didn't adhere to them despite being given the reference image, the responsibility lies with the professional. The user is asking if they're wrong for not wanting to pay, so if the error was on the hairdresser's side, the user isn't in the wrong. However, if the user didn't communicate effectively or the hairdresser did their best but it went wrong, maybe the user has a point. But given the details, the user did their part by showing the image and specifying the color. The hairdresser should have ensured they had the right colors and executed it correctly. So, the answer would be the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
