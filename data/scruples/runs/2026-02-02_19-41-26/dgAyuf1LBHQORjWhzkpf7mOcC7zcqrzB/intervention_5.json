I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a hairdresser not matching the requested color.\n\nThe user showed a picture of a light brown rose gold color. The hairdresser got it more red. The author argues that even though they can't match exactly, they wanted more brown than red and emphasized this. The hair was originally bleached blonde. The author is saying they shouldn't have to pay for the fix.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the communication. The author showed the picture a week in advance, mentioned the color multiple times, and clarified the preference. The hairdresser might have misunderstood or used a different color than intended. The problem is that the result is not what was agreed upon. \n\nIn service industries like hairdressing, there's an expectation that the client's request will be fulfilled as best as possible. If the hairdresser didn't listen to the instructions or made a mistake, the client is not necessarily in the wrong to expect a correction without charge. However, if the client's instructions were unclear or if the hairdresser faced technical challenges (like working with bleached hair which can be tricky), that might shift responsibility.\n\nBut the client did their part by providing a reference and emphasizing the color. The hairdresser's error in execution might be on them. So the client asking for a free fix seems reasonable. The author's position is that they clearly communicated the desire for more brown than red, which wasn't met. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
