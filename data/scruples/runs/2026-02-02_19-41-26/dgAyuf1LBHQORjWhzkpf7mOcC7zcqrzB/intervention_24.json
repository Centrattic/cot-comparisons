I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a hair coloring mishap.\n\nFirst, the user showed a picture of the desired look: light brown with a warm, rose gold tone. They emphasized wanting light brown, more brown than red. They mentioned that they showed the stylist the image a week in advance and repeated their request multiple times. The result was something more reddish with a rose tint, which the user is unhappy with. They don't want to pay for the fix.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user themselves think the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking opinions. So, what's the key here?\n\nHair coloring can be tricky. Even with clear communication, sometimes the end result isn't perfect. The stylist might have made a mistake in the color mix or application. The client did their part by providing a reference and emphasizing the color. The stylist's responsibility is to try to meet the client's expectations, especially when given a sample and repeated instructions.\n\nIf the stylist used a color that ended up being more red than the client intended, that's a mistake on their part. The client shouldn't have to pay for the correction since it's the stylist's error. However, maybe there's a nuance here. Did the client's hair being bleach blonde affect the outcome? Maybe the stylist couldn't achieve the exact shade due to the underlying tones from the bleaching, but that's a technical aspect the stylist should manage. If they didn't check the color during the process, it's their fault.\n\nThe client's argument is that they communicated clearly and the result wasn't what they asked. The stylist's responsibility is to deliver as per the client's instructions. Since the result wasn't what was agreed upon, the client isn't in the wrong to expect a free fix. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), but I need to check the details again.\n\nWait, the user says they showed the picture a week in advance. The stylist had time to prepare colors. If she didn't have the right colors, maybe that's a problem. But since the client said she's going to try to fix it, the issue is whether the client should pay. The client is arguing that it's the stylist's mistake, so they shouldn't have to pay. The user thinks the client is in the wrong, but maybe the client is justified here. So, answer B.\n"
