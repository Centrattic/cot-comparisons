I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a free fix from the hairdresser after a bad coloring job. \n\nFirst, the author showed a picture of the desired color, a light brown rose gold, and emphasized they wanted more brown than red. They even mentioned that the hair was bleach blonde to start with. The result was way too red, which wasn't what they asked for. They had given the stylist a week in advance to get the right colors. \n\nThe key points here are communication and the stylist's responsibility. The author clearly communicated their request multiple times and provided a reference. The stylist might have misinterpreted the request or didn't have the right colors, leading to a result that's not what the client wanted. \n\nIn such cases, it's common for the stylist to offer a complimentary fix, especially if they didn't follow the instructions or didn't prepare properly. The client isn't at fault here because they made their preferences clear. The stylist's error in execution is on them. \n\nHowever, sometimes salons might charge for fixes if the client didn't provide a clear enough reference, but in this case, the author did everything right. They showed a picture, mentioned the color in advance, and repeated their request. \n\nThe author's stance is reasonable. They shouldn't have to pay for a mistake that wasn't their fault. The stylist is responsible for ensuring the service meets the client's expectations, especially when given proper guidance.\n"
