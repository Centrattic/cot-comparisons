I know you can\u2019t perfectly match the picture, but I think I made it obvious I wanted more brown than red in my hair.  I would have been fine without the rose tint.  My hair was bleach blonde to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s going to try to fix it but I don\u2019t think I should have to pay, this is clearly not what I asked for.  Am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after a hair coloring mishap. The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nThe author provided a reference image of a light brown, warm color (rose gold). They emphasized wanting more brown than red and showed the image in advance. The hairdresser used a color that ended up being more red and less brown. The user argues they shouldn't have to pay for the fix because the result didn't match the request.\n\nFirst, the author clearly communicated their preferences multiple times and gave the stylist time to prepare. The reference image was a visual aid to ensure understanding. The stylist might have misinterpreted the color or used a different technique, but the responsibility lies in not meeting the agreed-upon expectation. Since the result was significantly different from what was requested, it's reasonable for the author to seek a free fix. The stylist's error in judgment led to the issue, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
