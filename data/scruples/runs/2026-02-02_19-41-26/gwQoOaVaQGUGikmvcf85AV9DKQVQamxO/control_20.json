When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who went to get his medications during a weekend trip, and the author was upset about it, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's situation. He has multiple chronic conditions: restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, anxiety, and GERD. These are real medical issues. Trigeminal neuralgia, for example, is known for causing severe facial pain. If his medications are crucial for managing his pain, then not taking them could lead to significant discomfort. The pharmacist transferred the meds, but the nearest Walgreens was two hours away. He tried to get them elsewhere but had insurance issues, so he had to go there. The four-hour drive seems extreme, but if he's in severe pain without his meds, it's understandable he'd prioritize that.\n\nNow, the author's perspective: they wanted the vacation to be relaxing and didn't want to go on a four-hour trip just to get meds. They felt it defeated the purpose of the trip. They got angry when he decided to go alone, and after returning, the boyfriend felt they were dismissive of his chronic pain. The boyfriend later broke up, citing the need for understanding. The author now thinks the boyfriend was being dramatic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend had legitimate medical needs. If he's in severe pain without his meds, going without could make the trip unbearable for him. The author might not have considered the severity of his conditions. However, it's also about communication and mutual understanding. The boyfriend could have explained the necessity more clearly, and the author might have been more empathetic. But from the boyfriend's side, if his pain is that severe, prioritizing his health makes sense. The author's anger and the subsequent behavior during the trip might have been hurtful. The breakup suggests that the boyfriend felt his needs weren't respected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting his medical needs and being dismissive.\n"
