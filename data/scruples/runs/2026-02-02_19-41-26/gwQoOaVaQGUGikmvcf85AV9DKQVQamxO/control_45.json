When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple on a vacation where the boyfriend goes to a pharmacy 2 hours away to get his medications, causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wanted a peaceful vacation and didn't want to drive back, so she refused to go. The boyfriend had multiple chronic conditions and needed his meds to manage the pain. He went alone, which made her upset, and later they broke up.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's health needs versus the author's desire for a relaxing trip. Chronic pain conditions like trigeminal neuralgia can be severe, and medications are often necessary to function. If he's in so much pain without his meds that he can't enjoy the trip, then getting them is crucial. On the other hand, the author might feel that he's overreacting, but she also didn't want to compromise by going with him or finding a middle ground like splitting the drive.\n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that his health issue is being prioritized over their time together. But the boyfriend's breakup reason suggests he felt unappreciated and misunderstood. He needed someone who could empathize with his chronic pain, which is a significant aspect of his life.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, she did express frustration and anger, which could be seen as not supporting his health needs. However, she also had valid feelings about wanting to enjoy their vacation. But when someone has a medical condition requiring medication, their health is a priority. The author could have approached it with more understanding, perhaps compromising by going partway or adjusting plans. Her reaction might have come from a place of stress rather than malice, but the boyfriend felt his needs were not being considered. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because her reaction didn't account for his medical necessity. However, it's a nuanced situation where both parties could have handled things better. But according to the boyfriend's perspective and the outcome, the author's actions (and her anger) contributed to the breakup. So, the answer might be A, yes, she's in the wrong because she didn't support his need for medication, which is critical for his well-being.\n"
