When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who needed to get his medications from a pharmacy two hours away, and the author didn't want to go with him, leading to a conflict and a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The boyfriend has chronic conditions like TN, which is described as severe. He needed his meds to manage the pain. The author wanted to enjoy the vacation without the 4-hour trip. The boyfriend went alone, but the author was upset about it, which led to tension during the trip. Later, the boyfriend broke up, citing the need for someone who understands his chronic pain.\n\nThe author is now defending themselves, thinking they were understanding but also frustrated about the trip. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFrom a perspective of support and empathy, the boyfriend's actions were necessary for his health. Chronic pain can be debilitating, and without medication, his quality of life would suffer. The author's frustration is understandable, but prioritizing their own comfort over the partner's health needs might be seen as selfish. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh, using the situation to justify a breakup, which could indicate his own issues.\n\nBut the key is whether the author was wrong. The boyfriend's health is a legitimate issue. The author could have supported him by going with him or at least expressing willingness to understand. By being upset and acting as \"an asshole,\" the author didn't show the necessary support. However, the boyfriend's decision to go alone was reasonable. The author's anger might have been misplaced if they didn't realize the severity of his conditions.\n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they had a right to want a relaxing vacation, but their reaction could have been more empathetic. However, the boyfriend's need for his meds is critical. The author's frustration might stem from not fully grasping the severity, which the boyfriend tried to explain. The author's anger leading to a negative trip and eventual breakup suggests a lack of support. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating a necessary health need, even if they thought the boyfriend was being dramatic. Answer A."
