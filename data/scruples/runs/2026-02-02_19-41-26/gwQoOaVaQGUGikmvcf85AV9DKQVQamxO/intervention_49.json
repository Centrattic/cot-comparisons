When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple going on a vacation where the boyfriend drives four hours to get his medication, and the author feels it ruined their trip. The boyfriend later breaks up with her, citing that she didn't understand his chronic pain issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend has multiple chronic conditions: restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia (TN), TMJ, anxiety, and GERD. TN is known to be a very painful condition. He needed meds for TN, which he couldn't get transferred locally due to insurance issues. So he had to drive two hours each way. The author wanted a quiet weekend and didn't want to go with him, leading to conflict.\n\nThe author's main point is that she was mad about him going alone for four hours, which she felt defeated the purpose of the trip. She later acted upset, and the breakup followed. She argues that no one's health issues are that bad that they can't go a few days without meds. But is she wrong?\n\nNow, I need to evaluate the validity of her anger. Chronic pain conditions can be debilitating. If TN is as severe as described, not having medication could lead to excruciating pain, making it impossible to function or enjoy the trip. The boyfriend's decision to get his meds was necessary for his well-being. The author, in refusing to go with him and then getting upset, might be missing the gravity of his medical needs.\n\nHowever, there's a balance between personal needs and a partner's medical necessity. The author's desire to enjoy the vacation without interruptions is understandable, but prioritizing her comfort over her partner's health might be problematic. On the flip side, the boyfriend's response was to go alone, which he had to do for his health, but his reaction of getting angry and later breaking up might be excessive. However, the breakup reason was based on the inability to understand his chronic issues, which the author now denies.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was unreasonable. If the boyfriend's health is genuinely critical, then her anger at him doing what's necessary for his comfort could be seen as selfish. But if the meds are just for managing pain and not life-threatening, maybe her reaction is valid. However, TN is a serious condition where even a short period without meds can cause severe pain. So, in that case, the boyfriend's need is legitimate.\n\nThe author's claim that the boyfriend is being dramatic and overreacting might be the issue. She might not have fully recognized the severity of his condition. Her anger at him driving four hours might stem from not understanding the necessity. Therefore, she could be in the wrong for not supporting his medical needs and for reacting negatively to his necessary action. The breakup might have been his way of setting a boundary, but the author's initial stance might have been dismissive of his legitimate health concerns.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because she didn't account for her boyfriend's legitimate medical needs and reacted poorly to his necessary action.\n"
