When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple's vacation where the boyfriend had to go get his medication, which the author didn't want to accompany him on a 4-hour round trip. They ended up breaking up because of this, and the author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend has several chronic conditions: restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia (TN), TMJ, anxiety, and GERD. He needed his medication for TN, which he said was crucial to managing his pain. The author wanted a quiet weekend and didn't want to leave, so she refused to go with him. The boyfriend went alone, and the author felt upset, leading to tension and eventually a breakup.\n\nNow, the author is thinking that the boyfriend is being dramatic and that no health issue can be so severe that he can't go a couple of days without medication. But I need to validate whether her reaction is reasonable or not.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia is a condition that causes severe, sudden, and electric shock-like pain in the face. It's known to be extremely debilitating. If left untreated, the pain can be so intense that it's hard to function, eat, or speak. The boyfriend mentioned that he could end up in such pain that he couldn't enjoy the trip, which seems plausible given the nature of TN. His meds are likely essential for managing that pain.\n\nThe author's main issue was wanting to enjoy the vacation without any disruptions. She didn't want to make the 4-hour trip, which he had to do alone. While it's understandable for her to want a relaxing time, her refusal to support him in getting his necessary medication might be seen as not prioritizing his health needs. However, she might not have realized the severity of his condition or the necessity of the medication.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's insistence on getting the meds, even at the cost of the trip's dynamic, might have been necessary for his well-being. If he's in too much pain without the meds, the trip would indeed be ruined. But his reaction of going alone and then lecturing her about his pain might have been harsh, especially if he didn't explain the severity beforehand.\n\nThe author's anger and frustration might stem from not feeling that her needs for a relaxing vacation were met. However, not accompanying him for a 4-hour trip might have been a valid choice, especially if they had already driven several hours to the cabin. The key here is communication and understanding each other's perspectives. The boyfriend might have needed to explain the critical nature of the medication more clearly, while the author might need to acknowledge the necessity of the meds for his condition.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit complex. The author's refusal to accompany him might not be entirely her fault, as she was trying to have a good time. However, her anger about the 4-hour trip defeating the purpose of the trip might have been a misunderstanding of his medical needs. The boyfriend's decision to go alone was necessary for his health, but his subsequent behavior and the breakup over the incident might indicate deeper issues in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. Her initial stance was to enjoy the vacation, and she did have a valid reason for not wanting to go on the 4-hour trip. However, her frustration and the way the situation escalated could have been handled better. The boyfriend's medical needs are significant, and the author's lack of understanding about the severity of his condition might be a factor. But the breakup seems to have been influenced by more than just that one incident, possibly indicating underlying issues. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation."
