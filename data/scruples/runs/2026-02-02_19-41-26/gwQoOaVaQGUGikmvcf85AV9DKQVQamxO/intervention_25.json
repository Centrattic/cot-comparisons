When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend going to get his medication during a vacation, and the author not wanting to go with him, leading to conflict and a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The boyfriend has multiple chronic conditions and needed his meds, which required a 4-hour round trip. The author didn't want to go, thinking it would ruin their vacation. The boyfriend went alone, and the author later expressed anger, leading to a breakup.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were just trying to enjoy their vacation and that the boyfriend overreacted. The boyfriend's side is that without the meds, he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the trip, and the author didn't understand his chronic pain.\n\nSo, the key points here are understanding chronic illness and the impact of medication. Chronic pain conditions like trigeminal neuralgia are known to be severe. If the meds are necessary to manage his symptoms, not taking them could lead to significant pain, making the vacation impossible to enjoy. The boyfriend's priority was his health, which is valid. The author might have been dismissive of his genuine medical needs, expecting him to endure without medication for the trip.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that the boyfriend is being dramatic, thinking that no health issue is so severe that a couple of days without meds would be unbearable. But in reality, some conditions require consistent medication to function normally. If the meds are time-sensitive or if the pain would be unbearable without them, then the boyfriend's actions make sense.\n\nThe conflict arises from differing priorities. The author wanted a peaceful vacation, but the boyfriend's health was a critical need. The author's reaction of anger and not supporting his medical necessity might have been the issue. Even if the author wanted to spend time together, the boyfriend's need for medication is a legitimate reason to take the trip. The breakup comment indicates that the boyfriend felt unsupported in his health struggles, which is a significant relationship issue.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more understanding. The boyfriend was trying to communicate his needs, and the author's anger and the \"asshole\" behavior might have been uncalled for. The author's refusal to accompany him might have been a minor issue compared to the boyfriend's medical necessity. The author's insistence on spending time together without considering the boyfriend's health might have been selfish in this context.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions were to address a medical need, which is a valid reason. The author's anger over not going along might have been misplaced. The boyfriend's explanation about his conditions and the necessity of the meds should have been a priority. If the author truly understood the severity, they might have found a way to support his decision without resentment. The fact that the breakup was referenced as the breaking point suggests that the author's reaction was a significant problem in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong. They didn't support the boyfriend's medical needs, leading to conflict and a breakup. The boyfriend's actions were necessary for his well-being, and the author's anger over that was unjustified. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
