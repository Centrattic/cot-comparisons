When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple going on a vacation where the boyfriend had to get his medications from a pharmacy 2 hours away. The author didn't want to go with him, leading to an argument and later a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend has several chronic conditions and needed his meds. He went alone, which the author didn't like because she wanted to enjoy the trip together. He argued that his health was more important, and later broke up with her, citing a lack of understanding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend's health is a significant factor. Chronic pain conditions like trigeminal neuralgia can be severe and debilitating. If he needed his medication to function, it's a legitimate medical necessity. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014she wanted a relaxing trip. But dismissing his need for medication could be seen as not taking his condition seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction might be overblown. He went to get the meds alone, which could have been a solution. However, the breakup seems extreme if the main issue was a one-time event. The author might feel that his reaction was disproportionate, especially if he's usually downplaying his pain. But if she didn't support his medical needs, that's a red flag in a relationship.\n\nI think the key points are the severity of his conditions and his need for medication. The author's anger at him going alone might be justified if she felt it ruined the trip, but not considering the medical necessity could make her seem dismissive. However, the boyfriend's response (breaking up) might be too harsh for the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether his health needs were genuine and if her response was reasonable. If he truly needed the meds to avoid severe pain, then expecting her to support that decision is valid. If she was unwilling to accommodate that, maybe she is at fault. But if the boyfriend overreacted to her valid feelings, then he's in the wrong. The story's author thinks he's being dramatic, but if his conditions are real, that's not the case. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she didn't support his medical needs, even if it disrupted the vacation. But if his reaction was too harsh, then B (not in the wrong). The line here is tricky. Given that chronic conditions require management, the author's lack of support might be the issue. So leaning towards A.\n"
