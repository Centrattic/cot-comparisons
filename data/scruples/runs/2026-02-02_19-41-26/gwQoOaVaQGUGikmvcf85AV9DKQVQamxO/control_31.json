When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple on a vacation where the boyfriend needed to get his medications. The author (the girlfriend) didn't want to go with him because she wanted to enjoy the trip, but she got upset when he went alone, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's health issues. He has several chronic conditions: trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, anxiety, GERD, and restless leg syndrome. Trigeminal neuralgia, in particular, is known for causing severe facial pain. If he's on medications for these, missing them for a couple of days could be really uncomfortable or even debilitating. So, his decision to go get the meds might be necessary for his well-being.\n\nThe author was upset because she felt the purpose of the trip was to spend time together, and he leaving for four hours took away from that. But does that mean she's in the wrong? Well, it's a conflict between his health needs and her desire for a relaxing vacation. Chronic pain management is a real issue, and someone with such conditions might prioritize their health over a vacation plan. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to go get the meds alone, which he saw as necessary. The author got angry and called him an asshole, which probably wasn't constructive. But was she wrong to feel frustrated? Maybe not entirely. It's understandable to feel upset when plans change, but she should have considered his health needs more. However, his response that he had to go regardless and then using the trip as a breaking point might be a bit harsh. \n\nBut the key here is the severity of his conditions. If his pain is truly that severe that he can't function without the meds, then getting them was necessary, and the author's reaction might be seen as not understanding his condition. On the other hand, maybe the boyfriend overreacted and the situation could have been handled better with communication. \n\nThe author says she thinks he's being dramatic and that no health problem could be so bad he can't go a couple days without meds. That might be the case if the conditions were mild, but trigeminal neuralgia, for example, can be extremely painful and sometimes even a mild flare-up can be excruciating. So, maybe she doesn't fully grasp the severity. \n\nIn relationships, understanding each other's needs is important. If he needed the meds, then going to get them is reasonable. Her frustration is valid, but her reaction might have been too harsh. However, the breakup seems a bit extreme if the main issue was a four-hour trip. Maybe both sides have some responsibility here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nGiven that he has legitimate health issues that require medication, and her anger over a necessary trip, it's possible that the author was inconsiderate of his needs. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. The boyfriend's explanation about not showing his worst pain might be a red flag if he's been downplaying it, but if he's been honest and this was a necessary action, then the author's reaction is less justified.\n"
