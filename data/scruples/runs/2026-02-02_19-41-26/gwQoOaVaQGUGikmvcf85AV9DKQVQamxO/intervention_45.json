When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a vacation where the boyfriend needed to go 4 hours to get his medication, and the author didn't want to go with him, leading to a conflict and a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend has multiple chronic conditions and relies on his meds to function. He tried to transfer the meds but faced insurance issues, so he had to go to a distant pharmacy. The author wanted a quiet vacation and was upset that he went alone, making her feel like the trip's purpose was ruined. She got angry, and later he broke up with her, citing her not understanding his chronic pain.\n\nThe author claims she was understanding, but he felt she wasn't supportive. The key points here are about empathy and communication. Chronic pain conditions like trigeminal neuralgia can be debilitating. If the meds are necessary to manage pain, not taking them could lead to severe discomfort. However, the author might feel that the trip's purpose was to spend time together, so his absence was a problem.\n\nI should consider whether the author's anger was justified. She didn't accompany him, which he was okay with, but her frustration about the 4-hour trip might have come from wanting quality time. However, his health is a serious matter. On the other hand, he might have communicated better or found a different solution. But given that he needed the meds to function, his decision to get them was necessary. The author's reaction might have been out of stress, but if she didn't support his health needs, that could be an issue in a relationship. The breakup seems related to deeper issues about understanding and support. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because she didn't support his medical needs, even if her intentions were to enjoy the vacation. But I should also consider if there was a lack of communication or if he should have planned better. However, given the chronic nature of his conditions, it's not something he can control. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to make sure. Let me check again. The boyfriend's actions were necessary for his health, and the author's anger might have been due to not recognizing the seriousness. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
