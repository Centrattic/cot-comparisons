When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset that her boyfriend went on a 4-hour drive to get his medication during their vacation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's situation. He has multiple chronic conditions: trigeminal neuralgia (TN), which is known to be extremely painful, along with other issues. He needed his medication to manage the pain, which he can't do without. The author initially didn't want to go with him, leading to conflict. He went alone, and she felt upset about spending the weekend alone. Then he broke up with her, citing that she didn't understand his chronic pain.\n\nThe author argues that he's being dramatic, thinking no one's pain is that bad that they can't go a couple days without meds. But TN is a severe condition; the pain can be debilitating. People with TN often rely on medications to function. If he went off his meds, even for a few days, it could mean excruciating pain, which would indeed make the trip unbearable or impossible for him. \n\nOn her side, she wanted a peaceful vacation and felt the trip's purpose was to spend time together. She didn't want to drive 4 hours again. Her frustration is understandable, but she might not have fully grasped the severity of his condition. However, she did express her feelings and he chose to go alone. \n\nThe breakup reason given was about not understanding his chronic pain. While her actions (getting mad) might have been a trigger, it's possible he had underlying issues. But the key point is whether her reaction was unreasonable. She had a right to feel upset about being alone, but she might have misjudged the necessity of the meds. However, chronic pain management is critical; without meds, he couldn't enjoy the trip. \n\nSo, in terms of right/wrong: the author might have been acting out of frustration, but her perspective might not have considered the medical necessity. However, her reaction could be seen as not fully empathizing with his condition. On the other hand, the boyfriend's decision to go alone was necessary for his health, but perhaps he could have explained that more clearly. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then her not supporting his medical needs was wrong. If B (no), then she's justified in her feelings. Given that chronic pain is real and severe, and his actions were necessary for his well-being, the author might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's room for both perspectives. However, the breakup being based on that weekend suggests that maybe he felt she was dismissive of his needs. But the question is about the author's actions. Since she was upset about being alone and he had a valid medical reason, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whose perspective is more valid. But given that his health is a critical factor, the author might be in the wrong for not fully supporting his medical needs. But if the answer is B (not in the wrong), because she had a right to feel upset about the situation. Hmm. I think the key is whether his medical need was truly urgent. If the meds were necessary to prevent severe pain, then the author's refusal to go with him or support that decision might be seen as not understanding his condition. Therefore, she's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
