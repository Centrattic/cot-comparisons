When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple going on a vacation. The boyfriend has several chronic health conditions and forgot his medication. He decides to drive 2 hours to a pharmacy that's far away, while the author didn't want to go along. The author was upset because she thought the point of the trip was to spend time together, but he left for 4 hours. He ended up going alone, and the author was angry, which led to a breakup a week later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend has multiple chronic conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia (TN), which I know can be extremely painful. He mentioned that without his meds, he might not be able to function or enjoy the trip. The author, on the other hand, wanted to enjoy a quiet weekend without interruptions. She didn't want to make the extra drive, but she got upset when he decided to go alone.\n\nThe key points here are understanding the severity of his health issues and how the author's reaction was in response to that. The author claims she was understanding, but the boyfriend felt she didn't truly grasp the severity of his condition. He felt he needed the meds to avoid unbearable pain, which could have ruined the trip for him. The author's anger and the way she reacted might have come off as dismissive of his chronic pain, even if she thought she was being logical.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia is a condition where even mild stimuli can cause excruciating pain, so going without medication could indeed be a big deal. The boyfriend's priority was his health, while the author's was enjoying the vacation. But in a relationship, partners need to support each other's needs. If he felt that his health was at risk, going to get the meds was necessary. The author might not have recognized that his need for the medication was a valid and urgent part of their trip, which could lead to resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to want to enjoy the vacation as planned. Maybe she could have suggested alternative solutions, like going together if possible, or adjusting the plans. But she chose to get angry instead of trying to understand his medical necessity. The boyfriend's breakdown about the chronic pain and his feelings of being misunderstood could indicate that the author didn't provide the emotional support he needed.\n\nIn the end, the breakup was partly due to communication issues and differing priorities. The author's reaction might have been inconsiderate of his health needs, which are beyond his control. So, while the author had her perspective, not considering the boyfriend's medical necessity and the severity of his condition could make her at fault.\n"
