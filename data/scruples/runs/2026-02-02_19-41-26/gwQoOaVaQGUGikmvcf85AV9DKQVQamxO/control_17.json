When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend going on a 4-hour drive to get his medications during a weekend trip, and the author not wanting to go with him.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend has several chronic conditions: restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, anxiety, and GERD. He needs his meds for these, especially the ones for trigeminal neuralgia, which he mentioned. The author wanted a quiet weekend together and initially refused to go, but later got upset when he left. The boyfriend felt that without the meds, he wouldn't be able to handle the trip, leading to a breakup.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The boyfriend had a valid medical reason to get his medications. Chronic pain conditions can be debilitating. For example, trigeminal neuralgia is known for causing severe, sudden facial pain. If his meds were necessary to function, not taking them could make the trip unbearable. The author's anger at him driving alone for four hours might be seen as not considering his health needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the trip was planned to be a shared experience, so the boyfriend's absence for so long disrupted that. But the boyfriend's priority was managing his health, which is crucial. The author's reaction could come off as selfish or not taking his conditions seriously, which the boyfriend pointed out. The breakup reason suggests that the author might have been dismissive of his real needs, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe author says they think the boyfriend is being dramatic. However, the severity of the medical conditions mentioned is real. People with chronic pain often downplay their symptoms to avoid seeming burdensome. If the author didn't support this necessary trip, it might indicate a lack of understanding or empathy, which is a big issue in a relationship. So, the boyfriend's perspective is that the author didn't acknowledge his health struggles, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the actions were unreasonable. The boyfriend needed his meds, and the author's refusal to accompany him and subsequent anger might be seen as the wrong here. The boyfriend acted in his health's best interest, which is understandable. The author's frustration could be seen as not prioritizing his well-being, hence, answer A.\n"
