When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the situation is about a couple on a vacation. The boyfriend needed to get his medication, which was a 4-hour round trip. The author didn't want to go with him because she wanted to enjoy the vacation and spend time together. She got angry when he left, and later he broke up with her, citing that she didn't understand his chronic pain. The author thinks she was understanding and he's being dramatic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend has several chronic conditions that require medication. Trigeminal neuralgia, for example, is known for severe pain. If his medications are crucial, not getting them could lead to significant discomfort. He tried to transfer the meds but had insurance issues, so he had to go to a farther pharmacy. That's a long drive, but he went alone. \n\nThe author's perspective is that she wanted the trip to be about their time together and was upset that he left for 4 hours. But maybe she didn't realize how critical the medication was. The boyfriend felt that his health was a priority, and the author was being dismissive of his needs. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The key points are: Did she not support his medical needs? Was her reaction reasonable? Chronic pain conditions can be debilitating, and people might need to manage them even on vacation. If the meds were necessary for him to function, then getting them was important. The author's frustration might stem from wanting quality time, but the boyfriend's health is a valid reason. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have been more flexible or tried to find a compromise. But the boyfriend went alone, which he had to do for his health. The breakup was based on her not understanding his chronic issues. If she truly didn't grasp the severity, that might be a problem in the relationship. But is it the author's fault for not knowing, or is the boyfriend overreacting? The author might not have known the full extent of his pain until he explained it during the trip. \n\nTrigeminal neuralgia can cause episodes of intense pain, and without medication, it might be unbearable. So the boyfriend's decision to get the meds was necessary. The author was upset about the time they lost, but his health is a priority. Therefore, maybe the author was in the wrong for not being more supportive. But maybe she had a right to feel that her wishes for the vacation were also important. However, in a relationship, supporting each other's health needs is crucial. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the boyfriend's health was a valid reason, and her reaction was not supportive enough. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The author might have thought the meds weren't that critical. But given the conditions he has, it's possible they are necessary. So yes, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
