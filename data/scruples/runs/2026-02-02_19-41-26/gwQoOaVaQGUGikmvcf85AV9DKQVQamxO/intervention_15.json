When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The person is upset that their boyfriend went 4 hours away to get his medication, even though the trip was supposed to be about spending time together. The boyfriend had several chronic conditions and felt he needed the meds to even function during the trip. The author is now wondering if they were wrong for getting angry about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's health issues are serious\u2014restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, anxiety, and GERD. Trigeminal neuralgia can be extremely painful, and the medications he's on are likely crucial for managing that pain. If he's not on his meds, he might be in so much pain that he can't enjoy the vacation at all, which makes the trip pointless for him. The author's intention was to spend time together, but if he's in unbearable pain, then the trip can't be enjoyable for either of them. So he going to get his meds makes sense from a medical necessity standpoint.\n\nOn the author's side, they wanted a quiet vacation without the stress of driving. They didn't want to go with him, which might have been a reasonable request. But when he decided to go alone, she got angry because it seemed like the trip's purpose was defeated. However, from the boyfriend's perspective, not going for the meds would have defeated the trip's purpose even more because he'd be in pain. \n\nThe breakup happened later, with the boyfriend citing the need for understanding about his chronic health issues. The author thinks the boyfriend is being dramatic, but if the boyfriend genuinely needs the medication to function, then his decision was necessary. The author's anger might stem from not fully understanding the severity of his conditions. Chronic pain is often invisible, and people might not realize how debilitating it can be. The boyfriend's frustration could be because he felt his partner didn't recognize the seriousness of his health issues, leading to the breakup.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, while wanting to enjoy the vacation is valid, not acknowledging the necessity of the medication for the boyfriend's well-being might have been a mistake. The author might have seen it as a minor inconvenience, but for the boyfriend, it was a necessity for his quality of life. The author's reaction could have been seen as dismissive of his pain and health needs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting the necessary action, even if it meant a temporary separation during the trip. However, the boyfriend's response (breaking up over this) might have been overly harsh, but the core issue is whether the author's actions were wrong. Considering the boyfriend's health needs, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't fully support the necessary medical action.\n"
