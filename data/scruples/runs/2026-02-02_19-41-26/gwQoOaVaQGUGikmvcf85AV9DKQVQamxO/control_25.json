When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple going on a vacation, where the boyfriend needs to go get his medication, which requires a 4-hour round trip. The author of the post (the girlfriend) didn't want to go along, leading to conflict and eventually a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The boyfriend has multiple chronic conditions and relies on medication. He had a long drive to transfer the meds because of insurance issues. The author felt the trip was supposed to be about spending time together, but he prioritized getting his meds. She got angry, he got angry, and the relationship ended. She's now questioning if she's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, his health is critical. Chronic pain conditions like trigeminal neuralgia can be severe, and without medication, he might be in unmanageable pain. The fact that he went alone suggests he felt it was necessary. The author's reaction might have been valid in wanting quality time, but maybe she didn't fully grasp the urgency of his medical needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt her needs for relaxation and connection were being ignored. She might have thought a weekend away was meant to be a break from such stress. But he felt his health was a priority. There's a balance between personal needs and a partner's medical requirements.\n\nThe key points are: Did she invalidate his health needs? Did she act unreasonably by refusing to go with him? If he needed the meds to function, then her reaction might be seen as not supportive. However, if he could have managed without them for the weekend, maybe she's justified. But since he claimed it was essential, and he went alone, perhaps she overreacted in not supporting his medical necessity.\n\nAlso, the aftermath: he broke up citing her not understanding his health. If he felt she was dismissive, maybe she was. But she thinks he's being dramatic. The question is whether her anger was misplaced. It's a tough call. In relationships, supporting each other's needs is important. If his health is a real, serious issue, then going out of his way for meds is necessary. Her anger might have been overreacting to that necessity. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But if the medication wasn't absolutely critical for the weekend, then maybe not. However, given his conditions, it's likely the meds are crucial. Therefore, the answer leans towards A.\n"
