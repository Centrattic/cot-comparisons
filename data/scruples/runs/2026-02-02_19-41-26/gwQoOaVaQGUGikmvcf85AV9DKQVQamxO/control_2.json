When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple on a vacation where the boyfriend has several chronic health conditions and needed to get his medication, which required a 4-hour round trip. The author didn't want to go along and ended up being upset, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wanted a quiet vacation and didn't want to make the long drive, so she told her boyfriend she wasn't coming. He went alone, and she felt it ruined the trip. He later broke up with her, saying she didn't understand his chronic pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has multiple medical issues. He needed his medication to manage his pain, and without it, he wouldn't be able to enjoy the trip. He felt he had to get the meds, even if it meant a long drive alone. His perspective is that his health needs are critical and that the author didn't take them seriously.\n\nThe author thinks he's being dramatic and that no health problem is so bad that you can't go a couple days without meds. But is that accurate? Conditions like trigeminal neuralgia are known to be very painful, and missing medication could lead to severe episodes. TMJ and GERD might also be managed with meds, and anxiety meds are typically not something you skip without consequence.\n\nThe author's main issue was not wanting to make the 4-hour trip. She might have thought it was unnecessary, but if the meds were crucial, then the boyfriend had a valid reason. However, maybe there was a lack of communication or consideration. The author could have offered to drive him, or maybe they could have planned better before the trip. The fact that he went alone might have been necessary, but the author's reaction of being angry and then being an \"asshole\" according to him, led to the breakup.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. From the boyfriend's side, his health is a serious issue, and the author didn't support him in getting the necessary medication. From the author's side, she wanted a relaxing vacation and felt it was being ruined. But prioritizing health is important, and if the meds are essential, then the boyfriend's actions were necessary.\n\nI think the author might have a point in wanting to enjoy the vacation, but she might not have fully considered the severity of her boyfriend's conditions. However, the boyfriend's reaction to the breakup seems a bit harsh if the situation wasn't that dire. But given that he has chronic conditions, maybe his needs are valid. The author's insistence on not going might have been selfish, not considering that his health affects the trip's success. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But I'm a bit torn because it's a complex situation where both might have valid points. However, based on the boyfriend's explanation and the chronic conditions, the author not supporting his medical needs could be seen as the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
