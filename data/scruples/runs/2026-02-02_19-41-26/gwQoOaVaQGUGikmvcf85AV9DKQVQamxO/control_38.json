When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple on a vacation. The boyfriend has several chronic health conditions and forgot his meds. He needs to drive two hours to get them, which would take four hours total. The author didn't want to go with him because she wanted to relax and not drive again. The boyfriend went alone, and the author felt it ruined the trip. Then they broke up, and he cited this incident as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's health issues are serious: trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, anxiety, GERD, etc. Trigeminal neuralgia, in particular, is known for causing severe facial pain. If his medications are crucial, not having them could make the trip unbearable for him. He might be in so much pain that he can't enjoy the vacation, which would make the trip worse overall. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wanted to enjoy their time together without the stress of driving. She might feel that the trip's purpose was to have quality time, and his absence for four hours made it hard. But maybe she didn't fully understand the severity of his condition. The boyfriend did explain his conditions, so if she was dismissive, that could be an issue.\n\nThe key points here are understanding and support in a relationship. Chronic pain is real and can be debilitating. If the boyfriend genuinely needed the meds to function, then his decision to get them was necessary. The author's anger at him going alone might come from not appreciating the urgency of his health needs. However, she might have a point if she felt neglected or that the trip was ruined. But in a relationship, supporting each other's health needs is important. \n\nThe boyfriend later broke up, saying she didn't understand his chronic issues. If he felt she was inconsiderate of his health, even if she thought she was understanding, maybe there was a communication gap. The author's frustration might be valid, but her reaction (being an \"asshole\" as he said) could have been out of proportion if she didn't take his pain seriously. \n\nI think the main question is whether the author was inconsiderate of his medical needs. If she didn't take his chronic pain seriously, then she might be in the wrong. But if she was just wanting to enjoy the vacation and didn't realize the severity, maybe not. However, after he explained his conditions, her anger might have been unwarranted. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't support his necessary medical needs, even if she had her own feelings about the trip.\n"
