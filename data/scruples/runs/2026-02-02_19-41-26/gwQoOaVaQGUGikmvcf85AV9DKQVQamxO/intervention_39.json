When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple on a weekend trip. The boyfriend needed to pick up some meds because he forgot them at home. The author (the girlfriend) didn't want to go with him, thinking it would ruin the vacation. The boyfriend went alone, and then there was some conflict, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's health issues. He has several chronic conditions: restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia (TN), TMJ, anxiety, and GERD. TN is a serious condition causing severe facial pain. The author argues that he's being dramatic and that no health problem would be so bad he can't go a couple days without meds. But I should check if that's accurate.\n\nTrigeminal neuralgia is known for causing excruciating pain, often described as electric shocks. Without medication, the pain can be debilitating and constant. So if he's on medication to manage that, going without could make the trip unbearable. The boyfriend's decision to get the meds might not be just about convenience but necessity to function.\n\nThe author wanted to enjoy the vacation without interruptions, but she was upset that he left for 4 hours. However, the boyfriend's priority was his health. The argument here is about balancing personal needs (his health) versus the shared vacation experience. The author seems to dismiss his pain as an overreaction, which might not be valid if his conditions are indeed severe.\n\nThe breakup reason given by the boyfriend was the lack of understanding about his chronic pain. The author claims she was understanding, but the situation shows a conflict where her expectations (a quiet trip) clashed with his medical needs. If she didn't support his necessary action, even if it disrupted the trip, that could be a failure to prioritize his health.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether her reaction was reasonable. If the boyfriend genuinely needed the meds to endure the trip, then the author's anger might be unwarranted. On the other hand, the boyfriend driving 4 hours alone for meds could be seen as overreacting, but given the chronic pain, it's a necessary action. The author might have been inconsiderate of his needs, leading to the breakup. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
