When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author and her boyfriend went on a weekend trip to a cabin. The boyfriend realized he forgot some medications at home, specifically for trigeminal neuralgia (TN), which he gets from his usual Walgreens. They tried to transfer the meds to a closer pharmacy, but there were insurance issues, so the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. The boyfriend decided to go there, which would take a 4-hour round trip. The author didn't want to go with him, thinking it was a nice quiet weekend to spend together. She got upset when he went alone, arguing that it defeated the purpose of the trip. He got angry in return, explaining that without the meds, he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the trip. He later broke up with her, citing that she didn't understand his chronic health issues.\n\nThe author thinks he's being dramatic and that they should have just gotten through the weekend without the meds. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Chronic pain conditions like TN can be very severe. Trigeminal neuralgia is known for causing intense, sudden facial pain. If the boyfriend's medications are essential for managing that pain, not taking them could result in severe discomfort. If he's in a lot of pain, it would indeed make it hard to enjoy the trip. So from his perspective, getting the meds was necessary for his well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wanted a relaxing weekend together and was frustrated that he left for 4 hours. She might feel that the trip's purpose was ruined by his absence. However, maybe she didn't fully grasp the severity of his condition. The boyfriend mentioned that he downplays his pain to avoid burdening others, which suggests he might not always show how much he's suffering. So when he needed the meds, he might have been in significant pain that he's not usually open about.\n\nThe argument here is about empathy and understanding chronic illness. The author might have thought the 4-hour trip was unnecessary, but if those meds are crucial for his ability to function, then it's not just about the trip. The breakup was based on her not understanding his health issues, which is a serious thing in a relationship. Trust and support for each other's health needs are important.\n\nI should also consider if there were alternative solutions. Maybe they could have taken a different approach, like contacting a local pharmacy earlier or using a delivery service. But given the situation, he had to go to the far Walgreens. The author might feel that he should have handled it differently, but if he's in pain, his priority is to get the medication.\n\nSo, was the author wrong? She might not have considered the severity of his condition and the necessity of the medication. By getting angry and not supporting his need to get the meds, she might have been dismissive of his health issues. The boyfriend felt that her reaction showed a lack of understanding, which led to the breakup. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't support her partner's medical needs, which are crucial for his well-being during their trip.\n"
