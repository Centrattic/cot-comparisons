When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple going on a vacation, and the boyfriend needs his medications. The author, the girlfriend, didn't want to go with him to get the meds because she wanted to enjoy the trip. She thought he should just get them alone, which ended up making her angry and causing a breakup later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the boyfriend's perspective. He has multiple chronic conditions, including trigeminal neuralgia (TN), which is known to be extremely painful. The user argues that he shouldn't have to go through that pain, so getting his meds is crucial for his well-being. The author, on the other hand, thought that the trip's purpose was to spend time together and that the boyfriend going alone ruined it. \n\nNow, the key points here are empathy and communication. The boyfriend felt that his health needs were not being respected. He had to make a 4-hour round trip, which is a significant commitment. The author, while understanding his conditions, apparently didn't realize the severity, which he explained during the trip. She later claims she was understanding, but the boyfriend felt neglected and that she didn't truly grasp the impact of his chronic pain.\n\nIt's possible that the author didn't fully consider how much the meds affect his ability to function and enjoy the trip. Even if the trip was meant to be together, there might be times when individual needs take precedence. The boyfriend's insistence on getting the meds might have been necessary for him to even be able to enjoy the trip the rest of the time. Without the meds, he might not have been able to participate in activities or be in a good mood.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might have felt that the trip was a chance to connect, and the boyfriend's absence for four hours disrupted that. However, maybe she could have been more flexible, understanding that his health is a priority. The breakup was partly based on the boyfriend feeling unsupported regarding his chronic illness, which is a significant issue in a relationship. \n\nChronic pain conditions are real and can severely impact daily life. If the boyfriend's conditions are such that even a few days without medication would be unbearable, then his actions make sense. The author's reaction might stem from not fully comprehending the gravity of his situation, even if she claims to be understanding. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's inconsiderate remarks and the way she reacted might have been a mistake. The boyfriend needed support and understanding, and her anger might have come off as dismissive of his health needs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being empathetic enough towards his chronic pain and the necessity of getting his meds, even if it meant a four-hour drive.\n"
