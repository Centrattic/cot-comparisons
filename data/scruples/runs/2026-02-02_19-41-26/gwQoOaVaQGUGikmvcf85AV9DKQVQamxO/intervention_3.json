When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple going on a vacation to a cabin. The boyfriend has several health issues and forgot some medications. He needs to drive four hours round trip to get them because of insurance issues. The author didn't want to go with him, thinking it would ruin their vacation. They had an argument, and the boyfriend ended up going alone. The author felt upset and later the relationship ended, with the boyfriend citing the need for understanding his chronic pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main point is that they just wanted a peaceful vacation and saw the four-hour trip as unnecessary and ruining their time together. The boyfriend, on the other hand, had legitimate health issues that require medication to manage his pain. He felt that without the meds, he wouldn't be able to enjoy the vacation at all, which would defeat the purpose. He also mentioned that he often downplays his pain to avoid worrying others, but the author didn't understand his situation.\n\nThe author claims to be understanding, but the boyfriend felt that she was being dismissive of his real health needs. The key here is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate of her boyfriend's medical needs. Chronic conditions like trigeminal neuralgia are known to be extremely painful. If the medications are essential for his comfort, then not taking them could indeed make the trip unbearable for him. The author's anger at him going to get the meds might have come from a place of wanting quality time together, but if the boyfriend's health is compromised, then the vacation might not be enjoyable for either of them in the long run.\n\nThe author's insistence that the boyfriend's health issues aren't that severe and that he's being dramatic could be the problem. Even if the medications aren't life-saving, managing chronic pain is crucial for daily functioning and quality of life. The author might not have fully appreciated the severity of his condition, leading to a conflict. The boyfriend's frustration likely stemmed from feeling misunderstood and unsupported, which could have contributed to the breakup.\n\nSo, while the author's intention was to enjoy their vacation together, not accounting for her partner's legitimate medical needs and dismissing his concerns might have been inconsiderate. It's a balance between wanting shared experiences and respecting individual health needs. The author's reaction could be seen as self-centered in this context, especially after the breakup where the boyfriend cited the need for understanding. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not fully supporting her partner's health requirements, even if her intention was to have a peaceful trip.\n"
