When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend on a weekend getaway. The boyfriend had to go 4 hours away to get his meds because the closest pharmacy was that far. The author didn't want to go with him and got angry, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend has multiple chronic conditions: restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ, anxiety, and GERD. He needed his meds, which he gets from a specific Walgreens that's two hours away. The author didn't want to leave the cabin and was upset when he went alone, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author claims she was just trying to enjoy the vacation and didn't want to spend 4 hours driving. The boyfriend felt the meds were necessary to avoid severe pain and couldn't enjoy the trip without them. He ended up going alone, and the author was upset the whole weekend, which led to the breakup. Now the author thinks the boyfriend is overreacting and that she's in the right.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, chronic pain conditions can be very debilitating. Trigeminal neuralgia is known to be extremely painful, and without proper medication, the pain can be incapacitating. The boyfriend was trying to manage his health, which is a valid and important thing. The author's frustration with the 4-hour trip might not take into account the severity of his condition. She wanted to enjoy the vacation, which is understandable, but his health needs are critical. However, it's also about communication and mutual understanding in a relationship. \n\nThe author was upset that he left, but perhaps she didn't fully grasp that his health was a priority. The boyfriend felt that she didn't understand his chronic pain issues, leading to the breakup. The author's anger about the 4-hour drive might have been out of proportion, especially when his meds are crucial. On the flip side, maybe the boyfriend could have explained the situation better or found a compromise, but he did mention the need to get the meds to avoid pain. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author might have been dismissive of his health needs, which is a significant issue. Her reaction could have been seen as not supporting her partner during his health challenges. Therefore, she might be in the wrong, which would be answer A.\n"
