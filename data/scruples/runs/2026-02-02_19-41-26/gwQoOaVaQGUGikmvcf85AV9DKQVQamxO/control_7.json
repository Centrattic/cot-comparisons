When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend on a vacation. The boyfriend needed to get his medications from a pharmacy two hours away, which would take four hours total. The author (the girlfriend) didn't want to go with him, leading to an argument and eventually a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend has several chronic conditions and states that without his meds, he can't function. He had to go get them because the local pharmacy couldn't handle the insurance transfer. The author felt that the purpose of the trip was to spend time together, and he leaving for four hours undermined that. The boyfriend felt that his health was a priority and that the author didn't understand his chronic pain.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the boyfriend had a valid medical need. Chronic pain conditions can be debilitating, and not taking necessary medications could lead to severe discomfort. The author might have been selfish in not supporting his medical needs, even if it meant the two of them not spending the entire time together. On the other hand, she also wanted to enjoy the vacation, which is understandable. However, the boyfriend's health is a primary concern. If the meds are essential, then getting them shouldn't be seen as a disruption but a necessity. The author's anger at him going to get the meds might come off as dismissive of his health issues. The boyfriend's perspective is that the author didn't understand the severity of his conditions, and that could have been a legitimate issue in their relationship. The breakup mention suggests that this was a significant point in their conflict.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author was being unreasonable. If the boyfriend needed the meds to be able to even enjoy the vacation in the first place, then the author should have been supportive. Her anger at him going to get the meds, even if it meant 4 hours alone, might indicate a lack of consideration for his health. The boyfriend's explanation about his conditions and the need for medication seems valid. So the author might be in the wrong for not supporting his necessary medical action, even if it meant spending some time apart during the trip.\n"
