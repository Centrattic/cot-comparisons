When we were there and unpacking, my boyfriend realized he forgot some of his meds at home (he has restless leg syndrome, trigeminal neuralgia, some sort of TMJ issue, anxiety, and GERD), and decided to find the closest Walgreens to transfer over the meds he takes for TN since he gets his meds from the Walgreens at home. They agreed to transfer and had them ready for him to pickup, but the closest Walgreens was about 2 hours away. He tried to transfer it to a different closer pharmacy, but there were issues with insurance, so he was just going to go to that Walgreens.\n\nI wanted a nice, quiet weekend. I didn't want to leave or drive anywhere else since we did that long drive, so I told him I wasn't coming. He seemed fine with going alone for what would be 4 hours total just to get a few pills. I got mad and told him the whole point of this was to spend time together and if he left for 4 hours to get his drugs it would defeat the whole purpose of the trip. He got pretty mad and told me it would defeat the purpose of the trip if he was in so much pain he couldn't move or speak so he was going to get his meds whether I wanted him to or not. I got a whole lecture about chronic pain and how I don't think he's as bad off as he really is because he doesn't let me see him at his worst when he's in the most pain, and I may see that during this trip because we'll be together for several days. He told me about what TN is, how it impacts the body, what his meds do to help, etc. Basically, the bottom line was, he was convinced he'd be in too much pain to enjoy the weekend without these meds. \n\nSo he went to the Walgreens and I sat alone in a cabin in a beautiful area for 4 hours, and he returned with just a few pills. He drove 4 hours for some drugs because he claims they make him be in less pain. I guess I was madder about it than I thought because, according to him, I was an asshole the whole weekend. \n\nHe actually broke up with me a week later and referenced that weekend when I asked him what the breaking point was. He said he needs someone that understands he has chronic health problems that are not his fault he has, are incurable, and that he will probably need meds or some sort of treatment for for the rest of his life. That person needs to understand he is in pain, and he often downplays that pain as to not bother or concern people with it. \n\nNow, I think this is BS and that I was totally understanding. I think he's being dramatic, especially about that weekend. No way any health problem hurts that badly someone can't go a couple days without medication. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the author and her boyfriend went on a weekend cabin trip. He forgot some meds and wanted to drive 2 hours to get them because his insurance had issues. She didn't want to go with him, thinking it would ruin their time together. He went alone, she was upset the whole weekend, and they broke up later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend has chronic conditions like trigeminal neuralgia (TN), which I know can be really painful. TN is a nerve disorder that causes severe, sudden, sharp pain in the face. If he's on medication for it, going without could mean unbearable pain. So, maybe his decision to get the meds wasn't just about convenience but about managing his health. \n\nThe author wanted to enjoy the vacation without interruptions. That's understandable too. But when he left, she got mad because she thought it defeated the purpose. But if he was in actual pain, not taking his meds could make the entire trip unbearable for him. So maybe she didn't take into account the severity of his condition.\n\nHe also mentioned that he downplays his pain to avoid worrying others. That might mean he usually doesn't show his worst moments, so when he did explain, she might have overreacted. The breakup reason he gave was about needing someone who understands his chronic issues. If she didn't acknowledge the seriousness of his health, maybe that's a valid reason for him to end the relationship.\n\nBut wait, is it possible he overreacted? Did he really need the meds so badly that a two-day break would be catastrophic? Some medications can be refilled or adjusted. Maybe the author felt he exaggerated his need. However, without knowing the specifics of his treatment plan, it's hard to say. Trigeminal neuralgia can be debilitating, so his meds are likely crucial.\n\nThe author claims she was understanding, but her reaction was anger and saying he was an asshole. That's not helpful. Even if she didn't agree with his decision, being rude might have been a mistake. On the other hand, if she felt her needs weren't considered, maybe she had valid feelings too.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she dismissed his health concerns and reacted poorly, maybe yes. But if he was being overly dramatic, then no. The key here is understanding chronic illness. Most people can't relate to how severe TN is. The author might not have recognized the real impact of his condition. Therefore, he might have a legitimate point in needing the meds, and her response was inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong). But if she's justified in thinking he overreacted, then B. But given the context, the boyfriend's health issues are real and serious, so she should have been more understanding. So probably A.\n"
