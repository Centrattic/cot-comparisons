I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for swearing at the server. The situation is that the author was at a bar with friends, got hungry after waiting a while, and the server played \"keep away\" with their food. The author then said \"Give me my god damn food\" sternly, and the server complied.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had waited a long time, had two beers but wasn't drunk or aggressive. The server's action of pulling back the food was playful (\"keep away\"), which the author found irritating. The author has a history in service jobs, so they understand the importance of good service, which adds to the irony here.\n\nNow, the key points: The author was hungry and frustrated after waiting, the server's behavior was inconsiderate, and the author's response was a stern but not violent reaction. The server stopped the game after the outburst. \n\nThe question is whether the author's response was justified. Swearing is often seen as inappropriate, but the context matters. If the server was being deliberately annoying, maybe the author had cause. However, the server might have been trying to be playful, not malicious. The author's tone was stern but not aggressive. \n\nFrom a perspective of workplace conduct, even if the server was at fault, using a swear word might be unprofessional. However, the author's history in service jobs suggests they understand the impact of their actions. The friends' reaction (\"looked at me weird\") indicates that the social context might view the outburst as over the line, even if understandable.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the server's actions were a harmless joke or a deliberate act of meanness. If the server was just being playful, the author's reaction might be seen as excessive. But if the server was being unprofessional, the author's frustration is more understandable. However, the author chose to respond with a curse word, which could be seen as inconsiderate regardless. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because even if the server was being annoying, using a swear word in a public setting could be seen as disrespectful. The author's history in service jobs should have taught them to handle such situations with more professionalism.\n"
