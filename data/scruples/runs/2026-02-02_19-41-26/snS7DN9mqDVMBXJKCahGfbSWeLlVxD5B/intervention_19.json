I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author was at a bar with friends, waiting for their food because it was busy. The server played \"keep away\" with their food, and the author got frustrated, swore, and told the server to give them their food. The author isn't drunk, just hungry after waiting a long time. The server then gave the food but the author's friends and the server looked at them weird.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. The user thinks they are in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The server's behavior: playing keep away. Is that acceptable? Probably not. Servers shouldn't play games with customers. The author was patient, waiting a long time, had two beers but not drunk. They were just hungry and frustrated. The author used a swear word but didn't become aggressive. The server's reaction was to stop smiling and give the food. The author has experience in service jobs and wouldn't do that to customers.\n\nSo, on one hand, the server was unprofessional. On the other, the author swore at them. The author might be in the wrong for using a harsh tone, even if provoked. But the server's actions were also unprofessional. Maybe the author's response was justified given the provocation. However, swearing at someone, even if they're being annoying, is generally considered rude. The author could have handled it more politely, like calmly asking for their food. But the server's behavior was the initial problem. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the server was in the wrong first, maybe the author's reaction is understandable but still not the right approach. But in terms of social norms, swearing at a server is usually frowned upon regardless of the situation. So the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more calmly. But maybe the server's actions were worse. \n\nHmm. The user's take is that the author is in the wrong. I think that's a reasonable perspective because even if the server was being annoying, swearing is impolite. However, the server's behavior was also unprofessional. But in terms of who's at fault, the customer is expected to treat staff with respect regardless. So even if the server was in the wrong, the author's response was still inappropriate. So answer A.\n"
