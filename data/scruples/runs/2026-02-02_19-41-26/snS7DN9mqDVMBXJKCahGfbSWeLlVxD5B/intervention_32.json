I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for swearing at the server. The situation is that the author was at a bar with friends, had been waiting a long time for food, and when the server gave the food to others but not the author, there was a brief game of \"keep away.\" The author then swore and demanded their food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was hungry, had been waiting a while, and was not drunk. The server, who was older, played a game with the food. The author, who has experience in service jobs, knows that this behavior from a server is unprofessional. The server's actions could be seen as teasing or inappropriate, possibly for their own amusement. The author's reaction was to swear and sternly demand the food. \n\nNow, the question is whether this reaction is justified. The key factors are the server's behavior and the author's response. If the server was intentionally delaying or teasing, the author might feel justified in confronting them. However, even in such cases, using a swear word might be seen as crossing a line. The author mentions that they would never do that to a customer, implying that they understand the inappropriateness of the server's actions. But the author's response, while understandable, could be seen as unprofessional or rude. \n\nIn service settings, even if the employee is being unprofessional, the customer's reaction can affect the situation. The server may have been trying to be playful, but the author's use of a curse word might escalate tension. The author might be in the wrong because they responded with a swear, which is more aggressive than necessary. However, if the server was indeed being unprofessional, the author's frustration is valid. \n\nBut considering the standard of right and wrong in such scenarios, the author's response, though understandable, is still a form of verbal aggression. Even if provoked, the appropriate response might have been to calmly ask for the food rather than using a curse. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
