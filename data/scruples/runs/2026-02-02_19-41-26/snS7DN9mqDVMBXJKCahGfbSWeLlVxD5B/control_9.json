I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food. The server withheld the food basket, making the author grab it, leading to a stern response.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The author mentions they were at a bar with friends, part of a regular group. The server's action was playful (\"keep away\"), not aggressive. The author had two beers but wasn't drunk or aggressive. They had experience in service jobs and wouldn't do that to a customer. \n\nThe key points here are the server's intent and the author's reaction. The server might have been trying to be humorous or create a memorable experience, which some people do in service roles. However, the author felt it was inconsiderate after waiting long and being hungry. They responded with a swear word, which is a strong reaction. \n\nBut since the server initiated the game, the author's response could be seen as reacting to the server's action. The question is whether the author overstepped. Swearing at someone, even in frustration, can come off as rude. However, if the server was being inconsiderate, the author might feel justified. \n\nThe answer depends on the server's intent. If the server was just being playful, the author might be overreacting. But if the server was actually being unprofessional and delaying service, the author has a point. The provided context says the server \"pulled back and smiled,\" which suggests it was a joke, not a refusal. So the author's reaction of swearing might be inappropriate because the server wasn't being malicious, just playful. \n\nGiven that the author was in a situation where they were hungry after a long wait, maybe their frustration was real. But the way they expressed it (swearing) is likely the issue here. Even if the server was playing, a customer is entitled to their food without games. The author's response might be seen as justified, but swearing could still be considered in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the server was being unprofessional, so the author isn't at fault. But the server's smile and the short duration of the keep away suggest it was a joke. So the author might have been right to be upset, but the swear word makes it their fault. \n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if the server was playing, the author's response was inappropriate. However, some might argue B if they see the server's action as unprofessional. But typically, such playful interactions are within the server's discretion, and reacting with a swear is crossing the line.\n"
