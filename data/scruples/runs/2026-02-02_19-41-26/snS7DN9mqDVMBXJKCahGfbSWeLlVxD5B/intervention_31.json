I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food. \n\nFirst, the author was at a busy bar and had waited a long time for their food. They had two beers but weren't drunk. When the server handed out the food, he pulled back when the author tried to grab their basket, which led the author to snap at him. The server then gave the food immediately after the outburst.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and appropriateness of response. The server's behavior of playing keep away isn't professional; servers are supposed to serve food, not play games. However, the author chose to respond with a swear word (\"give me my god damn food\") in a stern tone. Even if the server was at fault for the delay and the playful pulling back, the author's response was a verbal outburst. \n\nIn a service setting, customers are expected to handle frustration without swearing or aggression, even if they're upset. The author might have felt justified because they were hungry and had waited, but using a swear word in that context could be seen as inappropriate. The server might have been trying to be friendly or dealing with stress, but the author's response crossed a line. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have experience in service jobs and wouldn't do that to someone else, which implies they understand the importance of good service. Therefore, their own action, while understandable in frustration, is still unprofessional and impolite. \n\nSo, even though the server's actions were unprofessional, the author's response was not appropriate. Thus, the author is in the wrong.\n"
