I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a customer swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food. The author tried to get their food, but the server pulled back twice, leading to the customer saying, \"Give me my god damn food.\" The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The customer had been waiting a while, was hungry, and had two beers but wasn't drunk. The server, who was older (28 vs. the customer's 21), played a game with the food, which the customer found frustrating. The customer reacted with a stern statement involving a swear word. The server then complied, but the customer was judged by friends and the server.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The key points here are the customer's reaction and whether the server's actions were appropriate. \n\nFrom a service perspective, servers are expected to provide good service, which includes delivering food promptly and without games. The server's \"keep away\" behavior is unprofessional. The customer, despite waiting, was hungry and frustrated. However, using a swear word, even if not aggressive, is a form of disrespect. The customer had prior service experience, so might understand the impact of their words.\n\nBut the server's behavior was the initial issue. The customer's reaction, while inappropriate, might be seen as a response to provocation. However, the customer could have handled it differently, like asking politely instead of swearing. The fact that the customer was not drunk and had a history of service jobs suggests they know better, so their choice of words is more culpable.\n\nOn the other hand, the server's actions were unprofessional and could be seen as contributing to the situation. The customer's frustration was justified, but the method of addressing it wasn't. So, while the server is partly at fault, the customer's use of a swear word still makes them share the blame. \n\nThe question is whether the customer is \"in the wrong.\" Since the customer chose a confrontational approach despite the provocation, the answer might be A (Yes). However, some might argue that the server's behavior was the main issue. But since the customer's response was disrespectful, even if understandable, the answer is likely A.\n"
