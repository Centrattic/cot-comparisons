I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was at a bar with friends, part of a regular group. It was crowded, they waited a while, had two beers but weren't drunk. The server gave everyone else their food baskets but when it came to the author, the server pulled back, smiled, and the author tried to grab it again. After a short game, the author said, \"Give me my god damn food.\" The server then gave the food, but there were reactions from the server and friends.\n\nThe author's defense is that they were hungry, had waited a long time, weren't aggressive, and have worked in service jobs so know it's not acceptable. The server was 28, the author 21.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Swearing, even if in frustration, can be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful. The server's action of playing keep away might have been a prank or just a joke, but the author's response was to use a strong swear word. Even if the server was being playful, the customer's right to their food is clear. However, the way the author reacted with a swear could escalate the situation. The server might have been testing the customer's patience, but the customer's response is what could be seen as inappropriate. The fact that the author has service experience and knows the standards but still chose to swear might make it worse. So, the author might be in the wrong for using harsh language, even if provoked slightly. But maybe the server's actions were unprofessional too. However, the question is about the author's responsibility. So likely, the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
