I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is at a bar with an all-you-can-eat wings special. The person and their friends go there every Tuesday. It's crowded, so they understand the wait. They order food and drinks, wait a while, and after two beers (not drunk), the server starts playing \"keep away\" with their food. The server gives baskets to others but pulls back when handing it to the person, making them grab it again. The person gets frustrated, says \"Give me my god damn food\" sternly. The server stops and gives the food, but everyone looks weird. The question is whether the person is at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to decide A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, the server's behavior. The server is playing keep away, which is unprofessional. Maybe they were trying to be playful, but that's not appropriate in a service job. The server's job is to serve customers, not engage in games. Even if they thought it was a joke, it's unprofessional.\n\nThe customer had waited a long time, was hungry, and had two beers. They weren't drunk, just a bit frustrated. The server's actions led to the customer's outburst. The customer used a swear word but didn't act physically aggressive. The customer's job experience as a server makes them sensitive to this behavior. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for swearing? Well, the server's behavior was the trigger. The customer was trying to get their own food after a long wait. The server's actions were unprofessional first. The customer's reaction was a response to the server's playfulness. While swearing is rude, the root issue is the server's inappropriate behavior. The customer's frustration is understandable given the context. So, maybe the server is more at fault. However, the customer did swear, which is unkind, but perhaps not entirely their fault. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The server started the interaction by being unprofessional. The customer's reaction, while using a swear word, was a result of the server's actions. So the server is more in the wrong, but the customer's response is still somewhat their fault. However, the server's behavior was the catalyst. The customer was trying to assert their right to their food after being unreasonably kept waiting. \n\nIn service interactions, customers should handle frustration calmly. But the server's actions were inappropriate. The customer's outburst might be seen as a justified reaction to the server's unprofessionalism. However, the customer still shouldn't have sworn. So it's a mix, but the server is more to blame. However, the question is about the customer's wrongdoing. The customer did lose their temper, but the server's actions were the main issue. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they chose to swear, even if provoked. But maybe some would argue the server was more at fault. But the question is about the author's actions. Swearing is generally considered rude, so the author is wrong for that. Even though the server's behavior was worse, the author's response still makes them at fault.\n"
