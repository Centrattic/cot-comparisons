I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author swearing at a server who played \"keep away\" with their food during a crowded night. The author admits they said \"Give me my god damn food\" sternly when the server pulled back the food twice. They mention they were not drunk, just hungry after waiting a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The server was playing a game, which might be unprofessional, but the author responded with a swear word. Is that an appropriate reaction? The server was 28, and the author is 21, but that doesn't necessarily matter. The key issue is the use of the swear word and the tone.\n\nThe author claims they were not aggressive, just hungry. But using a phrase like \"god damn\" is a swear word. Even if the server was being playful, the customer's response could be seen as rude. The server's action, while possibly unprofessional, might be a minor issue. However, the customer's reaction is the main point here. \n\nIn service industries, customers are expected to handle situations calmly. Swearing at a server, even if the server is at fault, is generally considered inappropriate. The author could have addressed it without the profanity. The friends and server's reaction (looking weird) suggests that the response was out of line. \n\nSo, while the server's behavior might not be entirely blameless, the author's use of a swear word and stern tone is more likely the main issue here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
