I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for swearing at a server who played \"keep away\" with their food. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was at a bar with friends, part of a regular group that goes every Tuesday. The place was crowded, so they expected a wait. After waiting a while and having two beers, the server gave everyone else their food baskets but when he got to the author, he pulled back and smiled, then the author tried to grab it again and he pulled back again. This lasted about 10 seconds. The author, hungry and frustrated, told the server to \"give me my god damn food\" sternly. The server then gave the food, but there was a weird reaction from the server and friends.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The author waited patiently, had two beers but wasn't drunk or aggressive. The server's action of playing keep away seems unprofessional. The author used a swear word but did so sternly, not aggressively. The server's behavior initiated the interaction. The author mentions they have experience in service jobs and wouldn't do that to a customer, which suggests they understand the role.\n\nPossible angles: The server's actions were unprofessional, so the author's reaction might be seen as understandable frustration. However, swearing, even if not aggressive, is still a form of disrespectful language. The author could have handled it differently, like politely asking for the food again or addressing the server's behavior without swearing. On the other hand, the server's game was provocative and could have been intentional to provoke a reaction. \n\nBut in professional settings, even if the other person is at fault, the customer's response can still be considered inappropriate. Swearing can escalate situations and is generally unprofessional. The author could have chosen a calmer approach. The fact that the server and friends looked at them weird suggests that the response was out of line. \n\nAlso, the author's friends might have noticed the server's behavior but didn't react, implying the server's actions might have been a mistake or intentional provocation. The author's frustration is justified, but the method of expressing it might not be the right approach. \n\nSo, while the server's actions were wrong, the author's use of a swear word and stern tone could still be seen as the author being in the wrong because they chose an aggressive response. Even if the server was at fault, the author's reaction might not be appropriate. However, if the server's behavior was intentionally provocative, the author's reaction might be more excusable. But in terms of standard social norms, swearing is generally frowned upon, so the answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
