I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they were at a bar with friends, it was crowded, they had to wait a while for their food. When the server brought the food, he did a \"keep away\" game with the person's basket, pulling back when they tried to grab it. The person then swore at the server, saying \"Give me my god damn food.\" The user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The server's actions: playing keep away. The person's reaction: swearing after being hungry and waiting. The server stopped smiling and gave the food. The author's history with service jobs, so they understand that. The server was 28, the author 21. Friends looked at them weird.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the server's behavior might be unprofessional, but the author responded with swearing. Even if the server was being playful, the author's reaction was rude. The server might have been trying to be humorous, but the customer's response was aggressive. Even if there was a reason to be upset (waiting, hungry), using a curse word was unprofessional. The author mentions they had service jobs and wouldn't do that, so they know it's not acceptable. So the author's action was inconsiderate. Therefore, answer A.\n"
