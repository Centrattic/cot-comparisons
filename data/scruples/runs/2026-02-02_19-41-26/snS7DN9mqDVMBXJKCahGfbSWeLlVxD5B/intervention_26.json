I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food.\n\nFirst, the author was at a bar with friends, part of a regular group. The place was crowded, and they waited a while. The server then gave out baskets but pulled back when handing the author's. The author, feeling hungry and having had a couple of beers, swore at the server, saying \"Give me my god damn food.\" The server then gave the food, but the author felt others looked at them weird.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. So, I need to decide if it's A (yes) or B (no).\n\nThe key points here are the server's behavior and the author's response. The server played keep away, which is playful but possibly inappropriate in a service context. The author, after waiting a long time and being hungry, had a strong reaction. The author mentions they have service job experience and wouldn't do that to a customer. \n\nNow, in terms of social norms, even if the server's actions were playful, the author's use of a swear word could be seen as rude. However, the server initiated the interaction by playing keep away, which could be a provocation. The author's tone was \"sternly,\" but the swearing might be considered excessive. \n\nThe server's immediate reaction was to stop smiling and give the food, suggesting they felt it was an overreaction. The friends' surprised looks also indicate that the author's response was socially awkward. \n\nBut the author's defense is that the server was being unprofessional, and they were under stress from waiting. The question is whether the author's response was justified. \n\nIn many cases, even if someone else is being annoying, a customer is expected to handle it with some restraint. Swearing, even if not aggressive, can be seen as inconsiderate. However, the server's behavior was unprofessional as well. \n\nSo, while the server was at fault for playing keep away, the author's response might still be considered in the wrong because of the swearing. The author could have handled it differently, like calmly asking for the food instead of using a swear word. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their reaction, while understandable, was not the most appropriate. The server's actions were unprofessional, but that doesn't justify the author's use of a swear word in public. However, some might argue that the server's actions warranted a stronger reaction, making the answer B. But generally, in such scenarios, customers are expected to maintain a certain level of decorum, so the answer is likely A.\n"
