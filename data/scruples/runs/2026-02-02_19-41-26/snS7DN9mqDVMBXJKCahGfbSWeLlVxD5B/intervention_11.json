I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food. The situation happened at a crowded bar where the group waited a while for their order. The server handed out baskets to others but when it came to the author, he played a game by pulling back and smiling, prompting the author to snap and use a swear word.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was hungry, had waited a long time, and had only had two beers, so not drunk. The server's behavior seems unprofessional and possibly mean-spirited, especially since the author mentions that servers in service jobs wouldn't do that. However, the author's response was to swear, which is a form of verbal aggression. \n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, even if the server was being playful, the author's reaction was to yell and use a swear word. That could be seen as inappropriate. The server might have been trying to be humorous, but it's not an excuse for the author to respond with hostility. Service jobs are tough, and servers often deal with difficult customers. The author's tone was stern, which might have crossed a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the server's actions were unprofessional. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Swearing at an employee, regardless of the situation, is generally considered rude. The author could have handled it by calmly asking for the food or speaking to a manager if the server's behavior was inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because using a swear word in a stern manner is not an appropriate response, even if the server acted unprofessionally. There are better ways to address the issue without resorting to swearing.\n"
