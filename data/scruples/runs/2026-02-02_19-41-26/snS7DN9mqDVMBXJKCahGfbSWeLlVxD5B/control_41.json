I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for swearing at the server. So, the situation: the person was at a bar with friends, they were waiting a long time for their food. The server was playing keep-away with their basket of wings. The author, hungry and after two beers (but not drunk), told the server to give them their food with some swearing. The server then gave the food but the author's friends and the server looked at them weird.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions were wrong. The key points here are the context and the actions taken. The author mentions they were patient, had waited a long time, and weren't aggressive or drunk. The server's behavior of playing keep-away is unprofessional and possibly rude. The author, in frustration, used a swear word to assert their right to the food they paid for. \n\nBut is swearing at a server ever acceptable? Well, even if the server acted unprofessionally, the author's response was a verbal outburst with a swear word. While the server's actions might have been annoying, responding with a curse word could be seen as rude or disrespectful. The author's history in service jobs suggests they understand the challenges, so maybe they should have handled it differently, like calmly asking for the food instead of using a harsh tone. \n\nHowever, the author's friends and the server's reaction might indicate that the author overstepped, even if the server was at fault. The author might have contributed to a tense situation by swearing, which could be seen as unprofessional or aggressive regardless of the server's behavior. So, while the server's actions were inappropriate, the author's response might still be considered wrong because using profanity in such a situation is generally discouraged. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if the server was at fault, swearing is not an appropriate response and could escalate the situation unnecessarily.\n"
