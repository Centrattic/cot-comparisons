I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for swearing at their server. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author was at a bar during a crowded time, waiting for their food. The server played \"keep away\" with their order, leading to the author snapping and using a strong expletive. The server then gave them the food.\n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The server's actions (pulling the food back with a smile) could be seen as playful or maybe a bit of a joke, but it's also a bit unprofessional. The author was hungry, had been waiting a while, and was not drunk. They used a curse word, which is definitely aggressive, even if their tone was stern. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The server's behavior might have been inappropriate, but the author's response was to swear at them. Even if the server was to blame for the game, the author could have handled it better. Using a swear word, especially in a public setting, could be seen as unprofessional and disrespectful. The server might have been trying to be humorous, but the author's reaction escalated the situation. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have worked in service jobs and wouldn't do that, implying they understand the job's demands. So they should know that such behavior from a customer is not acceptable. Even if the server was being a bit of a jerk, the customer's response is still a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the server's actions might have been inconsiderate, but the author's reaction was a moment of frustration. However, the use of a swear word is a clear violation of professional conduct. The author could have asked for the food politely or brought up the issue with a manager. Swearing at the server is a direct attack on them, which is unkind regardless of the situation. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because they chose to respond with aggression and a curse word, which is inappropriate even if the server was being unprofessional. The answer should be A.\n"
