I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was at a bar with friends, they ordered food, and the server played a little game of keeping the food away. The author, after some waiting and being hungry, swore at the server, saying \"Give me my god damn food.\" Now they're asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The server was playing \"keep away,\" which sounds like a childish or teasing action. The author was in a hurry, had waited a long time, and was hungry. They were not drunk or aggressive, just frustrated. The server's behavior might have been inappropriate, especially if they were trying to be playful but it came off as unprofessional.\n\nBut even so, the author responded with a swear word. Using profanity in public, even when frustrated, can be seen as unprofessional and disrespectful. The server might have been trying to add some light-heartedness, but the author's reaction could be seen as over the top. However, the server's actions might have contributed to the situation. The author has experience in service jobs, so they understand the importance of good service, but they were the customer here. \n\nIn customer service scenarios, customers can sometimes push the limits, but there's an expectation of mutual respect. Swearing at a server, even in frustration, is generally not acceptable. It's a form of verbal abuse and can create a hostile environment. The server's response was to stop smiling and give the food, which suggests they felt disrespected. The friends also looked at the author weird, indicating that the reaction was out of line.\n\nOn the other hand, the server's \"keep away\" behavior might have been a mistake. If they were being unprofessional, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the appropriate response would be to voice the complaint calmly, not to use a swear word. The author acknowledges that they were not drunk or aggressive, so it's about handling frustration.\n\nSo, even if the server was partly at fault, the author's response of swearing is still in the wrong. It's about how you address the issue. The answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
