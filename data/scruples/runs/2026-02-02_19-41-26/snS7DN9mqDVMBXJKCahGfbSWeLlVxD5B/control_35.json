I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author swearing at a server who played \"keep away\" with their food. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was at a bar with friends, part of a regular group. The place was crowded, so they were told it might take time. They waited, had two beers but weren't drunk. When the food arrived, the server handed out baskets to everyone except the author, playfully pulling back each time they tried to grab it. After a short ten-second game, the author snaps and says \"Give me my god damn food.\" The server then gives the food, but others looked at the author weird.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are intent, context, and proportionality. The server's actions might be seen as playful or trying to be funny, especially since they smiled. The author was hungry, had waited a long time, and was frustrated. The server's behavior, while not hostile, could be perceived as teasing or unprofessional, especially in a service setting where promptness is expected.\n\nThe author's response was a stern comment with a swear word. The question is whether this was a reasonable reaction. Factors to consider: Was there provocation? The server's actions, while not aggressive, might have been annoying. The author's tone was stern but not aggressive, given they were just frustrated. The server's immediate reaction (stopping smiling and giving the food) suggests they felt the comment was harsh or out of line.\n\nIn service roles, there's an expectation that servers will be professional and not engage in childish behavior with customers. Playfully withholding food isn't appropriate. The author's frustration after waiting a long time is understandable. However, using a swear word in public, even when frustrated, might be seen as unprofessional or rude, regardless of the server's actions. On the other hand, the server's behavior first could be seen as unprofessional, leading to the author's reaction.\n\nThe fact that the author has worked in service jobs and wouldn't do that to a customer suggests they understand the other side. However, the server might not have been aware that their actions were inconsiderate. The author's response, while direct, might be justified if they felt the server was deliberately delaying them. But using a swear word in public could be seen as inconsiderate to others, even if the server was at fault.\n\nSo, considering both sides: The server's actions were unprofessional, leading to the author's frustration. The author's response was a direct reaction to that unprofessionalism but used a swear word. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the swear word was an appropriate response. Some might say the author had a right to be upset and the server's behavior warranted a firm response. Others might argue that using a swear word in public is inappropriate regardless. The author's tone was stern but not aggressive, and they were not drunk. The server's action was playful but unprofessional. \n\nIn conclusion, the server's behavior was the initial issue, but the author's reaction, while understandable, included a swear word which might be seen as inconsiderate. However, given the context and the server's provocation, it's a close call. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations. But since the author was not aggressive and the server's actions were unprofessional, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. So the answer could be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. Alternatively, since using a swear word is generally frowned upon in public, maybe A, but the server's actions contributed. Given the options, I think the answer is B.\n"
