I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a server playing \"keep away\" with their food after a long wait. The author, who had been waiting patiently and wasn't drunk, ended up swearing at the server when they pulled back the food twice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the server's actions. If the server was intentionally playing games with the customer's food, that's unprofessional and inappropriate. However, sometimes servers might have a playful or teasing manner, which could be seen as inappropriate in a service setting. The key here is whether the server's actions were malicious or just a joke gone too far.\n\nThe author mentions they were hungry, had waited a long time, and were not intoxicated. They were stern but didn't act physically aggressive. The server's reaction was to stop smiling and give the food, and the friends were surprised. The author's response was a direct reaction to being played with after waiting. \n\nNow, considering the social norms and expectations in a service environment. Customers are supposed to treat servers respectfully, regardless of the server's behavior. Even if the server's actions were inappropriate, the customer's response with a curse word might be seen as crossing a line. But if the server was acting in a way that was clearly provoking, the customer might feel justified in their reaction.\n\nHowever, the author's job experience in service might make them more sensitive to such behavior from servers. They mention they wouldn't do that to customers, implying they understand the professional expectation. But in this case, the server's actions were unprofessional, and the customer's frustration led to a stern response.\n\nThe main point is whether swearing at the server, even in response to their behavior, is acceptable. Typically, escalating with a curse word is not considered appropriate, even if the server was being unprofessional. The customer could have addressed it calmly or reported the behavior later. Reacting with a stern, swear-laden comment might be seen as the customer being in the wrong, as they're the ones paying for the service and should maintain composure.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if the server's behavior was unprofessional, the customer's response was not appropriate. However, some might argue that the server's actions justified the customer's reaction. But in standard social etiquette, customers are expected to handle such situations with more restraint.\n"
