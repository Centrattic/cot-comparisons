I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person (AITA) was wrong for swearing at their server when the server played \"keep away\" with their food.\n\nFirst, context is important. The person was at a bar with friends, part of a regular group that goes every Tuesday. It was crowded, and they waited a while for their food. The server handed out baskets but pulled back when giving the AITA's food, leading to a brief game of \"keep away.\" The AITA then said, \"Give me my god damn food,\" sternly. They mention they weren't drunk, just hungry, and had experience in service jobs, so they understand the server's job.\n\nNow, the key elements here are: the server's actions (playing keep away), the AITA's reaction (swearing), and the context (hungry, waited a while, not intoxicated). \n\nThe server's behavior, while not necessarily malicious, was unprofessional. Playing keep away with a customer's food is inappropriate and could be seen as a childish or rude action, especially in a service setting. The AITA was within their right to express frustration, given the wait and the server's conduct. However, the use of a swear word might have been a misstep, even if the situation was frustrating.\n\nBut considering the server's actions were the catalyst, the AITA's response, while using a swear word, seems to be a justified reaction to being mocked or treated disrespectfully. The AITA also clarifies they weren't aggressive and that the incident was brief. Their background in service jobs suggests they understand the importance of professional conduct, which might make the server's actions even more egregious.\n\nIn terms of accountability, both parties have some responsibility. The server shouldn't have played games with the customer's order. The AITA could have handled the situation without swearing, but the server's actions were the root cause. Since the AITA's response was a direct result of the server's unprofessional behavior and their frustration from waiting, it's debatable whether they were entirely in the wrong. However, the question is whether the AITA is in the wrong. The server's actions were inappropriate, so the AITA's frustration is understandable. The swear word was a reaction to provocation. In this context, I think the AITA isn't entirely in the wrong because the server's behavior was the main issue, and the AITA was defending their right to receive their food without being mocked.\n"
