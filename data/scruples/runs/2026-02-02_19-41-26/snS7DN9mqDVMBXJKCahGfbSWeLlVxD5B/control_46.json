I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author was at a bar with friends, had an all-you-can-eat wings deal. They waited a long time, and when the server gave out the food, he pulled back when the author tried to grab it. The author got frustrated and swore, saying \"Give me my god damn food.\" Now, they're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was patient, waited a while, and was hungry. They mention they had two beers but weren't drunk or aggressive. The server played \"keep away\" with the food, which could be seen as a game or maybe a joke. The author, frustrated, used a swear word to get their food. The server stopped smiling and gave the food right after.\n\nNow, the key points here: The server's action might have been playful or teasing, but from the author's perspective, it was frustrating. The author used a swear word, which is a strong reaction. The server was older (28) and the author is 21. Also, the author has worked in service jobs and wouldn't do that to customers.\n\nIn terms of social norms, swearing at someone, even if you're frustrated, can be seen as inappropriate. The server might have been just messing around, but the author's response could come off as rude or aggressive. However, the server's action of playing keep away might have been the catalyst. The friends were there, and they looked at the author weird, which suggests that maybe the author overreacted.\n\nBut the author was in a situation where they had been waiting a long time and were hungry. The server's actions could have been perceived as unprofessional, especially since the author mentions service workers they know wouldn't do that. So maybe the server was being unprofessional, which led to the author's frustration.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author did use a swear word, which is a form of disrespect. However, the server's actions might have contributed. The question is whether the author's reaction was justified. Some might say the server was being unprofessional, and the author had a right to be frustrated. Others might say that swearing is never acceptable, regardless of the situation.\n\nBut in the framework of \"Am I the asshole,\" it's about whether the person did something wrong. The server's action might be part of the problem, but the author's response was to swear, which is a direct confrontation. Since the author didn't escalate further, like being physically aggressive, maybe it's a minor issue. However, the use of a swear word is a form of disrespect. The answer might depend on cultural context too. In some places, swearing is more tolerated in casual settings, but in others, it's not.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they reacted with a swear word, even if provoked. The server's action was unprofessional, but the author's response was unprofessional as well. However, since the server initiated the \"keep away,\" there's a shared responsibility. But the question is about the author's wrongness. In many cases, people are expected to handle frustration without swearing. So the answer might be A (yes, at fault) because the author chose an inappropriate response. But others might argue the server was at fault for playing keep away. However, the question is about the author specifically. So likely, the answer is A.\n"
