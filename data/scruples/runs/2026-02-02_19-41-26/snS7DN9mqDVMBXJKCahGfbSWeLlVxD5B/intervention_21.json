I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a customer swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food. The person says they were hungry, had waited a long time, and were not drunk. They used a harsh phrase but claim they didn't mean to be aggressive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The server was playing a game, which might be a way to relieve stress or just being playful. However, the customer's reaction involved swearing, even if it was stern and not aggressive. The key points are: the customer was not under the influence, the server's action was a game, and the customer's response was a swear word. \n\nFrom a customer service perspective, employees are trained to handle difficult customers, but customers are also expected to treat staff with respect. Even if the server was teasing, the customer's use of a swear word could be seen as inappropriate. The customer's history of working in service jobs might make them aware of the difficulties, so their reaction could be considered unprofessional or disrespectful.\n\nBut the customer had been waiting a long time and was hungry. They might have felt frustrated. However, swearing, even if not physically aggressive, is a form of disrespect. The server might have just been having fun, but the customer's response could have escalated the situation. \n\nIn many cases, people are expected to manage their frustration without using profanity. The customer's statement that they wouldn't do that to someone in a service job suggests they know it's wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using a swear word in that situation, even if the server's actions were playful.\n"
