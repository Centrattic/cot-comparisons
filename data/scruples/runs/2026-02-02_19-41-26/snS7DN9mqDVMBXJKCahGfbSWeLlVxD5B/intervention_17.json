I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they were at a bar with friends, had an all-you-can-eat wings deal. The server played \"keep away\" with their food, so they swore at him. The user is 21, the server is 28. The user has worked in service jobs before and wouldn't do that to a customer.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the user's actions were justified. The key points are the server's behavior and the user's response. The server was playing a game with the food, which is unprofessional. The user was hungry, had waited a long time, and two beers (but not drunk). They said, \"Give me my god damn food.\" sternly. The server then gave them the food but looked shocked.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? The user was provoked by the server's unprofessional behavior. However, even if provoked, swearing at a server is not appropriate. The user could have handled it differently, maybe by asking politely or confronting the server calmly. Swearing, even if in frustration, is a form of disrespect. The fact that the user has worked in service jobs and wouldn't do that to a customer suggests they know the right way, so their response was unprofessional. The server's actions were wrong, but the user's response was also wrong. Therefore, the user is in the wrong.\n"
