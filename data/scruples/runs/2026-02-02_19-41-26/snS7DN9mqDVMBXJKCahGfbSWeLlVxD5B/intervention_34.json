I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food. The situation is that the author was at a bar with friends, waiting for their all-you-can-eat wings. The server delayed giving the food by playing keep away, and the author, after being hungry and waiting a while, snapped and told the server to give the food, using a swear word. The server then gave the food but everyone looked at the author weird.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was not drunk, just had two beers, so their judgment wasn't impaired. They were in a crowded place, waiting a long time, and the server's behavior was playful (smiling and pulling back). The author felt frustrated and used a swear word. The server stopped smiling and gave the food, but others were surprised.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author was in the wrong. The server's actions could be seen as unprofessional or inappropriate, even if it was a joke. But the customer has the right to express dissatisfaction. However, using a swear word might be seen as crossing a line. Even if the server was at fault, the author's response was confrontational. The customer's responsibility is to handle the situation calmly, perhaps by politely asking for the food or escalating to a manager. Swearing in public, even if justified by the situation, can be seen as rude or aggressive.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the server was being unprofessional. If the server was indeed playing games, that's their fault. However, the author's response might have been an overreaction. The tone of the question is seeking validation, but the user already thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The server's behavior was wrong, but the author's reaction was also unprofessional. However, the server was in a position of service, so the author might have a right to be firm. But the swear word makes it more likely the author is in the wrong. So answer A for yes.\n"
