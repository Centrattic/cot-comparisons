I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food. The situation is that the server kept pulling back the food when the author tried to grab it. The author was at a bar, had two beers, was hungry after waiting a long time, and said, \"Give me my god damn food.\" The server then gave the food, but everyone looked at the author weird.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a crowded place and had waited a while. They were not drunk, just hungry. The server's action of playing keep away could be seen as a prank or a test, maybe to see how the customer would react. The author's reaction was a stern comment with a swear word. The server stopped smiling and handed over the food.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, swearing at someone, even if they initiated a playful action, might be considered inappropriate. However, the server's behavior could be seen as provoking. The author was trying to get their food, which they had paid for, and after waiting a long time. The use of a swear word might be seen as a justified outburst in frustration, especially considering the circumstances. However, the author could have handled it more politely. The server might not have realized their actions were causing frustration, and the author's response could have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nBut in the Reddit \"Am I the Asshole\" format, people often weigh in on whether the person's actions were inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author's response was proportional. The server was playing a game, which is unprofessional, but the customer's response with swearing might be seen as crossing a line. However, the server was a bit older (28) and the author is 21, and the author has experience in service jobs, implying they understand the pressure but also the unprofessional conduct. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the server's actions were unprofessional, and the customer was right to demand their food. Others might say the swearing was unnecessary. The friends looking weird suggests that the reaction was unexpected and perhaps over the top. So, the author could be in the wrong for swearing, even if the server's actions were inappropriate. Alternatively, the server's behavior was the real issue, and the customer's frustration was understandable, making the author not in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a bit of a toss-up, but in most cases, using a swear word in public, even when frustrated, might be considered unprofessional or inconsiderate. The author could have asked for the food without swearing. So, the answer might lean towards \"Yes\" (A), but I'm not entirely sure. However, the server's provocation might mitigate some of the blame. Still, the author's choice of words is the main issue here. So, probably A.\n"
