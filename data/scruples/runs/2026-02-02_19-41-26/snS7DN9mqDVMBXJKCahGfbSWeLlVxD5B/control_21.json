I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author was at a bar with friends, they ordered all-you-can-eat wings, and the server played \"keep away\" with their food. The author, after waiting a while and being hungry, swore at the server by saying \"Give me my god damn food.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the server pulled back the food twice when the author tried to grab it. The server was smiling, which might indicate it was a playful or teasing action. The author was hungry, had been waiting a long time, and was not drunk. They have experience in service jobs and wouldn't do that to a customer. \n\nNow, the key points here are the server's actions. If the server was just playing around and the author felt justified in their frustration, is the author wrong for expressing that frustration? On one hand, swearing at someone, even if they were being annoying, could be seen as unprofessional or rude. On the other hand, the server's behavior might have been inconsiderate, leading to the author's outburst.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author overreacted. The server's actions were probably meant as a joke, but if they made the customer wait longer or were disrespectful, that's a problem. However, the author's response was to swear, which could be seen as inappropriate regardless of the situation. Even if the server was playing around, using a swear word and being stern might be crossing a line. The author could have addressed it calmly, maybe by asking the server to stop or bringing it up after the food was given.\n\nAlso, the author's background in service jobs suggests they know how to treat customers, so their own behavior might be a contrast to their professional experience. The friends looking at them weirdly might indicate that the outburst was unexpected or not socially acceptable in that context.\n\nIn terms of accountability, even if the server was at fault for the \"keep away,\" the author's response of swearing is still a form of verbal aggression. It's possible that the server was just being playful, but the author's reaction could be perceived as aggressive. The author might have had a right to be frustrated, but the method of addressing it could be questioned. So, while the server's actions were unprofessional, the author's response might also be considered inappropriate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author used a swear word and a stern tone, that's likely to be seen as their fault, even if the server contributed. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
