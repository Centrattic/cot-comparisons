I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for swearing at the server when the server played \"keep away\" with their food. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to figure out which one is more accurate.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The person went to a bar with friends for an all-you-can-eat wings special. It was crowded, and they waited a while. When the food arrived, the server gave baskets to others but pulled back when handing it to the author. The author, who had two beers but wasn't drunk, got frustrated and said, \"Give me my god damn food,\" sternly. The server then gave the food, but everyone was surprised. The author has a history of working in service jobs and wouldn't do that to others.\n\nSo, the author is defensive, mentioning that they understand the wait and weren't drunk. They also justify their behavior by saying they've been in service jobs before. The question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Swearing in a public place, even if frustrated, is generally considered rude. The server's action of \"keep away\" seems playful, but the customer's response was to swear. Even if the server was teasing, the customer's tone was harsh. The author was hungry and had waited, but using a curse word might be seen as crossing a line. However, the context includes that the server was acting playful, so maybe the customer's reaction was a bit over the top.\n\nOn the other hand, the server's behavior might have been unprofessional, playing games with the customer's food. If the server was being a jerk, the customer might have felt justified. But the story says the server smiled and pulled back, which could be seen as a joke. The customer's response was a stern swear, which is a strong reaction. The author's history in service jobs suggests they understand the importance of customer service, so they might know that such behavior is unprofessional.\n\nHowever, the customer was in a situation where they were waiting a long time and had a right to be frustrated. The server's playfulness might have been a mistake. But the customer's use of a swear word is likely to be seen as inconsiderate, especially in a public setting. The friends being surprised also indicate that the reaction was unexpected and perhaps too harsh.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, even if someone is frustrated, swearing at a server is generally considered inappropriate. The server might have been unprofessional, but the customer's response escalated the situation. The author might not have handled it the best, even if the server was at fault. So, the author is in the wrong because their reaction, while understandable in frustration, was rude and unprofessional. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
