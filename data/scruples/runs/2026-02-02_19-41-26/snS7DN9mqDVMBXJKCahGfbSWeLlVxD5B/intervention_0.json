I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of that story is in the wrong for swearing at the server. They provided the story where the author was at a bar, waiting a long time for their food. The server played \"keep away\" with the food, leading the author to swear at them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author says they weren't drunk, just hungry after waiting a long time. The server pulled back the food twice, smiling, which the author found annoying. The author used a curse word but in a stern voice, not aggressive. The server then handed over the food and there was some awkwardness.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author had experience in service jobs and wouldn't do that to customers. The server was 28, the author 21. The key points here are the server's behavior and the author's reaction. \n\nThe server's actions\u2014smiling while withholding food\u2014could be seen as unprofessional. Maybe they were playing around, but that's not appropriate in a service role. The author was hungry, had waited a while, and was stressed. Their reaction was a direct response to the server's behavior. \n\nBut the author did use a swear word, which is the main issue. Even if provoked, using profanity is generally considered rude. The server might have been testing the author's patience, but that doesn't justify swearing. The author's friends and the server's reaction indicate that it was out of line. \n\nHowever, the author's tone was \"sternly,\" not aggressive. They weren't violent, just angry. The server's initial behavior was unprofessional, which could have led to the author's reaction. But in a service setting, customers are expected to handle delays politely. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The server's actions were unprofessional, but the customer still has a responsibility to behave respectfully. Swearing is a breach of decorum, even if provoked. The author's history in service jobs should make them understand the stress, but maybe they were just too hungry. \n\nThe answer probably leans towards A (in the wrong) because using a swear word is generally considered inappropriate, regardless of the provocation. But there's a bit of gray area because the server's behavior was also unprofessional. However, the question is about the author's actions. Since they used a curse word, which is a clear violation, they are more in the wrong.\n"
