I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a bar where the author was at an all-you-can-eat wings special. The server was playing \"keep away\" with the food, and the author swore at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was hungry, had been waiting a long time, and had a couple of beers but wasn't drunk. The server pulled back the food twice, leading the author to lash out with a swear word. The key points here are the server's actions and the author's response.\n\nThe server's behavior\u2014smiling and playing keep away\u2014could be seen as unprofessional. Waitstaff are supposed to serve customers, not tease them. However, the author chose to respond with a stern, swearing remark. Even if the server was being playful, the author's reaction involved swearing, which can be considered disrespectful.\n\nBut the author mentions they had service jobs and wouldn't do that to a customer. So they understand the perspective of the server. Still, the act of swearing at someone, regardless of the provocation, might be seen as inappropriate. The question is whether the server's actions justified the author's response.\n\nAlso, the author was in a group, and their friends looked at them weird. That suggests their reaction was out of line in the social context. The server stopped smiling and gave the food, possibly due to the author's tone. But the use of a swear word (\"god damn\") could be considered unprofessional or rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the server's actions were inconsiderate. The author had a right to be upset after waiting a long time. However, the appropriate response would be to politely ask for the food rather than using a profane expression. So even if the server was being playful, the author's choice of words might have been excessive.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author's action of swearing was inappropriate, even if the server's behavior was unprofessional. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
