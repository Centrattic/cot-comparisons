I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the person was at a bar with friends, waiting for their food. The server was playing \"keep away\" by pulling back the food when they tried to take it. The person then swore at the server, saying \"Give me my god damn food.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The server was playing a game, which the author found annoying. The person was hungry, had waited a long time, and had two beers but wasn't drunk. The author used a swear word. The server stopped smiling and gave the food, but everyone looked at the person strangely.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here: the server's action (playing keep away) is unprofessional and possibly inappropriate. The customer was patient and waited a long time. The author's response was a stern, swearing-laced statement. The server's behavior might have been a joke, but in a professional setting, that's not acceptable. The customer's reaction, while using a swear word, was in response to the server's provocation. \n\nOn one hand, the customer used a harsh phrase, which could be seen as rude. On the other hand, the server's actions were unprofessional and possibly intentional to amuse others, which could justify the customer's frustration. \n\nIn service industries, employees are expected to maintain professionalism, and customers are expected to handle situations with some decorum. However, if the server was being deliberately annoying, the customer's frustration is understandable. The use of a swear word, though, may have been an unnecessary escalation. The author could have asked politely or pointed out the unprofessional behavior without swearing. \n\nSo, while the server's actions were wrong, the customer's response included a swear word, which is typically considered unprofessional in such contexts. Therefore, the customer might be in the wrong for using that language, even if provoked. However, the server's behavior also contributed to the situation. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the answer often hinges on whether the person's actions were inconsiderate or inappropriate. The author did use a swear word, which is usually a red flag. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure not to overlook the server's role. However, the core question is the customer's actions. The server's behavior was unprofessional, but the customer's response crossed a line. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
