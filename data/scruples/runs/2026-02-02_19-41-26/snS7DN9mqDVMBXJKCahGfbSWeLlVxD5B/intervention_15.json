I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a customer swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The customer was at a bar with friends, had been waiting a long time for their food. The server handed out baskets to others but when it came to the customer, the server pulled back and smiled, then the customer grabbed again, and the server did it again. The customer, who had had two beers (but claims not drunk or aggressive), shouted \"Give me my god damn food.\" The server then gave the food, but everyone looked at the customer weird.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nSo, to determine this, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The server's behavior of playing keep away is unprofessional. Servers are supposed to provide service without games, so that's on them. The customer, after waiting, got frustrated and swore. The customer mentions they have had service jobs and would never do that to a customer, indicating they know the service industry's expectations.\n\nBut the customer used a swear word and was stern. Even if the server was at fault, the customer's response was rude. However, the customer's tone might have been a reaction to the server's unprofessional behavior. The key here is whether the customer's response was justified. Since the server was acting inappropriately, maybe the customer's frustration is understandable, but swearing is still unprofessional and could be seen as inconsiderate. But in terms of right or wrong, the server started the unprofessional act. The customer's response, while rude, might be a reaction to being treated poorly. However, the customer's actions (swearing) are still their responsibility. So even if the server was in the wrong, the customer's response is also in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes), the author is in the wrong. But wait, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. But maybe some people would say the server was in the wrong for playing keep away, so the customer's reaction is justified. But in terms of general etiquette, even if provoked, swearing is not acceptable. So the answer is A.\n"
