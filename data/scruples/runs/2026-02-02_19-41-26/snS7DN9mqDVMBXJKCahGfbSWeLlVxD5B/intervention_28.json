I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was at a crowded bar with friends, waited a long time for food. When the server finally brought the food, he pulled back when the author tried to take it, leading to a brief game of keep-away. The author, frustrated and hungry, then swore at the server. The server then gave the food, and everyone was surprised.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author was not drunk, just had two beers. They were patient, but the server's actions were unprofessional. The author's response was a stern swear, which is unkind, but was it warranted?\n\nThe server's behavior is questionable. Playing keep-away with food is not standard, and it could be seen as a power play or a joke taken too far. The author had waited a long time, so frustration is understandable. However, responding with a swear, even if not aggressive, is a form of disrespect. The author mentions they've worked in service jobs, so they should know how it feels on the other side. That suggests they understand the impact of such language.\n\nBut was the server's action justifiable? Probably not. The server shouldn't be playing games during their job. The author's frustration is valid, but the response might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the server was being unprofessional, the author's reaction might be a justified response to that unprofessionalism.\n\nHowever, the act of swearing at someone, even in frustration, is a breach of courtesy. The author might not have been in the wrong if the server was being unreasonable, but using a swear word in a public setting could be seen as inappropriate regardless. The friends' reaction of looking weird suggests that the tone was off.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they chose to respond with an outburst, even if the server's actions were inappropriate. The server's behavior was unprofessional, but the author's response was also unkind. However, the server's actions were more unprofessional. But in terms of right and wrong, the author's swear might be the lesser wrong compared to the server's actions. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they used an aggressive tone and swear words, even if not physically aggressive, it's a social transgression. So I lean towards A, but it's a bit of a gray area. The server's behavior is worse, but the author's reaction is still wrong.\n"
