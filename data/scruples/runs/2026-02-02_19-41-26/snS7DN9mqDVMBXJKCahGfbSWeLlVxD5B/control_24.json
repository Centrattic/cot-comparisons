I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they were at a bar with an all-you-can-eat wings special. They waited a long time for their food, had two beers but weren't drunk. When the server gave out the food, he kept pulling back when handing it to the author, leading to a brief game of keep-away. The author then snapped and swore at the server, saying \"Give me my god damn food.\" The server then gave them the food, but everyone looked surprised.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The server's actions: pulling back the food when offering it. That sounds like maybe a prank or a playful tease, but it's not professional. Servers are supposed to be courteous and not engage in such behavior with customers. The author waited a long time and was clearly hungry. The server's actions could be seen as unprofessional and possibly contributing to the situation.\n\nThe author did use a swear word, but the context is that they were hungry and frustrated after a long wait. The server's behavior might have been the catalyst. However, using a swear word in that situation could be seen as inappropriate. The author mentions they have experience in service jobs and wouldn't do that to a customer, which adds a layer of understanding of the server's role.\n\nNow, considering the server's age (28) versus the author (21), but that might not matter much. The key points are: the server's unprofessional behavior, the author's response, and whether the server's actions justified the outburst. In professional settings, even if provoked, swearing is generally not acceptable. However, the server's actions were also unprofessional. The author's response was a reaction to the server's behavior. \n\nBut from a customer service perspective, the server should maintain professionalism regardless. The author's use of a swear word was a choice, even if provoked. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they could have handled it without swearing. Alternatively, the server's behavior was also at fault, so the author's reaction is somewhat understandable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, customers are expected to handle situations politely, even if they feel wronged. The author's response, while understandable in frustration, was a direct verbal outburst. So I think the author might be in the wrong because they used a swear word in a public setting, even if the server's actions were unprofessional. The server's behavior is not an excuse for the author's choice of words. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
