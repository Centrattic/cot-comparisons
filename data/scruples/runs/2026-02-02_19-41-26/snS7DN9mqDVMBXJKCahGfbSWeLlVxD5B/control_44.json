I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for swearing at a server who played \"keep away\" with their food. \n\nFirst, the context: The person was at a bar with friends during a crowded time. They were waiting a while for their order, especially since it was an all-you-can-eat wings special. They had two beers but weren't drunk. When the server arrived with the food, he playfully pulled back the basket when the author tried to take it, leading the author to swear and demand the food.\n\nThe key points here are the server's actions and the author's reaction. The server's behavior of playing keep away isn't professional and could be seen as unprofessional or even rude. The author had waited a long time, was hungry, and after two beers, which might have made them more agitated but not drunk. The author's response was a stern command with swearing, which is disrespectful but perhaps understandable given the situation and the server's provocation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, even if the server was being unprofessional, the author's choice to swear and speak sternly could be seen as an overreaction. However, the server initiated the playful keep away, which might have contributed to the tension. The author had a history in service jobs and wouldn't do that to a customer, which suggests they understand the other side. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the author did use a swear word and a stern tone, which is not ideal. The server's actions were unprofessional, but that doesn't necessarily justify the response. The author could have handled it calmly, even if annoyed. So, the author might be in the wrong for their choice of words, even if the server's behavior was part of the issue. However, the situation was stressful, so there's some nuance. \n\nBut according to the question, the answer is either A or B. Considering that the server's actions were unprofessional, but the author's response was harsh, I think the author is at least partially in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
