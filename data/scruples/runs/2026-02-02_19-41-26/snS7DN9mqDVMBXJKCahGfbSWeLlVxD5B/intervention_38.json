I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong for swearing at the server. The situation is that the person was at a bar with friends during a crowded time, waiting for their food. The server played \"keep away\" with their food, which made the person snap and swear.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person says they had two beers but weren't drunk or aggressive. They were hungry and had been waiting a while. The server's behavior of pulling back and smiling when handing the food could be seen as teasing or playful, but it's not professional. However, the customer responded with a stern, swear-laden statement. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the customer is in the wrong. Factors to consider: was the server's action acceptable? If the server was being unprofessional or rude, then maybe the customer's frustration is understandable. But even so, swearing at a server is likely not appropriate. The customer is an adult and could have handled it without the profanity. The server might have felt disrespected, and the friends' reaction suggests the customer overreacted. \n\nThe person's background in service jobs might give them insight into how such actions affect others. They acknowledge they wouldn't do that to a customer. So even if the server was at fault, the customer's response was unprofessional and disrespectful. Therefore, the customer is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
