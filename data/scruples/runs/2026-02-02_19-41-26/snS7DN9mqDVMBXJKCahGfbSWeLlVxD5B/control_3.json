I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author was at a bar with friends, waiting for their food. The server played \"keep away\" with the food, so the author swore at him, saying \"Give me my god damn food.\" The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they were hungry, had waited a long time, and weren't drunk. They also note that they have experience in service jobs and wouldn't treat customers that way. The server was 28, and the author is 21. The server's behavior of pulling back the food might be playful or a prank.\n\nNow, the key points here are about appropriateness of the customer's response. Even though the server might have been playing around, swearing at an employee, even if they're being silly, could be seen as unprofessional or rude. However, the author was clearly frustrated after waiting and might have felt that their patience was tested. The server's actions might have been part of their job, even if it was unprofessional.\n\nBut in customer service interactions, customers are generally expected to handle situations politely, even if the server is being unprofessional. Swearing can escalate the situation and might not be the best approach. The author's experience in service jobs makes them aware of how customers should treat staff, so maybe they should have understood the server's role and handled it differently.\n\nOn the other hand, the server's behavior might have been inappropriate to begin with. If the server was intentionally delaying the food in a teasing manner, that's unprofessional. However, the customer still has a responsibility to address it calmly. The author's reaction, while understandable given the circumstances, might still be considered inconsiderate.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author was frustrated and not drunk, but swearing at the server, even if the server was being unprofessional, could be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they responded with a swear word, which could be considered disrespectful regardless of the situation.\n"
