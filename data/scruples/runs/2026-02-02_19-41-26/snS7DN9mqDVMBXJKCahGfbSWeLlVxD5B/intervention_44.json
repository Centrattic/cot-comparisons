I was at a bar and there was an all you can eat wings special, and I was with my group of friends and we went almost every Tuesday. This time it was particularly crowded, so we were totally understanding when they told us it might take a while after they took our food and drink order. \n\nWe patiently waited for a long time and i\u2019d had 2 beers by then so I was definitely not drunk or remotely aggressive, just hungry. Finally when our food came, the waiter handed everyone there basket thingys. However, when he got to me he pulled back and smiled, and then i tried to grab it again, and he pulled back again. It was only like a ten second thing but I was hungry and had already waited enough and didnt want to deal with this so i said, \u201cGive me my god damn food.\u201d as sternly as i could. (I\u2019m 21 and server was like 28, and im used to stuff like this happening, but not from waiters, ive had tons of service jobs and would never do this.).\n\nHe immediately stopped smiling and gave me the food, but he and all my friends looked at me weird. \n\nWould really appreciate honest opinions, thanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for swearing at a server who was playing \"keep away\" with their food. They were in a bar with friends, had been waiting a while, and the server was being playful by withholding the food.\n\nFirst, the server's actions: pulling back the food and smiling sounds like a game, maybe trying to be humorous or test the customer's patience. While that's unprofessional, it's also a bit of a light-hearted prank, not an aggressive act.\n\nThe customer was hungry, had waited long, and after two beers (but not drunk). They responded with a stern \"Give me my god damn food.\" The key here is the use of a swear word and the tone. Even if the server was acting out, the customer's response was direct and confrontational. Swearing in public, even when frustrated, can be seen as disrespectful, especially towards someone doing their job, even if imperfectly.\n\nThe customer's background in service jobs might make them more aware of unprofessional behavior, but that doesn't excuse their reaction. The server was doing their job, albeit in a playful way. The customer's reaction could be seen as overstepping, even if they were stressed. The friends looking at them weird suggests it wasn't the expected response.\n\nSo, the server was in the wrong for playing games, but the customer's response was inappropriate. The customer used a swear word and a stern tone, which isn't acceptable behavior regardless of the situation. Even if the server was at fault, the customer's action was disrespectful and unprofessional. Therefore, the customer is at least partially in the wrong for their reaction.\n"
