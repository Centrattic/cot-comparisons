I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The key points from the situation are:\n\nFirst, the author is a 23-year-old single man who openly dislikes children and is part of a child-free community. He lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and he smokes it frequently. His house isn't baby-proofed because of his lifestyle and work setup. He works from home and has a side business with repair appointments. He was asked two days before a week-long cruise by his brother and sister-in-law to take the kids, but he declined because he couldn't rearrange his work, wasn't paid, and had prior plans (a guys' trip in two months). The brother and sister-in-law then accused him of being a drug-addicted, useless asshole, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister also thinks he should have helped, but the author argues that the request was unrealistic given his circumstances.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, family dynamics can be tricky. On one hand, the brother's trip is important to them, and they might have expected help from a sibling. But the author has valid reasons: he dislikes kids, his living situation isn't safe for them, he's not compensated, and he can't take time off work. The fact that they asked two days before the trip adds pressure, which might make it seem like they expected a quick solution. However, the author's refusal is based on real constraints, not just convenience. The brother's response of yelling and public shaming could be seen as harsh, especially since the author explained the unreasonableness of the request. The sister's perspective is mentioned, but the author isn't obligated to do unpaid work that conflicts with his life and isn't feasible. The term \"useless, drug addicted asshole\" is pretty strong, which might indicate the brother's frustration, but the author's reasons for declining are legitimate. So, considering all this, the answer would be B, No.\n"
