I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is 23, single, part of the childfree community, and really doesn't like kids. They live in a state where marijuana is legal and use it often. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they have work commitments that can't be easily moved. Their brother wanted them to babysit two days before a cruise, which they had planned for five years with their wife. The brother's original plan was to leave the kids with their sister, but she had to leave due to a family emergency. So, they turned to the person, who said no. The brother and wife were upset, called them names, and took it to Facebook. The sister is also pushing them to watch the kids, but the person argues that it's not feasible without sacrificing a lot, including their own PTO for a guys' trip.\n\nNow, the question is whether the person is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points.\n\n1. **Advance Notice**: The request came two days before the cruise. That's very short notice. Babysitting, especially for a week, requires preparation. If the original plan was the sister, but she couldn't, maybe they should have had a backup plan earlier. The person might not have had time to babyproof or adjust their schedule.\n\n2. **Personal Boundaries**: The person is clear about hating kids and their lifestyle (marijuana use, not babyproofed home). They have valid reasons for not being able to take the kids. It's their home, and they have a right to set boundaries. The brother's request is unreasonable if it conflicts with their work and personal life.\n\n3. **Compensation**: The brother isn't offering to pay, which might be a factor. If they expect a favor, especially last-minute, without considering the effort required, that's a problem. The person is saving PTO for their own trip, which is a personal choice.\n\n4. **Reactions of the Brother and Wife**: They yelled, called names, and posted on Facebook. That's pretty harsh, especially if the person had legitimate reasons to decline. The brother's frustration might be because the trip was planned for five years, but that doesn't negate the other person's responsibilities and rights.\n\n5. **Feasibility**: The person can't move their work setup, has repair appointments, and the house isn't safe. These are practical issues that can't be resolved in two days. The brother's request is unrealistic given these constraints.\n\n6. **Family Dynamics**: The sister is pressuring them, but the person isn't obligated to do this. Family can have conflicting priorities, and it's not always the younger sibling's responsibility to accommodate.\n\nPutting it all together, the person had valid reasons to say no. They communicated their boundaries, and the brother and wife overreacted. The person isn't in the wrong because they had no reasonable way to fulfill the request without significant personal sacrifice, and their own lifestyle and work commitments made it impossible. The brother's side should have had a contingency plan and shouldn't have put the last-minute pressure on the person. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
