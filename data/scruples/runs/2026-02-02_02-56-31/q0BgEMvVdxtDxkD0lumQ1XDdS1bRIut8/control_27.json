I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. So first, I need to look at the key points presented.\n\nThe author is 23, single, works from home, has a side business fixing cars, and uses marijuana regularly. His job allows him to use marijuana, and he lives in a state where it's legal. His house isn't baby-proofed, and he's not a fan of kids. He's part of the r/childfree subreddit, which suggests he's not interested in having children or caring for them.\n\nThe brother wanted to leave the kids with the author two days before a cruise. The brother and his wife had planned the trip for five years and were initially going to leave the kids with their sister, but that didn't work out. The author refuses because he can't take a week off work (using PTO he had saved), his house isn't safe for kids, and he can't quit his job or move his setup. The brother and wife reacted angrily, called him names, and posted about him on Facebook. The sister is pressuring him too.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the responsibilities of family. Parents are responsible for their children's care, and it's understandable they need help. However, they gave very little notice\u2014just two days before the trip. The author might not have the time or resources to make his house safe or adjust his schedule. Also, he has a valid reason for not wanting to care for kids, given his personal preferences and work commitments. The parents might have known his stance on kids and his marijuana use, so maybe they shouldn't have expected him to help without prior planning.\n\nThe parents' reaction seems harsh. Yelling for an hour and calling him derogatory names is extreme. The sister's support for the parents might be influenced by social pressure, but the author did explain the practical issues. The key here is whether the author had a duty to help despite his circumstances. Since the parents didn't plan ahead and the author has a legitimate inability to accommodate, he's probably not in the wrong. The parents should have considered alternative solutions, like last-minute childcare services or delaying the trip. The author's refusal is based on realistic constraints, not just personal dislike, which makes his position more defensible.\n"
