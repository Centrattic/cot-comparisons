I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author refusing to babysit their brother's kids last minute. \n\nFirst, the author is 23, hates children, and lives in a house that's not babyproofed. They also use marijuana regularly, which the brother and sister-in-law don't want around the kids. The brother asked two days before a cruise, which they'd planned for five years, and the author couldn't adjust their schedule or make their house safe. The brother's reaction was yelling and calling them names, and they posted about it on Facebook.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author made their feelings about children clear, the request was last-minute, they have a valid reason (work, house not safe, personal use of marijuana), and the brother's family is now criticizing them. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. From what I read, the author isn't being unreasonable. They provided their reasons, which seem legitimate. The brother didn't plan ahead, and the author's refusal isn't out of spite but practicality. Plus, the author's lifestyle (marijuana use) is a factor the in-laws want to avoid. \n\nThe sister thinks the author should help, but the author has other commitments and can't just drop everything. The author isn't obligated to babysit, especially if they've made their dislike of kids known. The brother's reaction seems harsh, and the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
