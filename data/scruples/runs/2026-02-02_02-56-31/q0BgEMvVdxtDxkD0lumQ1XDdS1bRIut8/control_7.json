I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. \n\nFirst, the context: the author is 23, a member of a child-free subreddit, hates kids, lives in a state where marijuana is legal, and uses it often. Their house isn't babyproofed. They work from home and have a side job with car repairs. The brother wanted them to watch the kids for a week for an anniversary cruise. The author said no because they can't take time off work (using PTO for a guys' trip), the house isn't safe, and they don't want to give up their marijuana. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nSo, the author's main points: They hate kids, their house isn't safe, they have work commitments, and they can't stop using marijuana. The brother asked last-minute, which the author found unreasonable. The author also mentions that the sister is in a situation where she can't take the kids either now.\n\nThe brother's side: They had the trip planned for five years, and they need someone to watch the kids. They might feel family should help in such cases. The author's refusal, especially with the added stress of a last-minute request, led to conflict.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong: From their perspective, they have valid reasons. They can't provide a safe environment, have work obligations, and their personal preferences (hating kids, using marijuana) make the situation even more challenging. The brother's request was two days before the trip, which is short notice. The author isn't obligated to take this on, especially since they weren't part of the original plan. The brother and sister-in-law might have known the author's stance on kids and their house situation. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish without reason; they have practical constraints. The brother's reaction (yelling, calling them names, Facebook rants) seems harsh. The sister thinking the author should help might not consider the real limitations. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they have legitimate reasons and weren't part of the original childcare plan. The brother's expectations were unreasonable given the short notice and the author's circumstances.\n"
