I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the user is 23, part of the childfree community, and really doesn't like kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have work commitments they can't cancel. The brother asked two days before a cruise they'd planned for five years. The user refuses because they can't take time off work, their house isn't safe, and they don't like kids. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and the sister is now pressuring them. The user is being called an asshole but thinks their reasons are valid.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user's personal dislike of kids, their inability to provide a safe environment, work conflicts, and the last-minute request. The brother's side is upset because they needed help at the last minute, and the user is seen as not being family-oriented. \n\nBut legally and ethically, adults aren't obligated to babysit unless there's a prior agreement. The user communicated their reasons clearly\u2014work, personal preferences, safety. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially public shaming. The user isn't being selfish without reason; they have legitimate constraints. The fact that the request was two days in advance complicates things, as it's not reasonable to expect someone to rearrange their life that quickly. Also, the user's job and side business are important for their income, and using PTO for a guys' trip is a personal choice they made before.\n\nThe brother and sister-in-law's demands\u2014throwing out marijuana and making the house safe in two days\u2014are unrealistic. The user isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. So, answer B (No) makes sense. They aren't obligated to help, especially with the circumstances given.\n"
