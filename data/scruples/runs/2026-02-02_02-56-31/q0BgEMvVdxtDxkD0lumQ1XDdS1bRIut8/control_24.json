I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of r/childfree, and hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they work from home with a side business fixing cars. They have a guys' trip planned in two months that they were using PTO for.\n\nThe brother wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary, planned for five years. Originally, they were going to leave the kids with their sister, but her family had an emergency, so she couldn't. Two days before the trip, they asked the author to babysit. The author said no because they can't take time off work, aren't paid, and their house isn't safe. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister now thinks the author should have done it.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The author has a legitimate reason for refusing: they hate kids, their house isn't safe, they have work commitments, and they weren't offered compensation. The brother asked last minute, which complicates things. The author's job requires them to be at home and have scheduled appointments. Also, the brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them names and using Facebook to rant. The sister's expectation might not consider the author's circumstances.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't obligated to babysit, especially since they have valid reasons. The brother should have planned ahead and considered alternative childcare. The author's refusal isn't selfish if it's based on real constraints. The brother's anger and public shaming seem more like they're in the wrong. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
