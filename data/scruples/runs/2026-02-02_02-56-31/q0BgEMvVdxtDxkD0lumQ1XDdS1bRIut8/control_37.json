I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about babysitting their nephew and niece. The user is 23, part of the childfree community, and really doesn't like kids. Their brother asked them last-minute to take care of the kids for a week because their sister couldn't. The user says no, and there's some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user has made their dislike of children very clear, so the family should know this. Also, their house isn't kid-safe, and they have work commitments. They were planning to use their PTO for a vacation. The brother and sister-in-law are upset, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook.\n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, the brother asked two days before the trip. That's short notice. The user's reasons for refusing seem valid: they don't like kids, their house isn't safe, and they have work obligations. Also, they weren't being paid, which could be a factor. The family might expect help, but the user's responsibilities and personal boundaries are important too. The brother's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling for an hour, using harsh language, and public ranting. The sister's judgment is also mentioned, but maybe she's influenced by the others.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's an expectation in some families to help out, even last-minute. But the user has valid reasons. The key points are the user's prior stance against kids, the impracticality of the request (moving work setup, house safety), and the lack of compensation. The brother's trip was planned for five years, but the user's refusal is due to their own limitations. The brother's response seems over the top, and the user isn't obligated to take on such a big responsibility, especially at short notice. So probably, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
