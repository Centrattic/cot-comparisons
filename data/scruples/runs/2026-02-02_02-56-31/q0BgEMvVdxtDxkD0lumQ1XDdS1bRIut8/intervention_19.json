I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. They're 23, part of the childfree community, hate kids, and live in a state where marijuana is legal. Their job allows working from home, and they use marijuana often. Their house isn't babyproofed.\n\nThe situation is that their brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, but their sister couldn't take the kids because of a family emergency. Two days before the trip, they asked the user to babysit. The user refused because they can't take time off work (using PTO for a guys' trip later), their house isn't safe, and they don't want to give up their marijuana. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks they should help, but the user feels it's unreasonable.\n\nSo, am I in the wrong? Let's break it down. The user's reasons: they hate kids, their house isn't safe, they can't take time off without using PTO, and they can't remove their marijuana. The brother's side: last-minute request, important trip planned for five years, expecting family support.\n\nFirst, family obligations. But the user isn't a parent, and they've made their dislike of kids known. The brother asked two days before, which is short notice. The user has valid logistical issues: work commitments, house safety, and maybe the marijuana issue. However, the brother might expect family to help in a pinch. But the user is single, works from home, and has other responsibilities. The fact that they were saving PTO for their own trip might be seen as selfish, but they have the right to their time. The marijuana part is a red flag for the brother, so they can't compromise there. \n\nThe brother's reaction seems harsh, calling them names and public shaming. The user's refusal based on valid reasons (no time, unsafe house, personal habits) makes sense. The sister's expectation might be common, but the user isn't obligated. So, probably not the asshole. Answer B.\n"
