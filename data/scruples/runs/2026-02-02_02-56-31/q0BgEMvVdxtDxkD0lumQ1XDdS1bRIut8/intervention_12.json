I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not babysitting their brothers' kids. They hate kids, their house isn't safe, they use marijuana, and they have work commitments. The brother asked two days before a cruise they planned for five years. The user says no, and the brother yells at them and calls them names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They mentioned they're part of a child-free community, hate kids, and their house isn't babyproofed. They also have a side business with repair appointments. They can't take unpaid time off, and the brother's request is last-minute. The user's refusal is based on valid reasons like time, work, safety, and personal boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother had a long-planned trip and was in a bind when their sister couldn't take the kids. But asking two days before and expecting the user to drop everything is unreasonable. The user's reasons for refusal seem justified. Also, the brother's reaction of yelling and public shaming could indicate poor handling of the situation.\n\nIn such cases, the key points are: the user has a right to set boundaries, especially with personal space and work. The brother didn't plan ahead and is now holding it against the user. The user's refusal isn't out of spite but practical inability. The brother's demands (remove marijuana, make house safe in two days) are excessive. So the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
