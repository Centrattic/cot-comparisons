I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, child-free, and a member of a subreddit where people express dislike for children. They hate kids and their family knows this. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they use marijuana frequently. They work from home, have a side business with car repairs, and were saving PTO for a trip. The brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids, but the author couldn't because of work and the house not being safe. The brother and sister-in-law were upset, called the author names, and the sister thinks he should have agreed. The author also mentions the brother's request is unrealistic.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author have a valid reason to refuse? The author has a known dislike for kids, the house isn't safe, and there's a conflict with work. The brother asked last minute without offering payment. The author's time and job are important, and the request came with unreasonable demands like getting rid of their weed and making the house kid-safe quickly.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, family can expect help, but there's a limit. The author's reasons seem valid. They're not obligated to accommodate such a last-minute request, especially when it's against their personal preferences and practical situations. The brother's reaction is harsh, and the author didn't promise beforehand to be available for babysitting. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
