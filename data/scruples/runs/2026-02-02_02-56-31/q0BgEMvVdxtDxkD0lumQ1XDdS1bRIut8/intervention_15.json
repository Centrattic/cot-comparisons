I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 23, part of the childfree community, and hates children. His family knows this. He lives in a state where weed is legal, and he smokes often. His house isn't babyproofed. He works from home and has a side job with car repairs.\n\nThe brother asked him last-minute to babysit for a week-long cruise on their anniversary. The brother had planned this for five years, but they couldn't use their sister because her family had an emergency. The user says no because: 1) he can't take time off work (using PTO for his own trip in two months), 2) his house isn't safe for kids, 3) he can't move his work setup, 4) he uses marijuana, which the brother doesn't want around kids. The brother and wife got angry, called him names, and posted about him on Facebook. The user is being told by others that he should help, but he's arguing it's not feasible.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. The user made his stance on children clear. The brother asked last-minute, which is unreasonable. The user has valid logistical issues (work, house safety, PTO). Also, the brother's request would require the user to make significant sacrifices (throw out weed, babyproof in two days), which isn't realistic. The brother's reaction seems harsh. The user's refusal is based on personal boundaries, work obligations, and safety. So, likely the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
