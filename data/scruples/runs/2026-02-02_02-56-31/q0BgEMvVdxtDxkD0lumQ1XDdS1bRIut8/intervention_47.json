I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. They've given a detailed situation.\n\nFirst, the user is part of r/childfree and hates children, which their family knows. They're 23, single, work from home, and have a side business working on cars. They use marijuana, which is legal where they live. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they have a lot of work commitments.\n\nThe brother planned a cruise for their anniversary, originally leaving the kids with their sister. But the sister had to leave due to a family emergency. Two days before the trip, the brother asks the user to babysit. The user says no because they can't take time off work (using PTO for a planned trip), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't give up their repair appointments. The brother and wife get angry, call the user names, and rant on Facebook. The sister thinks the user should help, but the user argues the request is unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points here are: prior knowledge of the user's dislike for kids and their lifestyle (marijuana use), last-minute request, the user's valid reasons (work, house safety, time constraints), and the family's reaction. \n\nThe user is being asked to make a significant sacrifice without compensation. The brother had planned the trip for five years, but the request came too late. The user's reasons for refusing seem legitimate. Family obligations can be tricky, but forcing someone to change their work and personal plans, especially with no prior notice, might not be fair. Plus, the user's house isn't safe, and they have other commitments. The brother's reaction seems harsh given the circumstances. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. Answer is B.\n"
