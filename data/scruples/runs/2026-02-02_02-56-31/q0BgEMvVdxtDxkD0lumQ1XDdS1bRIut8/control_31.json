I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author is part of the childfree community and openly says they hate kids. Their family knows this. They're 23, single, work from home, and have a side business working on cars. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they smoke often. Their house isn't babyproofed. They can't take a week off work because they have scheduled repair appointments and a planned guys' trip coming up.\n\nThe brother decided two days before a cruise to ask the author to babysit. The original plan was to leave the kids with the sister, but the sister had to leave for a family emergency. The author refused because: they can't take time off work, they don't get paid, their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't move their work setup. The brother and his wife got angry, called the author a \"useless, drug addicted asshole,\" and posted about it on Facebook. The sister now expects the author to take the kids, but the author can't.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the factors. \n\nThe author has made it clear they hate kids and that their house isn't safe. The brother's request came last minute, which is a problem. The author has work commitments and can't just drop everything. Also, the brother's wife wanted no marijuana in the house, which the author can't comply with since they smoke. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author isn't obligated to help. The brother's side didn't plan ahead. The author has valid reasons: work, personal preferences, and practical issues. The brother's reaction seems harsh, especially calling the author derogatory names and using the last-minute request. \n\nThe author isn't being selfish without cause; they have legitimate constraints. The brother could have planned better and maybe found alternative childcare. The sister was unavailable, but maybe there's another option. The author isn't being unreasonable in their refusal. The brother's anger seems misplaced, given the short notice and the author's stated preferences and commitments.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
