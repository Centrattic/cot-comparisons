I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not babysitting their brothers' kids. Let me break down the situation. They're a 23-year-old male, the youngest of three siblings, and they're part of the r/childfree community because they strongly dislike children. Their family is aware of this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal both medically and recreationally, and they use it. Their job allows them to work from home, and they have a side business working on cars.\n\nThe brother had planned a cruise for their anniversary, originally intending to leave the kids with their sister. But due to an emergency with the sister's husband's family, the sister had to leave. Now, two days before the trip, the brother is asking them to babysit. They have repair appointments scheduled for the week, can't take time off work without using PTO they saved for their own trip, and their house isn't baby-proofed or suitable for kids. Also, the brother and sister-in-law want them to throw out their marijuana and make the house safe quickly, which the user deems unreasonable. The family members reacted angrily, called them names, and posted on Facebook. The sister is pressuring them but the user can't comply without making a significant sacrifice.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user's refusal is justified. The user has a valid point about the short notice and the impracticality of making their house safe. They have a right to their own living space and lifestyle choices. The brother had made plans which were supposed to be covered by the sister, but when that falls through, they're turning to the user. The user has responsibilities and a schedule that can't be easily altered. The fact that the user isn't responsible for the original plan falling apart (the sister's emergency) is important. The user isn't in a position to provide the necessary care, and their dislike for children is a personal choice, though it might cause tension.\n\nThe brother's reaction\u2014yelling, calling them names, posting on Facebook\u2014seems extreme. The user is not obligated to provide childcare, especially on such short notice and with such demands. The sister's pressure might be adding to the conflict, but the user isn't at fault for not being able to meet their brother's expectations. They\u2019re being honest about their limitations. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
