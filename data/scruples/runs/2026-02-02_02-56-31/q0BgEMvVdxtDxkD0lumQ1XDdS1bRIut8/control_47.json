I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, child-free, and hates kids. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't baby-proofed. They work from home and have a side business fixing cars. They were planning to use their PTO for a guys' trip in two months. The brother asked two days before a cruise, which they'd planned for five years. The author refuses because they can't rearrange their work, can't make the house safe, and the brother's family wants no drugs around the kids.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author has a legitimate reason to refuse\u2014work commitments, personal preferences, and the impracticality of the request. The brother didn't plan ahead and is now asking for a last-minute favor that's a big ask. The author isn't being selfish without reason; they're stating their constraints. The brother's reaction of yelling and calling them names seems harsh. Also, the author isn't being offered any compensation, which adds to the imbalance.\n\nOn the other hand, family obligations can be tricky. But the author has made their stance clear about disliking kids and their lifestyle. The brother's expectation that family should drop everything for them might be unreasonable. The author's refusal isn't out of spite but practicality. The fact that the sister is also unavailable adds to the situation, but the author isn't obligated to step in without adequate notice or support.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's \"no\" is justified. The wrong here isn't on the author but rather on the brother for not planning ahead and expecting unreasonable accommodations. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
