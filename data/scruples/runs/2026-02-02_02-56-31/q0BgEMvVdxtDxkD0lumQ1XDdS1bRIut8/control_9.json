I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong by refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The situation involves several key points.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of r/childfree, and openly hates children. The family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and the author's house isn't babyproofed. They work from home and have a side business with car repairs. They can't take time off work for the cruise because they were saving PTO for a guys' trip. The brother asked two days before the trip, and the author said no. The brother and wife got angry, called the author names, and posted on Facebook.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the responsibilities of family. Typically, family support is expected, especially in emergencies or when planning is done in advance. However, the brother asked last minute, only two days before the trip. The author has valid reasons: their house isn't safe for kids, they can't take time off work without using PTO (which they were saving), and they personally dislike children. \n\nThe brother's anger and public shaming might indicate that their expectations were unreasonable. The author isn't obligated to provide childcare, especially when it's last-minute and involves personal sacrifices. The fact that the author had already mentioned hating kids and the house not being safe should have been known to the brother. The brother's reaction of yelling and using derogatory terms might suggest they overreacted.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should help when possible, but the author's reasons seem legitimate and they were upfront about their preferences. The brother's lack of planning (asking two days before) complicates things. The author isn't in a position to accommodate without significant personal loss, which they communicated.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong. Their refusal is based on valid, communicated reasons, and the brother's demands were unrealistic and unfair.\n"
