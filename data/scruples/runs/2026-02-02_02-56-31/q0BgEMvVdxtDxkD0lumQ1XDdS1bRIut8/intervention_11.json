I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. They're 23, part of r/childfree, hate children, their family knows that. They live in a place where marijuana is legal, and they smoke often. Their house isn't babyproofed. They have a job that's okay with marijuana use, but they don't go out much. \n\nTheir brother wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary, planned for five years. Originally, they were going to leave the kids with their sister, but the sister had to leave due to a medical emergency. So, two days before the trip, the brother asked the user to babysit. The user said no because they can't take a week off work (using PTO days they were saving for a guy's trip), their house isn't safe for kids, and they can't move their work setup. Plus, they can't comply with the request to get rid of their marijuana and make the house safe in such a short time.\n\nThe brother and his wife yelled at them for an hour, called them a drug-addicted asshole, and hung up. They're also ranting on Facebook, and the sister thinks the user should help. The user is feeling guilty but thinks their reasons are valid.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The user has legitimate reasons: they dislike kids, their house isn't safe, they have work obligations, and the request came late. They were saving PTO for their own plans. The brother's side is upset, but the user isn't obligated to help, especially given the short notice and the personal sacrifices involved. \n\nThe user's job allows them to work from home, but their side business (car work) is scheduled. Cancellation might be hard. Also, the brother's request to remove marijuana and babyproof in two days is unrealistic. The user's refusal isn't out of spite but practicality. The family might have expected help, but the user's boundaries are valid. \n\nIn some cultures, family obligations are strong, but the user has clearly communicated their stance. The brother's reaction is harsh, especially the public Facebook ranting and name-calling. The user isn't the asshole here because they're not being selfish without cause. They have a right to their personal space and time. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
