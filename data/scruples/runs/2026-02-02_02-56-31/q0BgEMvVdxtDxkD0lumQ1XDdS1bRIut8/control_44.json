I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person refusing to babysit their brother's kids. The brother and his wife wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary, but their original plan to leave the kids with their sister fell through because the sister had a family emergency. Two days before the trip, they asked the author, who's 23, to take care of the kids, but he said no.\n\nThe author has several reasons. First, he openly says he hates kids and is part of a child-free subreddit. His house isn't babyproofed, he works from home and uses marijuana (which is legal where he lives), and he can't take the week off work because he's saving PTO for a guys' trip. Also, he has scheduled repair appointments. The brother and wife were upset, called him a drug-addicted asshole, and posted about him on Facebook. The sister now thinks he should have helped.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, family obligations vs personal time. The author is being asked to make a significant sacrifice: a week of his time, using PTO he was saving, and adjusting his work and business schedule. He's not being paid, which adds to the burden. The cruise was planned for five years, but the request came two days before, which is very short notice. The author might not have the time or resources to prepare the house for kids, especially since it's not babyproofed and he uses marijuana. Also, he's not comfortable around kids, which is a valid personal preference. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother could have planned better. Maybe they should have had a backup plan for childcare instead of relying on the sister. The fact that they yelled at him and called him names might indicate they overreacted. The author's refusal is based on genuine reasons that affect his work and personal life. \n\nAlso, the author's use of marijuana is legal in his state, but the brother's concern about drug use around kids is understandable. However, the author's house isn't safe for kids regardless of the drugs. The brother's demands (throwing out marijuana and making the house safe in two days) are unreasonable, as the author can't just cancel work commitments or rebuild his home setup quickly. \n\nThe sister's opinion that he should help might be biased, but the key is whether the author is at fault. Since he provided valid reasons and the request was made with insufficient notice, it's more about the brother's poor planning and overreaction. The author isn't obligated to help beyond what's reasonable, especially when it affects his work and personal time. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
