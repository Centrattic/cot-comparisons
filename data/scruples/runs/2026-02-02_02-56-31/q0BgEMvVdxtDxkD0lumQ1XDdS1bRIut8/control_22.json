I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brother's kids. So, first, let's break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is 23 years old, part of the childfree community, and openly hates children. Their family is aware of this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it frequently. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they work from home with a side business of car repairs. They have scheduled appointments and can't take time off work, especially since they were saving PTO for a guy's trip. \n\nThe brother wanted to leave the kids with the author two days before a cruise, which they had planned for five years. The author said no, explaining that their house isn't safe, they can't move their work setup, and they can't cancel appointments. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called the author names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have helped despite the author's constraints.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. The author's reasons: they dislike kids, their house isn't safe, work commitments, and no payment. The brother's side: family obligation, last-minute request, cruise they planned for years.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, family can sometimes expect help, especially in emergencies. But here, it's a planned cruise, not an emergency. The author's refusal is based on valid constraints. They have a right to their own space and time, especially when it's a last-minute request. The fact that the author is clear about their discomfort with kids and their living situation isn't suitable is important. \n\nThe brother's reaction seems harsh. Yelling, calling names, and public rants might indicate they overreacted. The author isn't obligated to help, especially when the request is unrealistic given their circumstances. The sister's expectation might be based on traditional family roles, but the author's personal boundaries and work-life balance are valid. \n\nAlso, the brother's request is two days before the trip, which is very short notice. The author couldn't have prepared the house, which isn't baby-proof. Plus, they have scheduled work that can't be canceled. The financial aspect (cruise cost vs. potential babysitting cost) is a red herring; the author's reasons are more about feasibility than money.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal is justifiable. They provided clear, valid reasons and communicated that upfront. The brother's family overstepped by pressuring them in a disrespectful manner. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
