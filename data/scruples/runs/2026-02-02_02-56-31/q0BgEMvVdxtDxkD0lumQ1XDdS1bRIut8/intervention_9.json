I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 23, part of a family where a sibling is asking them to babysit two days before a cruise. The user hates kids, their house isn't kid-safe, they use marijuana (which the brother objects to), and they have work commitments. They refused and got yelled at, now they're wondering if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, the user's reasons: They don't like kids, their house isn't set up for them, they can't move their work setup, they have scheduled appointments, and they're saving PTO for a trip. The brother planned the cruise for five years but waited until last minute to ask. The user isn't getting paid, which adds to the burden. The brother wants them to throw out weed and make the house kid-safe quickly, which is a lot to ask in two days.\n\nThe family's perspective: They need help last-minute, maybe expecting family support. They might feel offended by the refusal, especially since it's a significant trip for them. However, the user's valid constraints (work, personal preferences, safety) are real. The brother's reaction (yelling, calling names, Facebook rants) seems over the top, indicating they might be in the wrong for not considering the user's situation and for their hostile response.\n\nThe sister's opinion is mentioned but not detailed. The key points are the user's clear reasons and the brother's unreasonable demands. The user isn't obligated to help, especially without notice or compensation. The brother's anger might be more about their own frustration than the user's wrongdoing. So, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
