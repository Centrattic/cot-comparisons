I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is 23, part of the childfree community, and really hates kids. His family knows this. He smokes marijuana, has a home setup that's not baby-safe, and works from home with a side job. His brother and sister-in-law planned a cruise for their anniversary and asked him last minute to babysit, but he refused. The brother was upset because they had the trip planned for five years and he's calling the user a drug addict and an asshole. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user's reasons: he's not a fan of kids, his place isn't safe, he's working from home, can't reschedule repair appointments, can't use PTO for this, and the request came too late. The brother criticized his drug use and home environment. The user is a single male, not in a position to take on childcare, especially unpaid.\n\nThe brother's side: they had the trip planned for five years, needed last-minute help because their usual caregiver (sister) couldn't make it due to a family emergency. They asked two days before the trip. They might feel like they're relying on family support, which is common in some families.\n\nBut the user has valid reasons. He's not a parent, so there's no obligation to babysit. He's upfront about his dislike for kids and the impracticality. The brother's demands (throw out weed, baby-proof in two days) are unreasonable. The fact that they're calling him names and ranting on Facebook seems like an overreaction. The user wasn't aware of the sister's situation beforehand, so the sudden request is unfair. Also, expecting unpaid help for a vacation is a stretch. The user's time and needs matter too. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
