I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for refusing to babysit their brothers' kids. The situation is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, part of the childfree community, and openly hates kids. Their family knows this. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they have work commitments. \n\nThe brother asked two days before a cruise to watch the kids. The brother had planned the trip for five years. The author refuses because they can't spare a week, aren't paid, would need to use PTO for their own trip, can't move their work setup, and can't make the house safe in time. The author's refusal leads to the brother and sister-in-law yelling, calling them names, and ranting on Facebook. The sister also thinks the author should have helped.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The key points are the author's right to refuse versus the brother's need for help. The author has valid reasons: job responsibilities, personal boundaries, and the impracticality of the request. They also mention the house isn't safe and they don't like kids. The brother's side is that it's a family obligation and a long-planned trip, but they gave very little notice. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. In most AITA scenarios, if someone has a legitimate reason to refuse and isn't being inconsiderate beyond their limits, they're not the asshole. The brother's reaction (yelling, Facebook rants) is also questionable. The author's refusal isn't out of malice but genuine inability. So the answer likely is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
