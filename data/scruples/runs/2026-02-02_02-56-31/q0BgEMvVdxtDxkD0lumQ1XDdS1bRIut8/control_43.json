I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 23-year-old man who doesn't like kids, smokes marijuana, and has a home that's not baby-proofed. His brother asked him at the last minute to babysit for a week so they could go on a cruise they'd planned for five years. He refused, and now the brother is upset and called him names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has clearly communicated his dislike for children and his lifestyle, which includes marijuana use. His house isn't safe for kids, and he has work commitments that can't be rescheduled. The brother asked two days before the trip, giving very little notice. The author is working from home and has repair appointments. He was saving PTO for a personal trip. The brother wants him to throw out his marijuana and make the house safe, which is a lot to ask in two days.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author isn't obligated to babysit. Family responsibilities can vary, but especially when there's no prior arrangement. The brother waiting until last minute and not considering the author's situation (like his house safety, work, and personal preferences) might be their fault. The author isn't being a bad person for saying no, especially when it's not feasible. The brother's reaction\u2014yelling, calling him names, and ranting on social media\u2014seems overly harsh. \n\nHowever, some might argue that as family, the author should have tried to help, even if it was inconvenient. But given the circumstances\u2014last-minute notice, the author's explicit reasons, and the brother's own planning (cruise for five years) without having a backup plan\u2014it seems the brother didn't consider the author's situation. The author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest about his inability to help and isn't making unreasonable demands. The brother's expectations were unrealistic given the timing and the author's personal circumstances.\n"
