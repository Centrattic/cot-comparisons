I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 23-year-old who hates children and doesn't have a baby-proofed house. He smokes marijuana and works from home. His brother and sister-in-law ask him to babysit their kids for a week just two days before their cruise, but he refuses because he can't take time off work, the house isn't safe, he doesn't want to be around kids, and they expect him to throw out his weed and make the house kid-safe quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of family. The brother and sister-in-law had planned this trip for five years and found themselves in a bind because their usual caregiver (the sister) was unavailable. They turned to the author last minute. But the author has valid reasons for not being able to help. He's working, has a business, doesn't have a safe environment, and has a strong dislike for children. \n\nIs it fair to expect someone who clearly states they hate kids and aren't set up for childcare to step in? Probably not. Also, the fact that they didn't plan ahead and waited until two days before the trip might be on them. The author isn't their primary caregiver, and the sister was supposed to take the kids but had to leave due to a family emergency. \n\nThe brother's reaction seems harsh, calling the author a \"drug addict\" and yelling for an hour. They wanted him to make significant sacrifices like using PTO and changing his living environment quickly. The author's refusal seems reasonable given the circumstances. The fact that he's saving his PTO for another trip adds to the conflict but isn't a deal-breaker for his responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He communicated his inability to help, and the family's expectations were unreasonable in the short notice and the specific demands. The answer is B.\n"
