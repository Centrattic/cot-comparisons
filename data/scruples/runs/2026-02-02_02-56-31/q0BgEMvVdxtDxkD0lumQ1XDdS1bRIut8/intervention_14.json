I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The question is about refusing to babysit their brothers' kids. They provided some context, so I need to consider all the relevant points.\n\nFirst, the person is 23, the youngest of three, and part of the r/childfree community. They really don't like kids, and their family knows that. Their house isn't babyproofed, and they use marijuana regularly, which is legal where they live. They work from home and have a car side business, so they're busy. The brother asked two days before a cruise that was planned for five years to leave the kids with them. The brother and sister-in-law then decided to ask the person, who said no. The brother and wife got angry, called them names, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister is trying to pressure them into taking the kids, but the person argues that the request is too last-minute and they have a lot of work and their own plans.\n\nSo, the main factors here are: the person's dislike of children, the sudden request, the lack of a safe environment, and their need to use PTO for their own trip. Also, the brother's cruise is important to them, but the person can't just drop everything. The brother's reaction was harsh, which complicates things.\n\nOn one hand, family can expect help sometimes, but the situation is last-minute and unrealistic. The person has a valid reason not to have kids in their home because it's not safe and they can't adjust their setup quickly. Also, the use of PTO and the fact that they're not being paid might be a factor in their decision. Their hatred of children is a personal choice, but it's a strong reason for refusal.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the brother is in a tough spot. They had the cruise planned for a long time, and maybe they didn't have other options. The sister had to leave, so maybe the person was the only available option. But the problem is that the request was made too late, and the person has legitimate constraints. The brother's response was aggressive, which might indicate they were inconsiderate of the person's situation.\n\nI think the key here is the suddenness of the request and the fact that the person has valid reasons (safety, work, personal preference) for not being able to take the kids. The brother's yelling and name-calling, as well as their public ranting, are also points against them. The person isn't obligated to provide childcare, especially under such short notice and without compensation. So, I'd say the person is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
