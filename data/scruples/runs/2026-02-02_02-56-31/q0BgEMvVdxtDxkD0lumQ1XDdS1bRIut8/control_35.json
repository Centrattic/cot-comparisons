I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is 23, childfree, hates kids, and lives in a state where marijuana is legal. They have a job that allows working from home but requires time, and they run a car repair side business. Their brother wanted them to babysit for a week-long cruise, but they refused. The brother and sister-in-law were upset, called them names, and posted on Facebook.\n\nThe main points here are: The author made it clear they hate kids and their house isn't safe. The brother asked two days before the trip, which is last-minute. The author has work obligations, can't rearrange their schedule, and the brother isn't offering payment. Also, the author's house has marijuana, which the brother wants kept away from kids. \n\nIs refusing to babysit under these circumstances wrong? The author has a right to say no, especially since they weren't consulted earlier, their living situation isn't suitable, and they have their own commitments. The brother's anger seems excessive given the short notice and the author's valid reasons. The fact that the author is upfront about their dislike of kids and their house being unsafe is a key point. \n\nAlso, the sister's support for the brother's demand but not considering the author's constraints might indicate the brother is being unreasonable. The author isn't obligated to provide childcare, especially without notice or compensation. The brother's reaction of yelling and public shaming adds to the argument that the blame isn't on the author. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They have legitimate reasons and boundaries.\n"
