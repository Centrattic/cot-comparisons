I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author is 23, part of the childfree community, and really hates kids. They live in a state where marijuana is legal and use it often. Their house isn't baby-proofed, and they work from home with a side business fixing cars. They were asked by their brother at the last minute to babysit for a week while the brother goes on a cruise with his wife. The brother had originally planned to leave the kids with their sister, but she's unavailable due to a family emergency. The author says no because they can't rearrange their work, don't want to give up their PTO days, and their house isn't safe for kids. The brother and sister-in-law got angry, called them a drug addict and a useless asshole, and posted about it on Facebook. The sister thinks the author should have agreed.\n\nThe question is: Is the author in the wrong for refusing? Answer A or B.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author has a valid reason for not wanting to babysit: they hate kids, their house isn't safe, they have work commitments, and they were asked at the last minute. The brother had the trip planned for five years but didn't plan ahead for childcare, relying first on their sister and then the author. The author was saving their PTO for their own trip. The brother's request seems unreasonable because it's short notice, and expecting the author to make their house safe and give up a week of work without compensation isn't fair. Plus, the brother and sister-in-law were harsh in their response, even using derogatory terms and public shaming.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations could require stepping up, especially when someone else's plans are at stake. However, the author has made their stance clear about disliking kids and not having a suitable environment. They also have their own commitments. The brother's anger and the way they treated the author might indicate that they didn't consider the author's situation or boundaries.\n\nIn many cases, people are expected to respect others' boundaries, especially when it comes to personal time and living conditions. The author isn't being selfish just for saying no when the request is unrealistic. The brother's reaction seems more about not having a backup plan than the author's refusal. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
