I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're an asshole for not babysitting their brother's kids. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, from the context, they're part of r/childfree and they hate children. Their family knows this. They're 23, single, have a job that allows marijuana use, and run a car repair side business. They don't go out much. The brother wanted to take a week-long cruise for their anniversary but had to ask them two days before the trip. The sister was supposed to take the kids, but her husband's family emergency took her away. The brother and his wife want the user to take the kids but the user can't because their house isn't safe, they can't move their work setup, and they have scheduled appointments. Plus, they were saving PTO for their own trip. The parents yelled, called them a drug addict and useless, and posted on Facebook. The user is now feeling blamed and wants to know if they're wrong.\n\nSo the main points: the user's refusal is based on several factors. Their house isn't baby-proofed, they have a side business with appointments that can't be canceled, they were saving PTO for their own plans, and their routine involves marijuana, which the parents would want to avoid. The brother's family is arguing that it's a last-minute request but they had planned the cruise for five years. The sister is siding with them, but the user feels it's not feasible.\n\nNow, considering if the user is in the wrong. The key factors here are the short notice, the user's personal circumstances (work, house safety, drug use), and the family's expectations. Typically, babysitting for family can be expected in emergencies, but here it's a planned vacation that was supposed to be covered by the sister. The user wasn't given time to prepare, and their refusal is based on valid reasons. The parents' reaction seems harsh, especially with yelling and public shaming. The user isn't the one at fault here because they communicated their inability to take on the responsibility, and the request was unreasonable given the timing and their existing commitments. The fact that the parents had planned this for five years but didn't have a backup plan if the sister couldn't make it also points to their responsibility. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
