I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user, who's 23 years old and part of the childfree community, strongly dislikes children. They live in a state where marijuana is legal, and they use it often. Their house isn't baby-proofed. They have a job that allows them to work from home but they need to manage their PTO days for a planned trip. \n\nTheir brother and sister-in-law wanted to go on a cruise for their anniversary, but their usual babysitter (the sister) is unavailable due to a family emergency. So two days before the trip, they ask the user to babysit. The user declines because they can't take time off work, their house isn't safe for kids, and they use marijuana. The parents get angry, yell at them for an hour, call them names, and post about it on Facebook. The user's sister thinks they should have agreed, but the user argues that the request is unrealistic and unfair.\n\nSo the question is whether the user is the asshole for refusing. \n\nFirst, the user's reasons: they hate kids, their house isn't safe, they can't take the time off (since they have to use PTO for their own trip), and they use marijuana, which the parents don't want around kids. The parents are asking for a last-minute favor, two days before the trip. The user has existing commitments (car repair appointments) and work. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the parents are asking for a big favor with little notice. The user has legitimate reasons to say no. It's their right to not want to take care of kids if they have a strong dislike for them. Also, their lifestyle (using marijuana) is legal in their state, but the parents would prefer the kids not be exposed to that. But the parents should have considered this earlier. \n\nThe parents might argue that family should help each other, but the user has valid constraints. The user isn't obligated to help unless there's a prior agreement. The parents didn't plan ahead, and the user is within their rights to decline. The parents' reaction (yelling, calling names, Facebook rants) seems excessive. \n\nHowever, maybe in some family contexts, there's an expectation of support. But given the short notice and the user's personal situation, it's reasonable to say no. The user isn't in a position to help, so it's not their fault. \n\nSo I think the answer is B: No, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
