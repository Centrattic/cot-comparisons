I personally HATE children, and my family knows this. I am 23 years old, the youngest of three, and live in a state where marijuana is legal(medically and recreationally). Now, currently im a single male, who can cook, loves to work on cars(which is my side business), watch movies, and works from home(my job is okay with the use of marijuana). So i dont go out too often.\n\nSo suffice to say i smoke quite often, my house is not baby proofed, and with the constant workload i have, i cant really take on kids, whether mine or someone elses.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMy brother planned to go on a week long cruise with his wife, on their anniversary. In which they were going to leave their kids with our sister, which they cant do as her husbands side of the family had a medical emergency, so they flew out to be with his family, \n\nIt is two days before their trip. They just now decided to ask me if i would watch them, and of course i said no. Now i cant spare an entire week of not working, just so they can go on a cruise. Especially since they arent paying me, and i would have to use my PTO days, Which i was saving for a guys trip in two months.\n\nNow they dont want any marijuana in the house while their kids are there, and they want their kids to be in a safe environment. Which is completely understandable, But i cannot move my entire work setup to their house, and my house is not a safe fit for kids. Nor can i cancel on the repair appointments i have scheduled through the week.\n\nSo him and his wife yelled at me for about an hour, on how i should make time to watch their crotch goblins,  since they are family, and have had this trip planned for five years. They also wanted me to throwout the 2 ounces of skywalker OG, and manage to make my house kid safe in two days.\n\nWhen i told them their request was beyond unrealistic and unreasonable, they called me a useless, drug addicted asshole, and hung up on me. In the four hours following, they have ranted about me on facebook,  sister thinks i should watch them,  but their is no feasible way without me making a much larger sacrifice than like $900 cruise tickets.\n\nTldr: am i(23m) an asshole for refusing to watch my brothers kids, so he and his wife can go on a cruise, that they had planned for five years, two days before they leave, when i have no time to care for two children, pared with my hatred of children, and the fact that my house is in **NO WAY safe for children**\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not babysitting their brother's kids. They provided a detailed scenario. First, I need to break down the key points here.\n\nThe user is 23, single, lives in a state where marijuana is legal. They've mentioned hating kids and being part of a childfree community, so that's a strong personal preference. They have a job and a side business with repair appointments scheduled. The brother asked two days before a cruise on their anniversary, which was planned for five years. The sister is unavailable due to a medical emergency. The user refuses because they can't take time off (using PTO), the house isn't babyproofed, and they use marijuana. The brother and sister reacted negatively, called them a drug addict, and posted on Facebook. The sister still thinks they should have said yes.\n\nSo, from the user's perspective, they're not in the wrong because they have valid reasons: personal dislike of children, work commitments, the house isn't safe, and the brother didn't plan ahead. But others might see it as being selfish or not family-oriented, especially since the cruise was a big deal for the anniversary.\n\nI need to consider if the refusal is justified. The user was given no time to prepare, and their home isn't suitable. They also mention not being paid, which might be a factor. Family obligations can sometimes be expected, but if the request is last-minute and the user clearly can't meet the demands, maybe not. The brother's reaction is harsh, but does that make the user the asshole?\n\nAlso, the user is prioritizing their own work trip over the brother's. But the brother's trip is once every five years, while the user's is in two months. Should the user accommodate even if it's a sacrifice? The user's reasons seem valid, but the way the brother handled it is poor. The sister's expectation might add pressure, but the user's explanation is realistic.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person had a good reason and if the request was reasonable. The brother didn't plan ahead, and the user's home isn't suitable. The user also has a right to their personal time and space. So, the user is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
