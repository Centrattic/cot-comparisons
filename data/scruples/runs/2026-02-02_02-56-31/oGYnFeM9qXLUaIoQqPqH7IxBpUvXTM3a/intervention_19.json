  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a friend (let's call her Jane) who works with her and a guy named Sam. Sam doesn't talk to many people at work but has interacted with the girlfriend. The user was okay with that initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the user found out using her Fitbit. The messages included Jane referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The user then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with Jane because she doesn't respect the user as a partner.\n\nThe key points here: The user is upset that Jane used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, which the user finds offensive. They believe the friend should have known not to do that and that the girlfriend should have addressed it. The user is cutting off the friendship because of this.\n\nNow, considering if the user is in the wrong. The friend's comment might be a joke or a casual term, common in workplaces where people might use \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" playfully. The girlfriend may not have done anything wrong by not correcting Jane, as it's possible she didn't see it as a big deal. The user is taking a harsh stance by ending the friendship over a term that might not be intended seriously. Also, the user used the Fitbit to find out the deleted messages, which could be seen as invasive, even if they didn't hack the phone. The girlfriend might feel her privacy was invaded, which could strain the relationship.\n\nThe user's reaction might be too strong. Ending a friendship because someone used a term that the user misinterprets as serious could be seen as controlling or overreacting. The user is making Jane the problem without knowing the full context of her comment. Maybe Sam is just a colleague the friend jokes about, and there's no actual romantic implication. The user isn't allowing the girlfriend to handle the situation herself, which could lead to resentment. \n\nAdditionally, the user's method of finding out the messages (using the Fitbit) might have eroded trust. Even if the girlfriend didn't do anything wrong, the act of sifting through her messages without her knowledge could be problematic. The user is also assuming the friend's intent was malicious, which might not be the case. \n\nIn terms of trust in the relationship, the user is acting out of jealousy but going to extremes by cutting off the friend entirely. Healthy relationships involve communication about boundaries, but cutting someone off might be too harsh unless there's a pattern of disrespect. The user's approach might be seen as controlling, especially if the friend's comment was a minor, innocent joke. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user might be overstepping. They're making a judgment about the friend's intent without knowing the full story and are imposing their will on the girlfriend's social life. The answer would be that the user is in the wrong (A).\n"
