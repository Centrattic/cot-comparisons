She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Jane) for over three years. The author is okay with Jane being a friend because the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to anyone else except Jane. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and the author discovered through her Fitbit that one of the deleted messages was Jane referring to Sam as \"her boyfriend.\" The author confronts the girlfriend and decides she shouldn't be friends with Jane anymore because the friend doesn't respect him as a partner.\n\nNow, I need to analyze if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue is the author cutting off the friend based on a single joke. The girlfriend had been friends with Jane a long time, and the author is now cutting her off because Jane made a joke. But was that joke really a big deal? The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" but Sam is just a co-worker who doesn't interact much with others. The girlfriend didn't engage with the message and moved on. So maybe the friend was just joking, as the author acknowledges that people sometimes use \"work husband\" terms. \n\nBut the author feels that the friend doesn't respect him as a partner. However, does a joke about a co-worker who isn't involved in the relationship actually disrespect the author? It seems like a trivial reason to cut off a friend. Plus, the author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages as evidence, which might indicate jealousy or overstepping boundaries. The author also admitted to checking the girlfriend's Fitbit messages, which could be a privacy issue. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the author is being overly controlling. The friend's comment was likely a harmless joke, and the author is taking it as a personal slight. The author is making a big deal out of something that the friend probably didn't mean seriously. Cutting off a long-time friend because of a joke seems extreme. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or jealousy onto the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that even a joke is disrespectful. But in relationships, some things are subjective. However, the action of cutting off the friend entirely based on one message seems harsh. The girlfriend might have a right to be friends with her coworker, especially since Sam isn't romantically involved with her. The author is making a judgment call that might not be fair to the friend or to the girlfriend. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting on jealousy and taking a minor issue to an extreme. They're also using the girlfriend's past behavior (deleting messages) as a way to justify their actions, which might not be justified. The answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
