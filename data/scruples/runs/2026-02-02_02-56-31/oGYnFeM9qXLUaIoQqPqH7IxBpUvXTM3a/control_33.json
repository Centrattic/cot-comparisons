  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the girlfriend being friends with a co-worker named Sam. The author, the boyfriend, found out that the friend called Sam the girl's \"boyfriend\" and now he's cutting off the friendship.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is being controlling here. He's not okay with the friend referring to someone else as the boyfriend. But wait, Sam is a co-worker who only interacts with the girlfriend, and the friend made a joke about him being her boyfriend. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The boyfriend found out through deleted messages and the Fitbit thing, which feels a bit invasive. But he used that info to confront her and then cut off the friend.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. The friend's message was probably a joke, maybe not meant to be serious. The girlfriend didn't engage with it, so maybe she's not in the wrong. But the boyfriend is taking it as a personal insult and cutting off the friend for making a joke. That seems a bit extreme. Friends shouldn't be cut off over a joke unless there's a pattern of disrespect. The boyfriend is acting out of jealousy, but the friend didn't do anything wrong. The boyfriend's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) is sneaky and could be a breach of trust. Cutting off the friend entirely because of one joke is a big reaction. So maybe the author is the asshole here. Answer A.\n"
