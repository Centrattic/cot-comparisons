She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author initially allowed the friendship because the girlfriend said the coworker (Sam) didn't talk to anyone else. Then, the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author took as a joke or disrespect. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out through her Fitbit. The author confronted her and now wants the friend to stop being friends with her.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author overreacted. The friend made a joke by calling someone else a \"boyfriend,\" but the author sees it as a lack of respect for their relationship. The girlfriend tried to move past it, but the author is cutting off the friend entirely. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. However, the author's response seems extreme. The friend's comment might be a harmless joke, common in workplaces, and the girlfriend might have addressed it. The author's decision to end the friendship without discussing boundaries first could be seen as controlling. Also, using the Fitbit to monitor messages raises privacy issues. While the author might feel betrayed by the messages being deleted, cutting off a friend over a joke is a harsh reaction. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend didn't directly address the author, but the author is taking it personally. The right approach would be to talk to the friend about the comment and set boundaries. Completely cutting off a long-time friend based on a single joke might not be justified. So, the author is likely in the wrong for overreacting and not communicating directly with the friend.\n"
