She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend who referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The boyfriend is okay with the friend at first because the friend is one of the few Sam talks to. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, which the boyfriend finds out through her Fitbit. One of the deleted messages was the friend calling Sam her \"boyfriend.\" The boyfriend tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with this person because he feels disrespected.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the boyfriend's reaction to the friend's comment. The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend didn't address. The boyfriend then demands the end of the friendship because he believes the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is wrong. The boyfriend's reasoning is that the friend's joke is inappropriate and shows disrespect. However, cutting off a friend over a single joke might be a strong reaction. The girlfriend didn't correct the friend, which could be a point of discussion between the couple. But the boyfriend's approach of ending the friendship without addressing the issue with the friend first could be seen as overreacting. He's not allowing the girlfriend to handle the situation herself, which she might have done if he had discussed it with her first.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's method of finding out about the deleted messages through the Fitbit raises privacy concerns. Using her Fitbit data without her knowledge could be an invasion of privacy. While the girlfriend did delete messages, the boyfriend's approach to uncovering this might not be ethical. However, the main question is about ending the friendship, not the method of finding out.\n\nIn terms of the friendship, the friend's comment is a joke that could be seen as inappropriate, but it's a single instance. The boyfriend's immediate reaction to cut off the friend might be too harsh, especially since the girlfriend didn't act on the comment. The boyfriend could have discussed his discomfort with the girlfriend and let her handle it, rather than taking unilateral action.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action might be seen as extreme and controlling. He's not allowing the girlfriend agency in handling the situation and is cutting off a long-term friend over a joke. Therefore, he could be in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of the friend's comment being disrespectful. However, the main issue is the author's response. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because his reaction is disproportionate and controlling.\n"
