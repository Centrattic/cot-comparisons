  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's long-time friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years, and the friend is the only one that the coworker, Sam, interacts with at work. The user found out through deleted messages on the Fitbit that the friend referred to Sam as the girlfriend's boyfriend. The user then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect them as a couple.\n\nFirst, I need to consider trust and communication in the relationship. The user and girlfriend have been on and off for four years and together for three months. The user is acting on information they discovered through the Fitbit, which the girlfriend didn't know about. The user's main issue is the friend's comment about Sam. But Sam isn't the boyfriend; the user is. The friend's joke might have been harmless, but the user is taking it seriously. \n\nIs cutting off a three-year friend over one joke too harsh? The girlfriend might feel that her friend was just making a light-hearted comment, not intending to disrespect the relationship. The user's reaction could be seen as controlling, especially since they used a Fitbit to monitor messages. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being undermined. Also, the user is making a decision without discussing it with her, instead of addressing the friend's comment directly. \n\nOn the other hand, the user feels that the friend disrespected them by referring to another man as the boyfriend. They might believe that such jokes are inappropriate in a relationship. However, the friend might not have known the user existed or that it was a sensitive topic. The user's approach of cutting off the friend entirely seems extreme without giving the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. \n\nThe key points are: the user's method of discovering the message (using Fitbit) might have breached trust, the friend's comment could be a joke, and the user's reaction is cutting off a long-time friend without consultation. The user's trust in the relationship is important, but the way they handled it might be the issue. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the user is in the wrong) because they're overreacting and using surveillance tactics, which can damage the relationship. Instead of cutting off the friend, addressing the friend's comment directly might have been a better approach. The user's actions could be seen as controlling and not giving the situation the benefit of the doubt.\n"
