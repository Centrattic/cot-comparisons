She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after she called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author is okay with her interacting with the coworker since they only wave and the coworker doesn't talk to others. Then, the author finds out that the friend jokingly referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" and he decides to end the friendship.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and boundaries. The author discovered the message through the girlfriend's Fitbit, which she didn't know. He used that to confront her and then decided to cut off the friend. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The friend's comment might be seen as a joke, but the author feels it's disrespectful. However, cutting off a long-term friendship over a single joke could be heavy-handed. The girlfriend might feel that the friend didn't mean harm, and the author's reaction is too severe. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (through the Fitbit) is a bit sneaky, even if he didn't directly hack her phone. Using the knowledge that her Fitbit lags could undermine trust. \n\nThe author is enforcing his boundaries, but the question is whether his reaction is justified. The friend's comment might be innocent, and the author's decision to end the friendship could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's friend didn't necessarily intend to disrespect the relationship; it might just be a work joke. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and set boundaries together. The author's approach might have been too abrupt without discussing it with his girlfriend first. He assumed the friend was being disrespectful, but maybe a conversation with the friend to express his discomfort would have been better than cutting ties. \n\nSo, the author's actions stem from his need to feel respected, but the method and reaction might be too harsh, making him the asshole here.\n"
