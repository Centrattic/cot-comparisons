  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user's main issue is that the friend referred to someone else as \"boyfriend,\" which they took offense to. The girlfriend initially told the user that this coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to anyone else at work and only interacts with her. The user trusted her until they found out about the messages, which led to the decision to end the friendship.\n\nThe user's actions include checking the girlfriend's Fitbit to find deleted messages. Even though they didn't hack the phone, using the Fitbit to get information without her knowledge is a privacy concern. The girlfriend is under the impression the user hacked her phone, which adds tension here. The user then confronts her, leading to the friend being cut off.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The friend's comment might have been a joke or innocent, but the user is taking it seriously. The girlfriend might not have communicated that the term was an issue, and the user is now punishing the friend without giving them a chance to explain. Also, the user is ending a three-year friendship because of one comment, which could be seen as overreacting.\n\nHowever, the user's feelings about boundaries in the relationship are valid. If they're uncomfortable with the term being used, it's reasonable to address it. But cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it with the girlfriend first, especially after using a Fitbit to snoop, complicates things. The user's method of handling the situation\u2014without giving the friend a chance to clarify\u2014might be seen as harsh.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user should have talked to the girlfriend about their discomfort with the term first. Instead, they took unilateral action based on deleted messages, which could be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended harm, and the user's response could damage the girlfriend's trust if she values that friendship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is acting out of jealousy and a desire to set boundaries, but their approach is problematic. They might be in the wrong because of the invasive methods and the immediate decision to cut off the friend without context. The answer is likely A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
