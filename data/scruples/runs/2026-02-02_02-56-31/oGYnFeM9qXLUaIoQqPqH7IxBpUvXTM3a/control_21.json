She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the user's girlfriend has a co-worker friend who called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The user then decides the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with that person anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend and this friend have been friends for three years. The user was initially okay with the friend since he only interacted with her. The user found out through deleted messages that the friend referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" which he didn't like. He confronted his girlfriend and told her to stop being friends with her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship. Let's think about the dynamics here. The main issue seems to be the user's reaction to the friend's comment. The friend called someone else her \"boyfriend,\" which the user perceives as a slight or disrespect. But is that a valid reason to end a friendship? \n\nThe user's argument is that the friend doesn't respect him as a partner and the relationship. However, the friend's use of the term might have been a joke or an innocent term, as the user acknowledges some people use \"work husband\" casually. The user is quick to take offense and end the friendship without discussing it with his girlfriend first. Instead, he uses the fact that she deleted messages (which he found out through her Fitbit) to confront her, leading to the ultimatum.\n\nBut is that fair? The girlfriend had been friends with this person for years, and the user's reaction seems extreme. Also, the user admitted to going through her phone and using her Fitbit data to find out what she deleted. That raises questions about trust and privacy. Even if the user felt betrayed, cutting off a friend over a single comment might be too harsh. The friend didn't address the user directly, and the comment was about someone else. The user's approach also seems controlling, as he's dictating who his girlfriend can be friends with based on a third party's comment. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" is inappropriate in the workplace and that the friend's use of it undermines his relationship. However, the line between jealousy and overstepping boundaries is thin here. The girlfriend might have a right to her own friendships and how she handles comments from friends. The user's method of finding out the information (through deleted messages and Fitbit) also suggests a lack of trust, which could contribute to the problem.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend first, rather than immediately cutting off the friend. The girlfriend might have already addressed the comment, or at least, they could have worked together on how to handle it. By cutting off the friend, the user might be overreacting and not considering the value of the friendship or the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the user's actions seem to stem from jealousy and a lack of trust, using a controlling approach to end a friendship based on a single comment. That likely makes him the asshole in this situation. The answer would be A.\n"
