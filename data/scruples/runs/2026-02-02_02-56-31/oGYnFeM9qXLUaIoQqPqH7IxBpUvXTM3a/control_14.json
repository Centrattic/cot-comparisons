She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is okay with the friendship initially, trusting her when she said the coworker doesn't talk to others. Then, the friend refers to another coworker as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds unacceptable. The girlfriend deletes messages, which the author discovers via the Fitbit. The friend's comment is the trigger for the author ending the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is cutting off a friend because the friend made a joke about calling someone else a boyfriend. The girlfriend didn't engage with the message and moved on. The author is enforcing boundaries about how others refer to relationships, which is understandable. However, cutting off a friend over a single joke might be too harsh. The friend might not have intended it seriously, and the girlfriend's reaction (ignoring it) suggests she didn't take it seriously either. \n\nBut the author's main issue is about respect for him and the relationship. If the friend's comment was a joke, maybe the author is overreacting. However, if the author has clear boundaries about such terms, the friend's action could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe author's method of finding out through Fitbit is a bit sneaky, but that's not the main question. The main issue is the decision to end the friendship. The author is enforcing his relationship boundaries, but the friend might not be aware that it's an issue. The girlfriend might have handled it better by addressing it with the friend. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the friend's comment was a joke and the author is being overly controlling, then yes. But if he's standing up for his boundaries, maybe not. However, cutting off someone over a single joke might be excessive. The balance between respecting relationships and controlling others' friendships is tricky here. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because cutting off a friend over a minor, possibly joking comment could be too harsh, and the author is being controlling without considering the context.\n"
