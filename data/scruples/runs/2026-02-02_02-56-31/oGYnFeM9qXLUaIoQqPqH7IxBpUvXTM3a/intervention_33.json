  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves a few elements: trust, communication, and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the user and their girlfriend have been together on and off for four years and are now living together. The girlfriend has a friend (let's call her Jane) who has been her coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as not talking to many people at work but interacting with the girlfriend. The user was okay with that because he trusted her. However, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the user found out through the Fitbit. The key message was Jane referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which the user took as a sign of disrespect towards him and their relationship.\n\nThe user then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with Jane because she called Sam her boyfriend. The user's main points are: they don't allow work \"husbands,\" they don't want such terms used, and they believe Jane disrespected them. The girlfriend ignored the message, and the user is now cutting off the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The user's actions stem from a place of insecurity or wanting to protect the relationship. However, cutting off a friend solely because the friend jokingly referred to another coworker as a boyfriend might be overreacting. The term \"boyfriend\" in a workplace could be a casual reference, not a serious one. The user didn't address the situation directly with Jane or the girlfriend first; instead, they decided to end the friendship based on one message. \n\nThe girlfriend had already told the user that Sam doesn't interact much with others, implying that Jane's comment might not be taken seriously. The user's method of finding out (through Fitbit) without the girlfriend's knowledge shows a lack of trust, which could contribute to the problem. The user also mentions that the girlfriend deleted messages, but the user's approach to confronting her was through deception, which might strain trust further.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, the user has the right to feel disrespected if they don't want such terms used. However, cutting off a friend entirely without discussing it with the girlfriend or Jane might be too harsh. The user should have communicated their feelings to the girlfriend first and perhaps to Jane to understand the context better. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the user overstepped by ending the friendship without proper communication. Relationships require open dialogue, and assuming the worst from one message without context might not be fair. The user's actions could be seen as controlling or not giving Jane a chance to explain. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for the abrupt decision without addressing the issue more constructively.\n"
