  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend\". The girlfriend and this friend have been friends for three years, and the friend is one of the few people the coworker (Sam) interacts with at work. The user found out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend\" in a message, which was deleted but the user saw via the Fitbit. The user then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect them.\n\nFirst, the user's main issue is the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" for Sam. The girlfriend wasn't aware the user had read the message, and she didn't find it problematic. The user is cutting off the friend without discussing it first. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is important. The user is acting on jealousy or insecurity, but the friend's comment might be seen as a joke or not intended to disrespect. The user is making a decision that affects the girlfriend's friendship without considering her perspective. The girlfriend might feel that the user is overreacting and making a judgment without understanding the context of the joke. Also, the user used a Fitbit to read messages, which could be seen as invasive, even if the girlfriend had deleted texts. \n\nThe user's approach of cutting off the friend entirely seems extreme. Communication is key here. Instead of ending the friendship, discussing boundaries with the friend might be a better solution. The user's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal boundaries with respect for each other's social connections. The user's reaction might be valid if they feel disrespected, but the method of cutting off the friend without discussion could be seen as the issue. So, the answer would likely be that the user is in the wrong (A) because they're making a unilateral decision without proper communication and possibly overreacting to a joke.\n"
