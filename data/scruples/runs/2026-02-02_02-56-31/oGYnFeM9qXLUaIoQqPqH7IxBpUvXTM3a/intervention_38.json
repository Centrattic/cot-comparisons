  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe user is a guy (let's call him the boyfriend) in a relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been living together for three months but have been on and off for four years. The girlfriend has a close female co-worker (let's name her Jane) who she's been friends with for over three years. The boyfriend was okay with their friendship initially because the girlfriend told him that their mutual co-worker, Sam, doesn't talk to many people at work and only interacts with her. He trusted her.\n\nNow, the girlfriend deleted some messages, and the boyfriend found out because her Fitbit messages didn't delete as quickly. Through this, he discovered a message where Jane referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend,\" which upset him. He then told the girlfriend that he wants to stop her from being friends with Jane because she's disrespective. The question is whether the boyfriend is in the wrong for cutting off the friendship based on Jane's use of the term \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend's main issue is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" by Jane. He's not okay with \"work husbands\" or joking around about such terms. But Jane and Sam might have been joking or using the term casually, which the girlfriend dismissed as just a joke. The girlfriend didn't confront Jane about it, leading the boyfriend to take it seriously.\n\nNow, the boyfriend's actions: he decided unilaterally that the friendship is over because Jane called Sam her boyfriend. Is that fair? Well, the boyfriend is in a position where he's making a decision about his girlfriend's personal relationships based on a single message. Even if he's jealous or trusts her, the way he handled it might be problematic. He didn't discuss it with the girlfriend first, or with Jane. Instead, he just decided to end the friendship. That seems abrupt.\n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend used the Fitbit to figure out what was deleted might imply he's not fully trusting his girlfriend. Even if she was lying about the deleted messages, the method he used to find out might come off as invasive. However, the girlfriend did delete messages, which could suggest she had something to hide, but that's a different angle.\n\nIn terms of the term \"boyfriend,\" it can be a term of endearment in some work environments. If Sam and Jane just use it playfully, it might not be romantic. The boyfriend is assuming it's a romantic relationship, but there's no evidence of that beyond one message. The girlfriend didn't correct Jane, but maybe she thought it was a joke and didn't see a problem. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own discomfort rather than concrete proof of any wrongdoing.\n\nAnother angle is the boyfriend's control over his girlfriend's friendships. Ending a three-year friendship because of one offhand comment could be seen as extreme. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the boyfriend was genuinely upset, he should have discussed it with his girlfriend and Jane to clarify, rather than cutting off the friendship entirely.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's initial trust in their relationship led him to accept the friendship, so his sudden change in stance might indicate jealousy or insecurity. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy is being questioned, and cutting off a friend based on a single message could strain their relationship further.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a right to feel disrespected if he believes that Jane is using a term that could imply a romantic relationship with another man. However, without clear evidence of an actual relationship, acting on a single message might be hasty. The key issue is whether Jane's use of the term was intended as a joke or not. If it was a joke, then the boyfriend's reaction is unwarranted. If it was meant to imply a relationship, then it's inappropriate. But the boyfriend doesn't have evidence either way.\n\nIn terms of the girlfriend's actions, deleting messages could be seen as trying to hide something, but again, without more context, it's hard to say. The boyfriend's method of discovering the messages (through the Fitbit) might have been sneaky, but the girlfriend's deletion is also a red flag. However, the main issue is the boyfriend's decision to cut off the friendship based on one message.\n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend's actions seem impulsive and controlling. He didn't communicate with his girlfriend or Jane, didn't give them a chance to explain, and made a unilateral decision. This could be seen as not respecting his girlfriend's autonomy in choosing her friends. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
