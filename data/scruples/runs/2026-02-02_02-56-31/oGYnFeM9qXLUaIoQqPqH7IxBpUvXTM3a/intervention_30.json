  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user initially was okay with the friend since the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to many people at work and only interacts with her. Now, the issue is that the friend referred to another guy, Sam, as her \"boyfriend,\" leading the user to cut off the friendship.\n\nThe user found out about the message because their girlfriend deleted texts, and they used her Fitbit to see the deleted messages. They confronted her, and she admitted she ignored the message. The user then told her they don't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because they don't respect the relationship.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, the user is worried about the friend's joke. But in a healthy relationship, friends can have jokes, and calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in a work setting might not be a big deal. The user is taking it seriously, which could be a red flag if they're being overly controlling. The girlfriend didn't engage with the joke, so maybe the friend was just being playful. However, the user's reaction seems extreme, cutting off a three-year friendship over a joke. \n\nAlso, the user is using the Fitbit to monitor messages, which might be an invasion of privacy. The girlfriend was deleting messages, but the user's method of checking her Fitbit for deleted messages shows a lack of trust. This could be a bigger issue than the friend's comment. \n\nThe user's main argument is about respect for the relationship, but cutting off a friend over a joke might be too harsh. The friend didn't mean harm, and the girlfriend didn't take the bait. The user might be overreacting, not giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user should talk about their feelings instead of making unilateral decisions about who their partner can be friends with. The user's actions could be seen as controlling. So, the answer might be that the user is in the wrong (A) because they're cutting off a friend over a joke and using invasive methods to check their partner's messages.\n"
