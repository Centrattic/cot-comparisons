  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The user is okay with the friend waving and talking to her since the guy (Sam) doesn't interact much with others. The issue arises when the friend refers to Sam as \"her boyfriend.\" The user found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, but they discovered this through her Fitbit. The user then decides to end the friendship because the friend doesn't \"respect them as a couple.\"\n\nSo, the key points here: The friend jokingly called Sam her boyfriend. The user is upset about this and wants the friendship to end. The girlfriend didn't address the friend's comment directly, and the user is holding that against her. \n\nNow, in relationships, jealousy is normal, but there's a line between being protective and being controlling. The user might feel that the friend's comment is inappropriate, but is cutting off the friend the right response? The friend might not have realized the comment was offensive, and the user is not the one in the friendship. It's the girlfriend who's friends with her and should address it. By cutting off the friend, the user is imposing their will on the girlfriend's personal relationships.\n\nAlso, the user found out about the deleted messages via the Fitbit, which the girlfriend isn't aware of. This could lead to trust issues. Even though the user believes the girlfriend is honest, the method of finding out might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they are taking control of their girlfriend's friendships based on a single joke. The friend might not have meant anything by it, and the user isn't the one to decide the friendship's fate. The girlfriend should address the issue with her friend if she's uncomfortable. The user's reaction seems overly harsh, especially since there's no evidence of any deeper issues between the friend and the girlfriend. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the user is in the wrong) because they're interfering in their girlfriend's friendship over a joke, not allowing her to handle it herself, and possibly violating trust by using the Fitbit to monitor her.\n"
