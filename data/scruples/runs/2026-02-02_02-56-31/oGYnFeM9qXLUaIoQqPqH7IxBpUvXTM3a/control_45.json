She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the girlfriend (gf) having a co-worker friend (Sam) who's been called her \"boyfriend\" by another co-worker. The author found out through a deleted message and now wants the gf to cut off the friend.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that the friend called Sam her boyfriend, which he finds disrespectful. He doesn't trust the friend and wants the friendship ended. But let's break down the points. The friend mentioned Sam as the boyfriend once, and the gf says she ignored it. The author uses the fact that she deleted messages, but then uses the Fitbit to find out. The key here is whether cutting off a friend over a single joke is excessive.\n\nThe author is acting out of jealousy, even though the friend didn't do anything wrong. The friend's comment was a joke, maybe not intended to disrespect the relationship. The author is punishing the gf for something that was a minor slipup. Also, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit) could be seen as manipulative. The real issue might be the trust between the couple rather than the friend's comment. The friend doesn't owe an apology for a joke, and cutting off a 3-year friendship over that is harsh. The author's reaction seems disproportionate. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
