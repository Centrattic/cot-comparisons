  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a history of deleting messages, which the user found out through her Fitbit. Now, the user is upset that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, a co-worker who's been described as not talking to others.\n\nFirst, the user's main issue is the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. They feel this is disrespectful to their relationship. But the key here is whether calling someone a \"boyfriend\" in the workplace is a legitimate reason to end a friendship. Workplace relationships can sometimes have casual terms, like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend,\" which are often just jokes or terms of endearment without romantic connotations. The user isn't okay with that, but they need to consider if the friend's use of the term was intended to be harmful.\n\nThe girlfriend's friend might have used the term in a casual way without realizing how it would affect the user. The user is taking a strong stance by cutting off the friend. The question is whether the user overreacted. The friend called someone a \"boyfriend,\" which the user finds offensive. But is that sufficient cause? The user is also using the fact that their girlfriend didn't address the comment as a reason, but maybe she didn't think it was a big deal.\n\nAdditionally, the user's method of finding out the deleted messages through the Fitbit might have come across as invasive. Even if the user's intention was to confront the friend, using a device to read messages that were deleted could be seen as an invasion of privacy. The girlfriend's initial trust in the user might be shaken if they're checking her messages through her Fitbit.\n\nAnother angle is the user's history of on-and-off relationships. The girlfriend has been in the current relationship for three months, but they've been together on and off for four years. This might affect the user's jealousy or insecurity, making them more sensitive to the friend's comment. The user's decision to cut off the friend based on a single message could be impulsive and not based on the friend's overall behavior.\n\nThe user is also assuming that the friend doesn't respect their relationship. Just because the friend used a term that the user finds offensive doesn't necessarily mean there's a pattern of disrespect. The girlfriend might value this friendship, and cutting it off could lead to resentment or conflict. The user might be overstepping by dictating who their girlfriend can be friends with based on a single instance.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's actions\u2014cutting off the friend over a casual workplace term and using the Fitbit to monitor messages\u2014could be seen as controlling and invasive. The friend's comment might not have been intended to harm, and the user's response might not be proportionate. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong.\n"
