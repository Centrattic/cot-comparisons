  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking if they're in the wrong after deciding their girlfriend can't be friends with a co-worker anymore because the co-worker called another co-worker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years. The user is okay with the friend waving at her and being one of the few people the co-worker interacts with. The main issue is that the co-worker called another man the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the user now wants the girlfriend to cut ties with the friend.\n\nThe user found out through a deleted message that the friend made this joke. The girlfriend claims she ignored it, and the user believes she should have told the friend that such a term isn't acceptable. The user is now cutting off the friendship because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nHmm, so the user is acting on a joke made by the co-worker. Is it reasonable to cut off a friend over a single joke? The co-worker might have been teasing or joking without ill intent. The girlfriend's friend might not have realized it could be offensive, but the user is taking it seriously. However, cutting ties over one instance seems extreme. Also, the user is using the fact that the friend made a joke as a reason, but maybe the context matters. If the co-worker is known for not talking to others and only interacts with the girlfriend, maybe there's a different dynamic. But the user's action is based on a single message.\n\nThe user is also in a situation where they're in a new living arrangement together, having been on and off for four years. Trust issues might be present, especially with phone-checking. The user's response to the joke is to end the friendship, which could be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend might feel that her social life is being controlled by the user's jealousy over a joke that wasn't directed at the user but at another person.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel that the friend's joke is disrespectful to their relationship. The line between joking and disrespect can be thin here. But the user is making the decision without giving the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. If the friend didn't mean any harm, cutting off the friendship might be unwarranted. The key here is whether the joke was intentional to disrespect the relationship or just a careless comment.\n\nAlso, the user is relying on a deleted message they found through a Fitbit. The girlfriend didn't know about the Fitbit messages, so maybe the user is being sneaky. This could add to the girlfriend's resentment, thinking her privacy is being invaded. The user's method of finding out might not be the healthiest approach, which could affect how the situation is perceived.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, is the user in the wrong? It seems like cutting off a friend over a joke might be an overreaction. The user is not allowing the friend to explain or make amends. The girlfriend might feel that her autonomy in her friendships is being overruled by the user's jealousy. Therefore, the user might be the one being unreasonable here. The answer could be A, meaning the user is the asshole because they overreacted and cut off the friend without proper communication. Alternatively, if protecting the relationship is a valid concern, maybe B. But given the context, A seems more likely.\n"
