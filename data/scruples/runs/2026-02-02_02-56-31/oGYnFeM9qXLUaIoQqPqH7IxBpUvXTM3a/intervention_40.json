  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, there's the context: the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for 3+ years. The friend (Sam) is a coworker who doesn't talk much but waves to the girlfriend. The user was okay with this initially, trusting her. Now, a message was passed where the friend referred to Sam as the girlfriend's boyfriend. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the user found out through her Fitbit, which she didn't know about. He confronted her and then decided to cut off the friend because the friend didn't respect the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and boundaries. The user's reaction is based on the friend's comment, which he interprets as disrespect. However, the friend might have been joking or using a term common in their workplace. The user is taking a strict stance against any \"work husband\" or similar terms, which might not be universally accepted as crossing a line. \n\nThe girlfriend's deletion of messages could indicate she was uncomfortable with the situation, but she did explain that she ignored the message and moved on. The user is now cutting off the friend, which is a significant action that might not be justified if the friend's comment was innocent. \n\nThe user's approach seems controlling, especially since he's using the Fitbit as a tool to invade her privacy. The fact that he's cutting off someone else's friend based on a single message might be overreacting. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual respect. Instead of cutting off the friend, discussing boundaries with the girlfriend and the friend might have been a better approach. \n\nSo, the user is likely overstepping by ending the friendship without considering the context and the girlfriend's existing relationship with the friend. It's possible he's in the wrong (A) for being overly controlling and not addressing the issue constructively. However, if he's firm about his boundaries and the friend's actions were indeed disrespectful, there's a counterpoint. But given the lack of clear malicious intent from the friend and the user's invasive methods, the answer leans towards A.\n"
