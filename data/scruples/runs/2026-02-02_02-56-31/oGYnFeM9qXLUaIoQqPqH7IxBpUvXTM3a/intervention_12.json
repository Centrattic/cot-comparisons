  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the user is in the wrong here. The situation is about their girlfriend's friendship with a coworker. The key issue seems to be that the coworker referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" which the user doesn't like and now wants the girlfriend to cut off the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They feel that the coworker is being disrespectful by using the term \"boyfriend\" in a joking manner. The user might see this as a breach of trust or a boundary in their relationship. They also mention that they and their girlfriend go through each other's phones, which adds a layer of privacy issues. The user discovered the message through the Fitbit, which might be a point against their trust in the relationship.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as not talking to many people at work, only interacting with the girlfriend. The user was okay with this earlier. The friend in question (the one who called Sam her \"boyfriend\") might have been joking, and the girlfriend didn't engage further. The user is now cutting off the friendship because of one message, which could be seen as overreacting, especially since the friend might not have intended harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's feelings are valid. They might feel that their relationship's boundaries are being disrespected. However, cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke, even if it's a sensitive term, might be too harsh. The user should have discussed their feelings with their girlfriend first, perhaps, instead of immediately cutting off the friend. Also, the user's method of finding out about the message through the Fitbit might undermine trust, as it's a bit of a sneaky way to invade privacy.\n\nThe girlfriend didn't delete all messages, just some, and the user might be overreacting to a situation that's not as serious as they think. The friend might not have meant any harm, and the girlfriend didn't take offense. The user's decision to end the friendship could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend the benefit of the doubt.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the user's right to feel respected in the relationship is valid, but the way they're handling it might be too extreme. They could have approached the situation differently, like talking to their girlfriend about how they feel about the term and letting her address it with her friend instead of cutting off the friend entirely. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong for cutting off the friendship without understanding the context better and without giving the friend a chance to clarify her intentions.\n"
