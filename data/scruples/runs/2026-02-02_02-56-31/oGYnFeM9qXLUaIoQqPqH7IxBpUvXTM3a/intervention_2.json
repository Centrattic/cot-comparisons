  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let me try to break down the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, the user is in a relationship with his girlfriend, who's been in a 3-year friendship with a coworker named Sam. The user is okay with Sam waving at his girlfriend since he's the only one Sam interacts with at work. But now, there's an issue where Sam's friend called him \"her boyfriend\" in a message, which the girlfriend didn't delete. The user found out through the girlfriend's Fitbit messages and confronted her. Now he wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with her coworker because the friend didn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether cutting off a friend over calling another coworker \"boyfriend\" is justified. Let's think about boundaries. The user is upset because he doesn't like the term \"boyfriend\" being used for someone else. But the coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people and only interacts with the girlfriend. The friend's message was a joke, maybe, but the user sees it as disrespectful.\n\nNow, the girlfriend didn't respond to the message. The user is taking a strong stance by asking her to end the friendship. Is that overstepping? Well, the user's point is about respecting the relationship, but the friend didn't know the girlfriend was in a relationship with the user when she called Sam \"boyfriend\"? Wait, the friend might have been under the impression that Sam is the girlfriend's boyfriend? Or is that a joke?\n\nThe user is okay with \"work husband\" jokes but not this. The key here is whether the friend was aware of the user's existence. If the friend didn't know the girlfriend was in a relationship, then calling Sam \"boyfriend\" might be a misunderstanding. If she did know, then it's disrespectful. But the girlfriend didn't correct her, so maybe she let it slide, thinking it was a joke. But the user found out through deleted messages, which he discovered via the Fitbit.\n\nNow, is cutting off a friend over this too harsh? The user is enforcing his boundaries, but maybe he's being controlling? The girlfriend's friend was joking, not being malicious. The user is making a decision for the girlfriend regarding her friendship. That could be seen as overstepping because friendships are between two people, and the user is dictating who she can be friends with. \n\nAlso, the user is using the act of deleting messages as a justification. The girlfriend might have deleted messages to avoid conflict, but the user is using that to question her honesty. The fact that he's monitoring her through the Fitbit might not be healthy either. Trust issues might be at play here. If the user doesn't trust his girlfriend, that could be a bigger problem in the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is making a decision based on a joke that might not have been intended as a slight. Cutting off a friend because of a miscommunication or joke could be seen as overly controlling. The user is also invading privacy by checking messages through the Fitbit, which adds to the issue. While he's asserting his boundaries, he might be overreacting and not allowing the girlfriend to handle her own friendship. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's being controlling and not giving the friend a chance to explain or correct the mistake.\n"
