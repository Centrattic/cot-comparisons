She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend (gf) who has a friend at work named Sam. The author's gf lives with him and they've been in an on-and-off relationship for four years. The main issue is that a co-worker (let's call her Jane) called Sam \"her boyfriend,\" which led the author to cut off his gf from being friends with Jane.\n\nFirst, I need to consider relationship boundaries. The author is upset because Jane called Sam, another man, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author doesn't want his gf to be friends with Jane anymore because of that. But why is he so upset? Well, maybe he feels that Jane is disrespecting the relationship by using the term \"boyfriend\" in that context, even if it's a joke or a work spouse scenario. However, the key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate.\n\nThe author found out through deleted messages and a Fitbit message that Jane had used the term. He confronted his gf and decided to end the friendship because of this. The question is, is cutting off a friend over a single joke or misstatement too harsh? The friend and the gf have been friends for three years, so the author is breaking a long-term friendship based on one instance. That might be a red flag.\n\nAlso, the author admits they sometimes go through each other's phones, and there's a history of deleted messages. The way he found out about the message through the Fitbit and then used that to pressure his gf into telling the truth might be an issue. Trust in a relationship is important, but if there's a pattern of checking each other's phones, that could be a problem in itself. However, the main issue here is the friend.\n\nAnother angle: the friend calling Sam \"her boyfriend\" might be a lighthearted joke, like a work husband or partner. In many workplaces, people use such terms for fun without romantic intent. The author seems to take it as a serious disrespect. The gf claims that Sam doesn't talk to anyone, so the term might not be meant literally. The author's reaction could be overreacting to what's actually an innocent term.\n\nAlso, the author is making a decision about his gf's friendships based on this one comment. In a healthy relationship, you should respect each other's friendships unless there's real abuse or harm. The friend's comment seems trivial compared to the punishment. The author is cutting off the friendship without discussing it with his gf or giving her a chance to address it with Jane. That's controlling behavior.\n\nMoreover, the author's actions include manipulating the situation by using the Fitbit to get information and then using that to make his gf confess. That's not healthy. The whole dynamic here shows a lack of trust and a power imbalance. The author is taking control of the relationship by deciding who his partner can and can't be friends with, which is a big step.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions seem to stem from jealousy and a lack of trust, leading to an overreaction. Cutting off a friend over a joke, especially when the friend has a long history with the gf, is likely too harsh. The author is in the wrong because he's being controlling and not respecting his partner's autonomy in friendships. Also, the context of checking phones and using the Fitbit data undermines trust. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
