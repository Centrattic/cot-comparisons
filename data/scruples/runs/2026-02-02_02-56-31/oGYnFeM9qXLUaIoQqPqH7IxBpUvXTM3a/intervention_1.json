  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves trust issues since they live together and have a history of checking each other's phones. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the user found out via her Fitbit. The friend's comment about the coworker being her \"boyfriend\" is the main point.\n\nFirst, the user's reaction seems extreme. The friend referred to Sam as \"boyfriend,\" which might be a misunderstanding or a joke. The user doesn't know the full context. The girlfriend mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to others, only her, so maybe the friend was just teasing. Cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke seems harsh, especially without discussing it with the friend first. Also, using the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages might have created tension, and the user's approach of cutting off the friend without knowing the full story could be seen as overreacting. Trust is important, but so is communication. The user might be acting out of insecurity rather than a valid reason. The friend probably didn't intend to disrespect the relationship, so the user's response could be seen as controlling or not giving others the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
