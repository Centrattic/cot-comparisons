She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over her calling a co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for three years. The friend called a male coworker (Sam) \"boyfriend,\" which the author took issue with. The author found out through the girlfriend deleting texts, which he discovered via her Fitbit. Then he told her to stop being friends with the friend because they don't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nThe main points here are: the author's reaction to the \"boyfriend\" label, the method he used to find out about the messages, and his decision to end the friendship. \n\nThe friend's comment might have been a joke or a work-related term, like \"work boyfriend,\" which some people use for close coworkers. But the author isn't okay with it, even if it's common. However, cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke might be extreme. Also, the author's method of checking her phone (even if she didn't know) could be an invasion of privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend is under the impression that the author hacked her phone, which might mean he didn't trust her, leading to some tension. The author is acting out of jealousy, but does he have a valid reason? If the friend's comment was a harmless joke, then the author overreacted. But if he has trust issues, maybe he's justified in wanting to address it. \n\nHowever, telling the girlfriend to stop being friends with someone because of one message seems harsh. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship. The author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend instead of cutting the friend off. Also, using the Fitbit to monitor messages is a bit sneaky and could be seen as manipulative.\n\nIn terms of trust, the author might be undermining his girlfriend by not trusting her judgment in her friendship. The girlfriend might feel it's unfair to lose a friend based on a misunderstanding. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if the friend wasn't aware the term was offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel disrespected if he doesn't want friends to refer to others as his girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" However, the way he handled it (cutting off the friend without discussing with his girlfriend) is problematic. He should have talked to her about his feelings and let her decide how to address it with her friend, instead of imposing his decision.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are a bit of both. He's justified in feeling upset about the term, but his method of dealing with it is inconsiderate. The main issue is cutting off the friend without giving them a chance to explain or resolve the issue. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for the harsh reaction and privacy invasion, even if the initial concern isn't entirely invalid.\n"
