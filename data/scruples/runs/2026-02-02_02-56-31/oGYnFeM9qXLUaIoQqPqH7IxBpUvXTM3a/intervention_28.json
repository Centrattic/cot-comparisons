  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the user is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend (gf) who has a friend at work, and the user is upset because that friend called another coworker the gf's \"boyfriend.\" The user is cutting off the friendship because of this, even though the gf might have just ignored the message. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The user found out that the friend made this joke, and now he's demanding the gf stop being friends with her. The user is using the fact that the friend called someone else the gf's \"boyfriend\" as a reason to end the friendship. But the friend has a history of Sam (the coworker) not interacting much with others, so maybe it's a joke among coworkers. The user is not okay with jokes or work husbands, which some people might find trivial, but he's taking it seriously.\n\nThe user also mentions that they go through each other's phones, which is a big red flag. The fact that they found deleted messages through the Fitbit is a privacy issue. The user might be overstepping by using surveillance to monitor their partner. Even if they found out that way, the reaction seems harsh. The friend's comment might be an innocent joke, and cutting off a friend over a single message could be extreme. The user is making assumptions about the intent behind the message without the gf's input. The gf might have a different perspective on why the friend said that or how it's used in the workplace context. \n\nAlso, the user is not allowing the gf to address the issue with her friend herself, which could have been a better approach. Ending a friendship over a joke that might not be intended seriously could strain the relationship. The user's reaction seems more about their own insecurity or jealousy than the actual content of the message. They might not be respecting their gf's autonomy in handling her friendships. \n\nConsidering all this, the user's actions are likely overreacting. They used invasive methods to find out the message, and their response of cutting off the friend is disproportionate. So the answer would be that the user is in the wrong (A).\n"
