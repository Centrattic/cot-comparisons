She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend (gf) and her friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" which the author took issue with and wanted to cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is upset because the friend referred to a male coworker as the gf's \"boyfriend.\" The author and his girlfriend have a complicated history\u2014on and off for four years, living together for three months. There's also the issue of them checking each other's phones, which adds a layer of trust issues. The author found out about the deleted message through the Fitbit, which the gf didn't know about. He then confronted her and decided to end the friendship because the friend's comment was disrespectful to him and the relationship.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main question is whether the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" is a legitimate reason to cut off the friendship. The friend might have been joking or using \"work husband\" terms, which are common in workplaces. The author seems to be taking it more seriously than the girlfriend, who dismissed the message. The author's reaction is based on feeling disrespected by the friend using the term, even though the girlfriend didn't think it was a big deal. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach was to cut off the friend without discussing it with the girlfriend, which might be too harsh. The friend's comment could be seen as a joke or a misunderstanding, but the author is taking it as a serious breach. The fact that the author used the Fitbit to check messages might indicate control issues or a lack of trust, which isn't healthy. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might feel that her friend was just being playful and that the author's reaction is over the top. The author's decision to end the friendship based on one message might be seen as extreme. However, the author believes that the friend shouldn't refer to someone else as the boyfriend without the couple's consent, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut the bigger issue is the method. Instead of talking to the girlfriend and the friend to address the problem, the author decided unilaterally to end the friendship. That could be seen as controlling or not respecting his girlfriend's autonomy in choosing her friends. The girlfriend might value that friendship, and cutting it off could cause more conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as overreacting and not handling the situation maturely. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he took a drastic step without proper communication and possibly overstepped his bounds in controlling his girlfriend's friendships.\n"
