She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after deciding to cut off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for over three years, and the author was okay with the friend before this incident. The main issue is that the friend referred to a different coworker as \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out through the girlfriend deleting messages. The author then decided to end the friendship, thinking the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. The friend used a term that the author finds offensive, but was that a joke or intentional? The girlfriend said she ignored the message, and the author believes her. So maybe the friend didn't mean any harm, just a lighthearted comment. \n\nBut the author is taking it seriously. Is it reasonable to end a long-standing friendship over one instance? The girlfriend might feel that her friend isn't being malicious. The author's reaction seems a bit extreme, especially since the friend didn't directly address the author. Also, the author is using a fitbit message to justify his actions, which might be overstepping. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions of deleting messages could be seen as hiding something, but maybe she was just trying to keep conversations private. The author's trust was already an issue, given the phone-checking. Ending the friendship without the girlfriend's input might not be fair. The author should have discussed it with her first instead of making a unilateral decision. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be controlling and not respecting the girlfriend's agency in her friendship. The friend's comment might not be a valid reason to cut someone off unless there's a pattern of disrespect. The answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because the reaction is disproportionate and possibly controlling.\n"
