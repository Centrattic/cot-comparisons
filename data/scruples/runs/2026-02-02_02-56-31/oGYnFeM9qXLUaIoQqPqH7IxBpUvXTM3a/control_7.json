She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for ending his girlfriend's friendship with a coworker who referred to another guy as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Jane) for three years. The coworker (Sam) doesn't interact much with others but does wave at the girlfriend. The author was okay with that initially. Then, through some Fitbit messages (since the girlfriend deletes texts but the Fitbit lags), the author found out that Jane called Sam \"her boyfriend.\" The author confronts the girlfriend, tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore because the comment disrespects him as the boyfriend.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key points here are jealousy and trust. The author might feel that Jane's joke is inappropriate, especially since there's a real boyfriend involved. However, the way he handled it is questionable. He didn't directly address Jane but cut off the friendship immediately. Also, there's an issue with the author's own actions\u2014checking her phone and using the Fitbit to monitor messages. That could indicate a lack of trust, which might contribute to the problem.\n\nThe girlfriend's side: She said she ignored the message and moved on. She might not have thought it was a big deal. The author's reaction seems extreme, especially since he didn't talk to Jane first. Ending a three-year friendship over a joke could be seen as harsh. Additionally, the author's method of finding out via snooping might undermine his position\u2014using deceit to justify his actions.\n\nCultural norms about workplace relationships vary, but calling someone a \"work husband\" is often considered a harmless joke. The author's intolerance for such nicknames might be overly possessive. The real issue might be the author's need for control rather than the coworker's comment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, his response is extreme. The method of using passive-aggressive tactics and cutting off the friend without addressing the issue directly makes him the asshole. The girlfriend's actions (deleting messages) might contribute to the problem, but the author's reaction is still disproportionate.\n"
