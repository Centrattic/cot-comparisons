  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The user is okay with the friend waving and interacting since Sam, the coworker, doesn't talk to others much. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, and through a Fitbit, the user finds out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The user then cuts the friend off because of this.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The user's main issue is that the friend made a joke about someone else being a \"boyfriend,\" which the user takes as a personal disrespect. However, the friend might not have realized it was offensive. The girlfriend didn't address it but moved on, and the user is now punishing her by cutting off the friend. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, relationships require communication. The user didn't talk to the friend directly but instead immediately cut her off. Maybe the user should have discussed their feelings first. Also, using the Fitbit to find out about the messages without the girlfriend's knowledge could be seen as invasive, even if she deleted the texts. \n\nBut the user's perspective is that they don't want their girlfriend associating with someone who disrespects their relationship. However, the joke might not have been malicious. The user's approach seems extreme. They're cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke, which might not be fair. The girlfriend's friend might not realize it's an issue, and the user isn't giving her a chance to apologize or clarify. \n\nOn the other hand, the user has valid feelings about being disrespected. The problem is the method of dealing with it. The right approach would be to talk to the girlfriend about their feelings and perhaps address the friend directly, not just cut her off. So, the user's actions might be too harsh. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, they are in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with proper communication and overreacted.\n"
