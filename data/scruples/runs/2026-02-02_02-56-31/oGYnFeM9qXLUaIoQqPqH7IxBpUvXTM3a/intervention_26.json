  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" They found out through deleted messages and the Fitbit. \n\nFirst, the main issue is whether the friend called someone else her \"boyfriend,\" which the user finds disrespectful. The girlfriend didn't seem to take the comment seriously and moved on. The user is now cutting off the friend because of this one instance.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Jealousy or possessiveness is natural in relationships, but cutting off a friend over a single joke might be excessive. The friend's comment might have been harmless, and the user's reaction could be seen as controlling. Also, the user is relying on snooping (via the Fitbit) to find out what was said, which might not be a healthy approach. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that her friend's comment was minor and not a reason to end the friendship. The user's action could be seen as overreacting and not trusting her judgment. On the other hand, the user might feel respected if a friend refers to another man as a boyfriend. But the key here is communication. Instead of cutting off the friend abruptly, discussing boundaries with the girlfriend and the friend might be a better approach.\n\nAlso, the user's method of finding out (using Fitbit) might have undermined trust. Even if they found out, how they handled it matters. The answer might hinge on whether the friend's comment was a one-time joke or a pattern. Since it's just one incident, the user's reaction seems harsh. So, the user might be the asshole here for overreacting and cutting off the friend without addressing it calmly.\n"
