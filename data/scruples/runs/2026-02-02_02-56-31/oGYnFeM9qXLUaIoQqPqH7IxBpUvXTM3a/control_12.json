She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called someone else her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has a friend, let's call her Friend X, who has been friends with the girlfriend for over three years. The friend works with Sam, a co-worker who only interacts with the girlfriend. The girlfriend initially told the boyfriend that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else, so the boyfriend was okay with that. Then, through Fitbit messages, the boyfriend found out that Friend X referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" in a message. The girlfriend deleted the messages, but the boyfriend figured it out via Fitbit. He then told the girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with Friend X anymore because he feels disrespected.\n\nNow, the question is whether the boyfriend is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend is upset that someone else is being called his girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which could be seen as a breach of trust or a joke that's not appropriate. On the other hand, he used a somewhat sneaky method (via Fitbit) to find out about the messages, and then decided to cut off the friendship without discussing it properly. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend might have been joking or using a term like \"boyfriend\" in a casual way, which the girlfriend might not have intended to be offensive. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh\u2014cutting off a long-term friend over a joke. Also, the boyfriend's trust issues are leading him to control his girlfriend's friendships, which might be an overreaction. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's perspective is that he doesn't want his girlfriend to be friends with someone who disrespects him. The problem is whether the friend's comment was really that disrespectful or if it was a minor joke. The boyfriend's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) could also be problematic, as it involves privacy invasion. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend and the friend instead of cutting off the friendship abruptly. His actions might come off as controlling, especially since the friend might not have intended harm. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend's reaction seems excessive. The core issue is whether the friend's comment was a big deal. Since it was a single message and the girlfriend moved on from it, the boyfriend cutting off the friendship without addressing it properly might be inconsiderate. Therefore, the boyfriend is likely the asshole here for overreacting and not handling the situation with communication.\n"
