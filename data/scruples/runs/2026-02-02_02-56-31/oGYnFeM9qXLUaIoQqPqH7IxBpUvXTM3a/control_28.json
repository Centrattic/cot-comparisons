She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because she referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author was initially okay with the friendship, trusting his girlfriend. The main issue arises when the friend calls a male coworker \"boyfriend,\" and the author, after discovering this through some sneaky methods (checking Fitbit messages), decides the friend no longer deserves to be part of their lives.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect their relationship by making that joke. But let's consider a few points. The friend's comment might just be a light-hearted joke common in workplaces, not indicating any romantic intent. The girlfriend herself says the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to anyone else, implying the interaction is minimal. Also, the author used the girlfriend's Fitbit to read deleted messages without her knowledge, which is a privacy invasion. \n\nThe author's reaction seems extreme. Cutting off a friend over a single joke could be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't engage with it. Additionally, the author's method of finding out the message by using the Fitbit is questionable and might undermine trust. The girlfriend had already deleted the messages, suggesting she felt the conversation wasn't important enough to keep, which might indicate she didn't support the joke either. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed their discomfort with the term \"boyfriend\" first rather than immediately cutting off the friend. The action taken might come off as controlling and not giving the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. The friend's comment alone, without further evidence of inappropriate behavior, isn't a strong enough reason to end a friendship. \n\nSo, the author's actions seem to cross a line by using deceit and making a drastic decision without addressing the issue directly with the friend. The answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
