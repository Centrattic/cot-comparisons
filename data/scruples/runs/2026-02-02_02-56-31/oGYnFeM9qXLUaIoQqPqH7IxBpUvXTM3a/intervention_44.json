  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user is okay with her talking to this coworker but now is upset because the friend referred to another guy as \"boyfriend.\" The user found out through deleted messages that the friend made this comment. The user then told his girlfriend to cut off the friend because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Trust and communication are key. The user didn't talk to the friend first; he immediately decided the friendship should end. That might be a problem. Also, the friend might have been joking, and the girlfriend did ignore the message, moving on. The user is cutting off the friend based on one comment. Is that fair? \n\nAnother angle: The user found out by checking the girlfriend's phone, which she deleted messages from. Even though he got the info through her Fitbit, he didn't confront her directly. Maybe he should have discussed it with her first instead of cutting off the friend. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend calling someone else \"boyfriend\" might not be a big issue. It's possible the friend was just using a term of endearment in a workplace context, which isn't necessarily crossing boundaries. The user's reaction seems harsh. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues with the person involved rather than cutting them off immediately. The user didn't mention talking to the friend to understand the context. He's making a judgment based on a single message. That could be seen as overreacting. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend might feel that her friend isn't being targeted for just a joke. The user's action might strain the girlfriend's trust in him, especially if she feels he's being controlling without understanding the full story. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the user's decision to end the friendship without addressing the issue directly with the friend and without fully understanding the context might be seen as the wrong approach. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
