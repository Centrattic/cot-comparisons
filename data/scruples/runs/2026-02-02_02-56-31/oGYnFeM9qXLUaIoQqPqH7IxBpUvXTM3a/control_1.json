She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend has a friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend,\" and the author is cutting off the friendship because of that. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and this friend have been friends for over three years, and the author was okay with the friend waving at her coworker, Sam. The problem arises when the friend refers to Sam as \"boyfriend.\" The author found out because the girlfriend deleted messages, and he used her Fitbit to see what was deleted. The friend made a joke calling Sam the boyfriend, and the author is now cutting off the friendship because he doesn't think the friend respects him or the couple.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and communication. The author's main issue is that the friend's comment about Sam being the boyfriend is disrespectful. But is that a valid reason to end the friendship? The friend might not have realized it was inappropriate. The girlfriend didn't correct the friend, which the author is upset about. But maybe the girlfriend didn't see it as a big deal. \n\nThe author also went through the girlfriend's phone and used her Fitbit data to find out about the messages. While he claims he already knew about the deleted messages, using the Fitbit might be a bit of a privacy invasion. However, he says he only read one message, but the act of using the Fitbit to monitor could still be problematic. However, the main focus is on the friend's comment.\n\nIs it reasonable for the author to cut off the friend over a joke? That depends on their relationship dynamics. If the author and his girlfriend agreed that such terms are not acceptable, then maybe. But if the friend was just joking without malice, cutting off the friendship might be overreacting. The author is taking a strict stance, but maybe the friend didn't mean any harm. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might feel that the friend's comment was a minor issue, and the author is overreacting. Communication between the couple is important here. Did the author and his girlfriend discuss boundaries regarding friends referring to others as partners? If not, then the author might be making assumptions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that the friend's comment is inappropriate and doesn't respect their relationship. He's upset that his girlfriend didn't address it with her friend. But maybe the girlfriend thought it was just a light-hearted joke. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling if he's not allowing her to maintain her friendship over a minor issue. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the friend without considering the context and the friend's intentions. It's possible that the friend didn't mean to disrespect the relationship, and the author is acting out of jealousy or a strict interpretation of what's acceptable. The method of finding out the messages through the Fitbit might also be a privacy concern, even if he didn't hack the phone directly. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. However, there's a balance here. If the author and his girlfriend had clear boundaries, then maybe he's not. But based on the information given, it seems like the author overreacted without proper communication.\n"
