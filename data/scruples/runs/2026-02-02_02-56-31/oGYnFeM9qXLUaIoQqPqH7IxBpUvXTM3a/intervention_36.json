  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend they can't be friends with her coworker anymore because the coworker called another guy her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years, and the user is now cutting off the friendship due to this one comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user and girlfriend have been on and off for four years and are now living together for three months. The user's trust might be an issue here, given they check each other's phones. The coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The friend called Sam the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the user found out through deleted messages. The user is now cutting off the friendship because they feel disrespected.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user is restricting the girlfriend's friendships based on a single joke, the girlfriend didn't confront the friend, and the user used a bit of a sneaky method to find out about the messages via the Fitbit. The user's reaction seems extreme for just a joke, even if it's a boundary issue. Friends calling someone else's partner as a joke can be a problem, but cutting off a three-year friendship over that might be too harsh. Also, the user's approach to trust (checking phones) might contribute to the tension. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy is being undermined. The user's stance is about respect, but the method and the ultimatum might be the issue here. So, likely, the user is overreacting and is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
