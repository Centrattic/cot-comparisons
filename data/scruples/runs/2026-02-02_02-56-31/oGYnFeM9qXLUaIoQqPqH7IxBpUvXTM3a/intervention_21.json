  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because that friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" Hmm. So the main issue here is the boyfriend's reaction to the friend's comment.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out that the friend referred to another guy as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The boyfriend then decides that the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship, so he doesn't want the girlfriend to be friends with her anymore. \n\nWait, but why is this a problem? The friend didn't do anything to him directly. The girlfriend's co-worker just has a friendly interaction with her, and the friend made a joke. The boyfriend is upset because the term \"boyfriend\" is being used, implying some kind of romantic relationship that isn't real. But the girlfriend says that the co-worker doesn't talk to anyone else, just waves at her sometimes. So maybe the friend is just being sarcastic or making a joke. \n\nNow, the boyfriend is taking this as a personal insult and cutting off the friend. But the girlfriend might have a long-standing friendship with this person. The boyfriend found out through sneaking into her Fitbit messages, which could be a red flag in itself. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, the boyfriend's method of finding out might be questionable. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend is making a judgment about the friend's intent without discussing it with his girlfriend first. The girlfriend says she ignored the message and moved on, so maybe she's already handled it. The boyfriend is now cutting off the friend without consulting her, which could strain their relationship. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect that a friend shouldn't refer to another co-worker in a way that could be misconstrued? Well, maybe, but it's a bit of a passive-aggressive situation. The friend might not have realized the implications, or it could be a work culture where such terms are used jokingly. The boyfriend is taking a strict stance against any such references, which might be too harsh. \n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend is using the Fitbit to monitor messages raises privacy concerns. Even if the girlfriend was hiding something, the method of discovery might not be ethical. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the boyfriend is reacting strongly to a friend's comment that might not have been meant seriously. The girlfriend's friend might not have ill intent, and cutting her off seems extreme. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as controlling or not respecting the girlfriend's existing relationships. Therefore, the boyfriend might be in the wrong here.\n"
