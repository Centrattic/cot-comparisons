She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over a joke about a co-worker being called \"boyfriend.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years. The author found out through some deleted messages that the friend referred to another co-worker as \"boyfriend.\" The author then decided the friend doesn't respect them and cut off the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here: The friend made a joke, maybe a light-hearted one, about a co-worker being the \"boyfriend.\" The author is upset because they don't want their girlfriend to be friends with someone who uses such terms. The girlfriend tried to move past it when she saw the message. The author is using the Fitbit to track messages, which shows some level of controlling behavior. \n\nIs it justified to cut off a friend over a single joke? Well, it's possible the friend didn't mean anything by it, especially in a work context where people sometimes use terms like \"work husband.\" The author's reaction seems extreme if there's only one instance. Also, the author's method of finding out (checking Fitbit messages) suggests they might have trust issues or are being overly controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is within their right to feel uncomfortable with someone referring to another man as their girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" But cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke might be disproportionate. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the author, and it's possible the girlfriend didn't respond to the friend's comment, which could have resolved the issue.\n\nThe author's approach of cutting off the friend entirely might be too harsh, especially without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. The fact that the author is using the Fitbit to monitor messages also indicates a lack of trust, which could contribute to the problem. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might be overreacting by ending the friendship over a single joke. The friend's comment might have been innocent, and the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit) shows controlling behavior. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not allowing the friendship to continue without a more thorough discussion with the friend first.\n"
