She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend (gf) and her friend's co-worker. The main issue is that the co-worker called someone else her \"boyfriend,\" and the author is upset and wants the gf to stop being friends with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his girlfriend have been on and off for four years and are now living together. The girlfriend has been friends with a co-worker (the girl, let's say Sarah?) for three years. The co-worker, Sam, is mentioned as someone who waves but doesn't talk much. The author was okay with that initially. \n\nThen there's the part about checking phones. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit that she erased messages. The inciting incident was a message where the friend called Sam \"her boyfriend\" and said he was late. The author then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore because of that message.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect them as a couple and that the friend shouldn't joke about calling another man \"boyfriend.\" He also believes the girlfriend should have told the friend to stop.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is communication and boundaries. The friend's message was a joke, possibly, but the author is taking it seriously. The girlfriend might not have realized the message was problematic, or maybe she thought it was harmless. The author's reaction is to end the friendship, which is a big step. \n\nIs it fair for the author to cut off the friend over a single joke? The friend might not have intended to disrespect the author, and the girlfriend might not have considered the implication. The author's jealousy or insecurity could be influencing his reaction. Also, the author found out through snooping (using the Fitbit) and then used that to confront the girlfriend, which might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014deleting messages\u2014could indicate she felt the need to hide something, but maybe she just thought it was a silly joke. The author's method of discovery via the Fitbit might not be trustworthy, as the girlfriend doesn't know about that, leading to potential misunderstandings.\n\nSo, the main question is whether cutting off a friend over a single, possibly joking message is too harsh. Also, the author is taking control of the girlfriend's social life, which might be an overreach. Healthy relationships involve communication and mutual respect, so the author should have discussed his feelings with his girlfriend and the friend, rather than abruptly ending the friendship. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's overreacting and not allowing for open communication. However, some might argue that the friend's message was disrespectful, so the author is justified. But the way he handled it without discussing it properly makes him the asshole.\n"
