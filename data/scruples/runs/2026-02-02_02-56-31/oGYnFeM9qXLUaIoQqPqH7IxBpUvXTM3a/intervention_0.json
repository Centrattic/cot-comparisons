  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years, and the user was okay with it before. Now, the issue is that the friend referred to another coworker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The user found out through messages that were deleted but visible via the Fitbit. The user is upset and wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with her.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong here? Well, the friend's comment was a joke or maybe just a term of endearment, but the user takes it seriously. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, so maybe she didn't take it as a big deal. The user is now cutting off the friend because they think it's disrespectful. \n\nOn one hand, the user might feel that the friend's comment is crossing a line by implying there's a romantic relationship that isn't there. On the other hand, the friend might not have meant anything by it, and cutting off a long-term friendship over a joke could be seen as overreacting. Also, the user is using the girlfriend's past of deleting messages to confront her, which might come off as controlling. \n\nThe key points here are trust, communication, and whether the user overstepped in ending the friendship. The user is making a decision for the girlfriend regarding her friendship, which might not be fair. The girlfriend might feel like her autonomy is being violated. So, while the user's feelings are valid, cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it with the girlfriend might be too harsh. \n\nTherefore, the user might be in the wrong because they're not allowing the girlfriend to decide how to handle her own friendship, and they're acting out of jealousy without considering the context of the joke. The answer is likely A (they're in the wrong).\n"
