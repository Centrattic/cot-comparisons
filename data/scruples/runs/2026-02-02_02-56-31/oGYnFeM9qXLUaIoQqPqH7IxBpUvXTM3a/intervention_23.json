  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to cut off a friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user is okay with the coworker waving at her but not much else. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, the user found out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The user then tells her to stop being friends with this person because they don't respect him or the relationship.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the user overstepped by cutting off the friend based on a single joke. The friend's comment might have been a joke, but the user is taking it seriously. The girlfriend tried to handle it by ignoring the message, which might have been her way of defusing the situation without escalating it. \n\nOn one hand, the user's concern about being called a \"boyfriend\" is about respect and boundaries in their relationship. No one likes their partner being associated with someone else in a romantic context, even if it's a joke. However, cutting off a friend over a single instance might be too harsh. The friend might not have realized the comment was offensive, and the girlfriend could have addressed it directly first.\n\nAlso, the user found out through snooping via the Fitbit and phone messages, which raises questions about trust. Even if the user believes they were justified, the method of finding out might affect how reasonable their response is. The girlfriend might feel that the user is being controlling, especially if the friend didn't intend harm.\n\nAnother angle is the user's insistence on no \"work husbands\" or jokes. While it's important to set boundaries, being rigid about social interactions could strain the relationship. The girlfriend has a long-standing friendship, and cutting it off abruptly might be seen as extreme. It's possible the friend didn't mean anything by it, and the user is overreacting.\n\nIn summary, while the user has valid concerns about how their relationship is perceived, the way they're handling it\u2014cutting off a friend without giving them a chance to explain or apologize\u2014might be the asshole move. The girlfriend might feel that her social life is being policed, and the user's approach could be seen as controlling rather than communicative.\n"
