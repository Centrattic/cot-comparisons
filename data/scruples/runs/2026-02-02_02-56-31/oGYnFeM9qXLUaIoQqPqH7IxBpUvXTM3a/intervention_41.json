  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker their \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this person for over three years, and the user's issue is that the friend referred to a male co-worker as her boyfriend, which he finds disrespectful.\n\nFirst, the user's main concern is about trust and respect. He mentions they've been in an on-again, off-again relationship for four years and have been living together for three months. He found out about the \"boyfriend\" comment through deleted messages, which he discovered via her Fitbit. He confronts her and then decides to end the friendship with the friend, asserting that the friend doesn't respect him or the relationship.\n\nThe user's actions could be seen as controlling. Ending a friendship isn't trivial, especially one that's been ongoing for three years. The friend's comment might have been a joke, as the user acknowledges some people refer to coworkers as \"work husbands.\" However, he doesn't give the friend a chance to explain or apologize. Instead, he cuts off the friendship based on one message. \n\nCommunication is key here. The user didn't discuss the issue with his girlfriend to understand her perspective on the friendship and the comment. He also didn't address the friend directly, which could have resolved the issue amicably. His method of discovering the messages\u2014using the Fitbit\u2014might be seen as invasive, even if he didn't hack the phone. The girlfriend's deletion of messages could indicate she felt the comment was inappropriate, but the user's reaction is harsh. \n\nAdditionally, the user's trust issues and history of checking each other's phones might contribute to a toxic dynamic. Ending a long-term friendship over a single, possibly innocent joke seems extreme. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the relationship, and the user's action could alienate his girlfriend, who values this friendship.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's approach is controlling and lacks communication. Ending the friendship without discussion might be seen as the wrong move. So, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
