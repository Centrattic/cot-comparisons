  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the user have been in an on-again, off-again relationship for four years and have been cohabiting for three months. The friend in question has been there for three years. The user found out through deleted messages (detected via Fitbit) that the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The user now wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with this person because they feel disrespected.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about control and trust. The user is using the deleted messages as a reason to cut off the friend. But the girlfriend might feel that the user is being overly controlling, especially since they've been in a complicated relationship. Also, the friend's comment might have been an innocent joke, which the user is taking seriously. \n\nThe user also mentions that the girlfriend's friend doesn't talk to many people at work, which suggests the friend might be isolating. The user's reaction could be seen as cutting off social support for the girlfriend without considering the context. \n\nAnother angle is the method of finding out about the messages. The user used the Fitbit to read deleted messages, which might imply a breach of privacy. Even though the girlfriend thought the user hacked her phone, the user's actions here could be seen as invasive. \n\nThe user is asking if cutting off the friend is justified. But if the friend's comment was a one-time joke and the girlfriend had already moved on from the conversation, maybe the user is overreacting. The friend might not have intended disrespect. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user's actions might be seen as controlling and not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships. The answer here is probably that the user is in the wrong (A).\n"
