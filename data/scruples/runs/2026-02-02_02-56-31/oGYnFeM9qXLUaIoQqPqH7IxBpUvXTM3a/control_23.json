She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a girlfriend who's been friends with a coworker for three years. The guy (author) found out through some deleted messages that the coworker called another guy her \"boyfriend\" (Sam), and now he's cutting off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" by the coworker. The author believes that the coworker doesn't respect him and the relationship by using that term, so he wants his girlfriend to stop being friends with her. \n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. The girlfriend and coworker have been friends for three years, and the coworker interacts with the girlfriend more than others. The author wasn't upset about the friendship before, but now, after finding out the \"boyfriend\" comment, he's cutting ties. \n\nThe term \"boyfriend\" might be a joke or a term of endearment in some workplaces, even if it's not meant to imply a real relationship. The author's reaction seems to be about feeling disrespected. However, the coworker's use of the term might not have been intended to cause harm. The girlfriend herself might not have seen it as a big deal, given that she deleted the messages but didn't address the coworker. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author could have talked to his girlfriend about his feelings regarding the term and why it bothers him. Instead, he decided to end the friendship abruptly. This might be seen as overreacting, especially since the coworker's action might not have been malicious. \n\nAlso, the method of finding out the messages\u2014using the Fitbit\u2014raises questions about trust and privacy. Even though the author didn't hack the phone, the girlfriend might feel that her privacy was invaded. That could be a red flag in the relationship, but the user says not to focus on that part. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's response is justified. Cutting off a three-year friendship over a possible joke might be excessive. The author could have addressed the issue directly with the coworker or discussed it with his girlfriend to find a resolution instead of cutting the friendship. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not giving the situation a chance to be resolved through communication. The key point is that the coworker's action might not have been intended to disrespect the relationship, and the author's response was to terminate the friendship without addressing the actual issue.\n"
