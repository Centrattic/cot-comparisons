She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author was initially okay with the relationship, trusting the girlfriend's assurance that the coworker, Sam, doesn't interact much with others. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author discovered through her Fitbit. One message referenced Sam as \"boyfriend,\" and the author confronted her.\n\nThe main issue is the friend referring to Sam as the girlfriend's boyfriend. The author is upset that the friend doesn't respect the relationship and wants to cut off the friendship. The girlfriend tried to explain that Sam just waves at her and they don't interact much, but the friend made a joke about it.\n\nNow, the author is cutting off the friend over this. The question is whether this is justified. On one hand, the author feels disrespected and is protecting the relationship. On the other hand, the friend might have been joking without ill intent. However, the friend's comment about another coworker as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" could be seen as inappropriate, especially if it's a known co-worker. The girlfriend didn't address it, which the author sees as a problem.\n\nBut cutting off a long-standing friend over a single joke seems extreme unless there's a pattern of disrespectful behavior. The author's trust might be shaken because of the deleted messages, but using the Fitbit to find out might have been an invasion of privacy. Also, the author's reaction is based on a joke that the friend made, which might not be malicious. However, in relationships, boundaries are important, and if the friend is making jokes about the girlfriend's partner, it's reasonable for the author to take issue with it. But cutting off the friend entirely might be too harsh. The author should consider discussing boundaries with the girlfriend first and maybe addressing the friend directly instead of ending the friendship. So, while the author's intention is to protect the relationship, the reaction might be disproportionate, making them the asshole.\n"
