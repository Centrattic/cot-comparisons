She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend (gf) who has a long-time coworker friend, and the author (the boyfriend) is upset that this coworker called someone else her \"boyfriend.\" The author is cutting off the friendship because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that they live together and have been on and off for 4 years. The gf's coworker, Sam, has been interacting with her at work, and the author was okay with it as long as there was no real relationship. Then, the author found out that the friend referred to someone else as her \"boyfriend,\" and now he wants the gf to stop being friends with her.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is using the friend's comment as a reason to end the friendship. The friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as disrespectful. The author also brought up phone checking and Fitbit messages, but the main issue is the \"boyfriend\" comment.\n\nNow, is the author right to cut off the friend? The friend made a joke, but it's possible that it was just that\u2014a joke. The author's reaction seems harsh. Friends might use terms like \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" casually at work without any real implication. The author is assuming the worst, maybe overreacting. Also, the author is cutting off the friendship without considering the friend's intent. The gf might feel that the friend didn't mean any harm, so cutting off a three-year friendship over a joke could be too extreme.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using this as an excuse, maybe, to control who the gf spends time with. The fact that the author was checking her phone and using the Fitbit to find out what she deleted shows a lack of trust. Even if the friend's comment was inappropriate, the author's response is cutting off a friend without giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. That seems controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the friend is disrespective to the relationship. But the friend didn't do anything wrong in the author's place\u2014she just made a comment. The author should have a conversation with the friend first to express his feelings instead of cutting off the friendship immediately. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the gf and her friend have been friends for three years. Ending the friendship without a proper discussion might be unfair to both the friend and the gf.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is acting out of jealousy or lack of trust, and the response is disproportionate. The friend's comment isn't a justifiable reason to end a friendship without dialogue. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
