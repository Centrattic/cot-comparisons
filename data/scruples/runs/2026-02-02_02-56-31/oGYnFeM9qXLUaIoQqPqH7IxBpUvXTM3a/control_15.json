She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing his girlfriend to be friends with a coworker after the coworker called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The author's girlfriend has a female coworker (let's call her Jane) who's been her friend for over three years. The coworker Sam, who's been there for three years, only interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this because the girlfriend told him that Sam doesn't talk to others and just waves at her.\n\nThen, the girlfriend and author go through each other's phones. She deletes some messages, but her Fitbit retains them. The author discovers a message where Jane refers to Sam as \"her boyfriend.\" The girlfriend says she ignored it, but the author is upset and tells her not to be friends with Jane anymore because she doesn't respect him or the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is cutting off a friend because Jane called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" But Sam is not in a relationship with Jane; he's just a coworker who waves at the girlfriend. So Jane's comment might have been a joke or a work-related term, which sometimes people use for coworkers. The author is taking offense even though there's no evidence that Jane intended anything inappropriate. \n\nThe girlfriend might not have told Jane to stop, but that doesn't necessarily mean Jane was being disrespectful. The author is acting on a single message, which could be a harmless joke. Cutting off a long-term friend over that seems extreme. Also, the author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages (which he found via her Fitbit) to accuse her, which might be manipulative or controlling.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014deleting messages\u2014could indicate she felt uncomfortable with Jane's comment, but she might have handled it differently. However, the author's response doesn't address the actual issue of Jane's comment but instead punishes the girlfriend by ending the friendship. This seems like overreacting and possibly controlling behavior.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend, the author should have discussed his feelings with both his girlfriend and Jane to clarify intentions. Assuming malice without evidence is problematic. The author's trust in the relationship might be shaken without just cause here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is acting unreasonably by ending the friendship over a likely innocent comment. He's not allowing for the possibility that Jane's use of \"boyfriend\" was a joke or a work term, and he's making a judgment based on a single message without context. That makes him the asshole here.\n"
