  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend (GF) and her co-worker friend, and the boyfriend (the person asking the question) is upset because the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" The BF wants the GF to stop being friends with the friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The GF has been friends with this co-worker for three years. The BF was okay with the GF interacting with this co-worker because she mentioned that the co-worker doesn't talk to anyone else, just waves at her. But then, the BF discovered through the GF's Fitbit messages that the friend referred to another co-worker as \"boyfriend\" when talking to the GF. The BF then cuts off the GF's friendship with the friend, claiming that the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries. The BF's main issue is that the friend used a term that implies a romantic relationship, which he finds disrespectful. But is that a valid reason to end a friendship? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the BF's method of finding out: he used the GF's Fitbit to access deleted messages. The GF had deleted texts but not the Fitbit messages. The BF used this to pressure her into revealing what she had deleted. This method could be seen as manipulative or violating privacy. Even if the BF had a reason, using a third-party device (Fitbit) to access messages without her knowledge might not be the best approach. It raises questions about trust and whether the BF feels the need to monitor her interactions constantly.\n\nSecond, the actual issue: the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" In many workplaces, people might refer to colleagues as \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" jokingly, especially if they have a close working relationship but aren't in a romantic relationship. It's possible that the friend was just using playful language without any ill intent. However, the BF is taking this as a personal slight and wants the GF to cut ties because of it. \n\nThe BF's reaction seems harsh. Ending a long-term friendship over a single offhand comment might be excessive. The GF might feel that her friend's comment was innocent and that the BF is overreacting. The BF is essentially deciding that the GF should end the friendship based on something that might not be a big deal to others. This could be seen as controlling or not respecting the GF's autonomy in her friendships.\n\nAdditionally, the BF's approach to finding out about the messages through the Fitbit and then using that information to demand the GF cut off her friend could strain trust between the couple. The GF might feel that her privacy was invaded and that her BF is not respecting her friendships. Even if the friend's comment was problematic (though that's debatable), the BF's method of handling it is questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, the BF might feel that the term \"boyfriend\" in the workplace is inappropriate and could imply that the friend is being disrespectful to their relationship. He might believe that the friend should be aware of the boundaries and not engage in such language. However, without a prior discussion with the GF and the friend, assuming that this is a problem without context could lead to misunderstandings.\n\nThe GF's response to the friend's comment was to ignore it and move on, which suggests she didn't see it as a big issue. The BF is then imposing his own interpretation on a situation that his partner didn't find problematic. This could indicate a lack of communication between them. Instead of cutting off the friend immediately, the BF might have been better off discussing his concerns with the GF and addressing them together, perhaps talking to the friend if needed.\n\nIn terms of whether the BF is in the wrong, the key factors are his method of discovering the message (using the Fitbit) and his reaction (ending the friendship). Both aspects could be problematic. The invasion of privacy through the Fitbit, even if it led to a valid concern, is a red flag. The reaction to the friend's comment might be overstepping, especially without the GF's agreement on the matter. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the BF's actions\u2014using the Fitbit to access messages and then cutting the friend off\u2014seem to be overreaching. The friend's comment might not be a valid reason to end a friendship, especially if the GF doesn't see it the same way. The BF's approach could be seen as controlling and not respecting the GF's autonomy in her relationships. Therefore, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
