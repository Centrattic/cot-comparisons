  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, been on and off for four years. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user found out via deleted messages (via Fitbit) that the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The user then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect them as a couple.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The user is expressing jealousy or insecurity about the friend's comment. The friend made a joke, but maybe it wasn't meant to be taken seriously. The girlfriend already told the user that the coworker doesn't talk to many people and only interacts with her. So maybe the friend was just making light conversation.\n\nIs the user overreacting? Well, they're taking it seriously and cutting off the friend. But the friend didn't do anything wrong necessarily\u2014just a joke. The user is acting based on a deleted message they found, which might have been a misunderstanding. Also, the user is using a Fitbit to track messages, which might indicate some level of control or lack of trust, even if they didn't hack the phone.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of deleting messages might be a red flag too, but the user is using that to justify cutting off the friend. The user is not allowing the girlfriend to address the issue with the friend directly, which could have resolved it. Instead, they're making a unilateral decision to end the friendship.\n\nSo, maybe the user is being controlling. Friends can have jokes, and the user's reaction might be too harsh. The friend didn't intentionally disrespect the relationship, just made a joke. The user should have discussed it with the girlfriend first, maybe talked to the friend, not cut them off entirely. So the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because they're not handling it maturely, cutting off the friend without giving them a chance to explain or apologize, and acting on jealousy based on a joke.\n"
