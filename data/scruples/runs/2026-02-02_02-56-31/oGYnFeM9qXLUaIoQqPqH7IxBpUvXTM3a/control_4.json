She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their girlfriend to be friends with a coworker who referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her \"Friend\") for three years. The author is okay with the girlfriend talking to this coworker since he (Sam) is the only one she interacts with. But then, the author finds out that the friend called another coworker (Sam) her \"boyfriend.\" The author uses a Fitbit message that wasn't fully deleted to confront the girlfriend. The author then demands the girlfriend to cut off the friendship because the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend and the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's main issue is the friend using the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. The girlfriend didn't respond to that message but moved on. The author thinks the friend is being disrespectful and wants the friendship terminated.\n\nFirst point: The author used the Fitbit to find out about the deleted messages. The girlfriend is unaware that her Fitbit is revealing deleted messages. The author's approach here seems a bit sneaky, using a method the girlfriend didn't expect. This might be manipulative, as they made her think they hacked her phone when they actually tricked her into revealing the messages. This could be a point against the author.\n\nSecond, the term \"boyfriend\" in a work context. In some workplaces, people might use such terms playfully and not mean anything romantic. The friend might have been using it as a joke or a nickname. The author is taking it as a serious disrespect, but the girlfriend didn't react to it, implying it wasn't a big deal. The author is now cutting off the friendship based on one message, which could be overreacting. The girlfriend's friend isn't actually in a relationship with Sam, so the term is likely not serious.\n\nThird, the author is controlling the friendship based on their own jealousy, not the girlfriend's actions. The girlfriend was the one who told the author about Sam's behavior, and she didn't engage with the message. The author's reaction seems more about their own insecurity rather than the friend's actions. The author might be projecting their own feelings onto the friend.\n\nFourth, the girlfriend's autonomy. The author is making a decision about her friendship without her consent. Even if there's a reason to be concerned, cutting off a friend is a significant action that affects the girlfriend's social life. The author should have discussed it with her and let her decide, rather than imposing their will.\n\nIn terms of trust, the author is using the Fitbit as a tool to monitor the girlfriend, which might indicate trust issues. The girlfriend is on the defensive, thinking the author is hacking her phone, which suggests a breakdown in communication and trust on both sides.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions are based on a minor incident (a single message that might be harmless), using underhanded methods to uncover the message, and making a unilateral decision about the girlfriend's friendships. This seems controlling and possibly inconsiderate of the girlfriend's feelings and the context of the friendship. The author might be overreacting and not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
