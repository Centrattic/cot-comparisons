  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for ending their girlfriend's friendship with a coworker who referred to another man as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (let's call her Jamie) for over three years. The girlfriend's coworker, Sam, has been interacting with her at work, and the user was okay with that. However, when Jamie calls Sam her \"boyfriend,\" the user takes issue. \n\nThe user found out about the deleted messages through the Fitbit, which they didn't know could store messages. They confronted their girlfriend, who admitted the messages existed but said she ignored them. The user then decided to cut off the friendship, feeling disrespected.\n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. In a relationship, trust and communication are key. The user's main grievance is the use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. While some workplaces might have \"work spouses\" or playful terms, the user feels this crosses a line. The girlfriend didn't address it directly with Jamie, which might have been a missed opportunity to clarify boundaries.\n\nBut cutting off a long-term friendship over a joke could be seen as harsh. The user is enforcing a boundary, but the method might be extreme. The girlfriend's friendship with Jamie is longstanding, and it's possible the term was meant in jest without malice. The user's approach of ending the friendship abruptly might be seen as controlling, especially since the girlfriend didn't engage with the joke beyond ignoring it. \n\nAlso, the user's method of finding out about the messages via the Fitbit raises privacy concerns, even if the girlfriend thought they were hacking. Trust issues here might complicate the situation. The user's actions could be viewed as overstepping, not just in ending the friendship but in the way they obtained the information.\n\nOn the other hand, the user is standing up for their relationship and feeling entitled to set boundaries. However, the appropriate action might have been to discuss it with the girlfriend and perhaps the coworker, rather than cutting the friend out entirely. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the user might not be entirely wrong in feeling disrespected, but their response could be seen as an asshole move because it's an extreme reaction and interferes with the girlfriend's personal relationships without sufficient cause.\n"
