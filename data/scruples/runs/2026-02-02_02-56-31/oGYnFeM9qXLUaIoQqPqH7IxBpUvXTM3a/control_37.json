She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years. The author is okay with her talking to Sam, a co-worker, as he's the only one Sam interacts with. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages. The author uses a Fitbit to find out she deleted a message where the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend disrespects them.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's reaction to the friend's joke, the method of finding out the deleted message (using the Fitbit), and cutting off the friend based on a single comment. \n\nIs cutting off a friend over a potentially innocent joke reasonable? The friend might not have meant anything by it, maybe just a work spouse joke. The author's approach seems extreme. Also, using the Fitbit to catch deleted messages suggests some level of mistrust, even if the girlfriend was hiding something, the author's method isn't healthy. \n\nThe girlfriend might have been trying to protect the author's feelings by deleting the message, but the author's response is to end the friendship. That seems harsh. The author's trust in the relationship is being tested, but cutting off a friend based on one joke isn't typical. The friend's action isn't a deal-breaker. \n\nSo, the author is acting out of jealousy and maybe insecurity. The method of checking the Fitbit is invasive. The conclusion is that the author is in the wrong for overreacting and not giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
