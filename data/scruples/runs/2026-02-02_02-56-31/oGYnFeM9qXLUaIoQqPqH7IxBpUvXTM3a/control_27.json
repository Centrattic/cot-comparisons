She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The friend jokingly refers to another coworker as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive. The author discovered this through deleted messages and the Fitbit, then decided the friendship should end.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are trust, communication, and boundaries. The author's reaction seems pretty strong\u2014cutting off a long-term friend over a joke. The friend might not have intended harm, and the girlfriend didn't take the comment seriously, brushing it off. The author's approach might be seen as overreacting, especially since the friend didn't know the author existed. Also, the author used surveillance (Fitbit) to find out about the messages, which could be a red flag for controlling behavior. \n\nBut then again, the author feels disrespected by the joke and is trying to set boundaries for the relationship. It's a gray area. However, cutting off a friend over a single joke, especially without the person knowing, might not be justified. The author could have addressed the issue by talking to the friend directly instead of ending the friendship. The fact that the girlfriend didn't take the comment and moved on might indicate it wasn't a big deal, so the author's reaction could be seen as inconsiderate of her feelings and the friend's intentions.\n\nAlso, the use of monitoring the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about the messages suggests a lack of trust and potential control issues. That's a bad sign. Healthy relationships require open communication, not spying. The author's actions might be undermining the trust in their own relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has feelings about being disrespected, the way they handled it\u2014cutting off the friend without direct communication and using surveillance\u2014makes them the asshole. They should have discussed their feelings with their girlfriend and maybe the friend, not just ended the friendship abruptly.\n"
