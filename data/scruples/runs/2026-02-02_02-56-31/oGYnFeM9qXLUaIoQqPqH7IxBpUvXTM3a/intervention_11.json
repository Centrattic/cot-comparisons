  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user is okay with their interactions as long as they're just coworkers. Then, the girlfriend deletes messages, and the user finds out through her Fitbit that she had a message where the friend referred to a co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" The user then tells her she can't be friends with this person anymore because they don't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the user is justified in ending the friendship over a single joke. The friend called a male coworker \"boyfriend,\" which the user sees as crossing a line. The girlfriend might not have taken it seriously, but the user feels disrespected. \n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, the friend made a joke, which is common in workplaces. However, the user has strict boundaries about not allowing such terms. The girlfriend didn't report it, maybe because she thought it was harmless. The user's reaction is cutting off the friend entirely. \n\nIs the user overreacting? If the friend's comment was a one-time joke and the girlfriend didn't engage, maybe the user is taking it too far. But if the user and girlfriend have agreed on boundaries regarding their relationship, the friend's comment might be a violation. However, firing a friend over one joke without addressing it directly might be abrupt. \n\nThe user used a sneaky method to find out about the messages, which could indicate trust issues. The girlfriend might not have intended to hide anything, just removed messages because she thought they were inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user is making a decision based on their own discomfort, but cutting off a long-term friend over a single, possibly innocent comment could be seen as harsh. The user might not be the \"asshole,\" but their approach has flaws. However, the main question is whether they're in the wrong. If the user's boundaries are clear and the friend repeatedly disrespects them, then maybe justified. But if it's a one-off and the user is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, then maybe they are wrong.\n"
