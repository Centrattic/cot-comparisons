  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not allowing their girlfriend to be friends with a coworker who called another coworker her \"boyfriend\". The girlfriend has been friends with this person for over three years. The user found out through some deleted messages that the friend referred to a male coworker as \"boyfriend\", even though the friend says the guy doesn't talk to anyone much and only interacts with the girlfriend. The user then cut off the friendship because they feel disrespected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's trust is a big factor. They mention they've been on and off for four years and together three months. Trust issues might be a root cause here. The friend using the term \"boyfriend\" could be seen as a joke, but the user isn't okay with that. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it, which the user is upset about. \n\nThe user's approach was to cut off the friend entirely. That's a significant action. Is it justified? Well, the friend's comment might be harmless, but the user's reaction is based on their personal boundaries. However, cutting off a long-time friend because of one joke, even if it's disrespectful, might be an overreaction. The user could have addressed the issue with the friend first, maybe by talking to the girlfriend about setting boundaries without cutting the friend out completely. \n\nAlso, the user's method of finding out about the messages was through the Fitbit, which the girlfriend doesn't know. This might lead to trust issues if revealed. The user is acting on partial information, maybe misinterpreting the friend's intent. The friend might not have meant it maliciously, just as a coworker nickname. \n\nOn the other hand, the user has a right to feel disrespected if they're in a committed relationship and the friend is using terms that imply a romantic relationship where none exists. However, the solution of cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it with them or the girlfriend first might be too harsh. \n\nSo, the user is in a tough spot. They have valid feelings but their response might be excessive. The answer would likely be that they are in the wrong (A) because cutting off a friend over a single incident without addressing it properly could be seen as an overreaction. However, there's a nuance here. If the user's boundaries were communicated to the friend, maybe the friend would have stopped. But the user didn't do that. Instead, they decided unilaterally to end the friendship. That's where the user might be wrong. They should have given the friend a chance to apologize or change their behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A.\n"
