She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend (gf) and her friend who called another co-worker \"her boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive and decides to end the friendship. The author wants to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially because he trusted her. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author discovered through her Fitbit. One of the deleted messages was from the friend referring to Sam as the girlfriend's boyfriend. The author confronts the girlfriend, who says she ignored the message. The author then tells the girlfriend to end the friendship because the friend disrespects him and the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author seems to be reacting to a joke from the friend. The friend called another co-worker the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author interprets as a serious issue. However, the girlfriend didn't find it offensive and moved on. The author is now cutting off the friend because of one message. \n\nI should think about whether this overreaction. Maybe the friend was just joking, and the author is taking it too seriously. Also, the author is using the deleted messages and the Fitbit as a way to monitor the girlfriend, which might indicate trust issues. Even though the girlfriend did delete messages, the author's method of finding out through the Fitbit could be seen as invasive. \n\nAnother angle: the author is enforcing a rule that others shouldn't refer to other people as the girlfriend's partner. But if the friend was just making a joke, maybe the author is being too controlling. Also, ending a three-year friendship over a single joke might be harsh. The girlfriend might feel that her friendship is being unjustly ended without her input. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the joke undermines their relationship. However, communication is key here. Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe discussing boundaries with the friend or the girlfriend could have been a better approach. The author's reaction seems impulsive and possibly based on jealousy rather than a genuine respect for the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author used the Fitbit to monitor messages without the girlfriend's knowledge adds to the trust issues. This could be a significant factor in why the author is in the wrong because it shows a lack of trust and violation of privacy, even if it led to the discovery of the message.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions\u2014using the Fitbit to invade privacy, overreacting to a joke, and cutting off a long-term friend without considering the girlfriend's perspective\u2014suggest that he is the asshole here. The right approach would have been to address the issue with the friend or talk to the girlfriend about their feelings without cutting off the friendship abruptly.\n"
