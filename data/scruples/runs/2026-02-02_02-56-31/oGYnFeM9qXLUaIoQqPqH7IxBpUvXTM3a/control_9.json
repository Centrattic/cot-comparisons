She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend has a long-time friend who's a co-worker. The friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out through some deleted messages revealed via the Fitbit. The author then told his girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with this person anymore because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend, Sam, only interacts with the girlfriend at work and waves at her. The author was okay with that initially. Then the issue arises when the friend refers to another guy as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author found out through messages the girlfriend deleted. The author used the Fitbit data to find out what was deleted, leading to a confrontation.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries, trust, and communication. The author's main issue is that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" in reference to someone else, which he finds disrespectful to his relationship. However, the girlfriend might see this as a minor joke between friends. The author then decides to end the friendship, which is a significant action.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the friend's comment might be harmless, just a joke among colleagues. The author's reaction seems based on jealousy and distrust, especially since he resorted to checking his girlfriend's phone (via Fitbit) to find out what was deleted. This method of surveillance could be problematic, as it's an invasion of privacy even if he thought he was justified.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the author is being controlling. Ending a three-year friendship over a single joke seems extreme. Also, the author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or apologize, which could have resolved the misunderstanding. The author's approach was to cut off the friendship without giving her a chance to address it, which is a harsh response.\n\nMoreover, the author's method of finding out the messages (using Fitbit data) shows a lack of trust and could be seen as manipulative. While he believes his girlfriend is honest, using technology to uncover what she deleted might undermine her trust in him.\n\nIn terms of whether the friend's comment was inappropriate, it's subjective. In some workplaces, people use terms like \"boyfriend\" or \"girlfriend\" jokingly. The author's disapproval is his right, but cutting off the friendship entirely is a heavy punishment unless there's a history of repeated issues.\n\nThe girlfriend's responsibility here is to communicate her boundaries with the friend. If she didn't address the joke, maybe she should have. But the author's response isn't about setting boundaries with the friend but cutting off the friend entirely without dialogue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions seem to be an overreaction. His methods of surveillance and lack of trust, along with an extreme response to a potentially minor issue, suggest that he's acting out of jealousy and control rather than a justified concern for the relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
