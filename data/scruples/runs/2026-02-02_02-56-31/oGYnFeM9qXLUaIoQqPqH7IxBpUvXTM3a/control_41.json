She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend\" in a message. \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The co-worker (Sam) has been interacting with the girlfriend at work, but she told the author that Sam doesn't talk to anyone else much. The author was okay with this initially, trusting her. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which the author discovered through her Fitbit. The deleted message included the friend referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author confronts her and, after finding out, decides the friend doesn't respect their relationship and tells the girlfriend to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author's main issue is that the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, which the author finds disrespectful. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The author believes she should have addressed it with the friend.\n\nIs the author justified? Well, the friend's comment could be seen as a joke or a misunderstanding, but the author is taking it seriously. However, cutting off a long-term friend over a single instance might be overreacting. The girlfriend's reaction (ignoring the message) might indicate she didn't take it seriously either. The author's use of the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages raises privacy issues, which could be another point against them.\n\nThe key here is whether the term \"boyfriend\" is problematic in their context. If the author is against any such nicknames or work relationships, then the friend might have crossed a line. But cutting off a friend based on one message seems harsh unless there's a history of similar issues. Also, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) might be a breach of trust, even if the girlfriend didn't know. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is making a decision based on partial information and possibly mistrust. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy in friendships is being undermined. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to clarify. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because cutting off the friend without discussing it with her and based on a single instance could be seen as overstepping, especially considering the method used to uncover the message. However, if the couple's agreement is that such terms are not allowed, maybe not. But the way it's handled here seems too abrupt and based on the author's judgment without considering the girlfriend's perspective.\n"
