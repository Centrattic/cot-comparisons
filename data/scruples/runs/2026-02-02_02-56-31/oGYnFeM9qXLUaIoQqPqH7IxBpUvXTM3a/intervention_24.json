  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because that friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" Hmm. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend refers to another co-worker (Sam) as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The user found out through deleted messages, which the girlfriend didn't delete from her Fitbit. The user then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect them as a couple.\n\nSo, the key points here: The user is upset about the label \"boyfriend\" being used for Sam. Sam is someone the girlfriend's co-worker has minimal interaction with, and the girlfriend had mentioned that Sam doesn't talk to others much. The friend called Sam the girlfriend's boyfriend, which the user finds disrespectful. The user is taking a strict stance against any such terms, even if they're jokes or innocent. The girlfriend didn't take issue with the term and moved on, but the user is now cutting off the friend.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" are often used jokingly or to denote close, platonic relationships. The user's issue is that they don't want their girlfriend to use those terms. The friend's use of the term might be a joke, but the user sees it as disrespectful.\n\nIs it the user's place to dictate the terms of their girlfriend's friendships? In relationships, boundaries are important, but cutting off a friend over a single term might be too harsh. The girlfriend didn't take issue with it, and the friend might not have intended any harm. The user's approach is based on the assumption that the friend disrespects the relationship, but there's no evidence of deeper issues beyond the term usage.\n\nAlso, the user found out through deleted messages, which might indicate some mistrust. The girlfriend might have deleted the messages to avoid conflict, but the user is using that as a reason to cut off the friend. That could be seen as overreacting. The user is also implying that the friend's joke invalidates the girlfriend's judgment of the situation. \n\nIn many cases, trust and communication are key. Instead of cutting off the friend, maybe discussing the issue with the girlfriend and the friend could resolve the problem. The user's decision to end the friendship might come off as controlling or not respecting the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendships. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is taking a very strict stance on a situation that others might view as a minor, joking term. The real issue might be the user's reaction rather than the friend's comment. Therefore, the user could be in the wrong here.\n"
