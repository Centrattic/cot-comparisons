She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the author live together and have been in an on-again, off-again relationship for four years. The friend in question, let's call her Jane, has been friends with the girlfriend for three years. Jane's coworker, Sam, has only interacted minimally with the girlfriend, mostly waving, and the author was okay with that initially.\n\nThe key issue is that Jane referred to Sam as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" in a message. The girlfriend deleted the message, but the author found out through her Fitbit. The author then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with Jane because she disapproved of the joke. The author also mentions that they both go through each other's phones, which might be a red flag in itself.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's reaction seems extreme. Cutting off a three-year friendship over a single joke, even if it's offensive, might be too harsh. The girlfriend might feel that the author is overreacting or not trusting her, especially given their history of on-and-off relationships. Also, the fact that they both snoop through each other's phones could indicate a lack of trust, which might be a bigger issue than the friend's comment.\n\nThe friend's comment could be seen as a joke, and the author's response of ending the friendship might not be proportionate. The girlfriend might feel that the friend didn't intend harm, and cutting her off could cause unnecessary strain. The author might be projecting their own insecurities due to the on-again, off-again relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's concern about respect and boundaries is valid. If the friend made a joke that the author found disrespectful, it's understandable to want the girlfriend to address it. But cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it with her might be too much. The author should have talked to the girlfriend about expressing the issue rather than making a unilateral decision.\n\nGiven all this, the author's actions seem to be in the wrong. They overreacted, didn't communicate their feelings properly, and used the snooping as a way to confront the situation without considering the girlfriend's perspective. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
