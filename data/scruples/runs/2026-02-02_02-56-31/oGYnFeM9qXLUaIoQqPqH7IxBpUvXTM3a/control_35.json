She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend (GF) has a friend at work who's been around for three years. The GF's coworker, Sam, isn't very social but waves at the GF. The author was okay with this because the GF told him that Sam doesn't talk to others much.\n\nNow, the issue arises when the GF's friend refers to another coworker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author finds out through the GF deleting messages, which he discovers via her Fitbit. The GF claims she ignored the message, but the author is upset and wants the GF to cut off the friendship because the friend doesn't respect him as a partner.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The GF has a three-year friend who's a coworker. Sam is the one who interacts with the GF, but the friend calls another coworker Sam her \"boyfriend.\" The author feels this is a boundary violation and wants the GF to stop being friends with her. The GF deletes messages, which the author discovers through her Fitbit. He confronts her, and she tells him she ignored the message. He then tells her to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, let's consider the dynamics. The GF's friend made a joke by referring to another coworker as her \"boyfriend,\" which the author takes seriously. The author is enforcing a boundary around how others should refer to other people in the workplace, especially since the GF is in a committed relationship. The GF didn't tell the friend to stop, which the author sees as a failure in communication and respect.\n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping? The GF has been friends with this person for three years, and the author is now asking her to end that friendship based on one message. The GF did delete the messages, possibly to avoid conflict, but the author used the Fitbit data to find out. The GF might have her reasons for not confronting her friend, maybe workplace sensitivity or fear of conflict.\n\nThe author's reaction is to cut off the friendship entirely, which is a significant step. Is it fair for him to dictate who his GF can be friends with? Even if there's a boundary about how others refer to other people, ending a friendship might be too harsh. The GF might feel that her autonomy is being restricted. Also, the author is using the GF's message deletion as a way to justify his actions, which could be seen as manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a committed relationship and might feel that his partner's friends shouldn't be using terms that imply a romantic relationship with someone else. The GF didn't address the issue, so the author steps in. But is it his place to decide that? The GF might have handled the situation differently, but the author is imposing his will here.\n\nAnother angle: the GF's friend made a joke, which the GF ignored. The author is taking this as a personal disrespect. However, work relationships can have casual terms, and \"boyfriend\" might be a joke. The author's reaction might be based on insecurity or jealousy. Ending a friendship over a single joke could be excessive, especially if the GF doesn't see it as a problem.\n\nAlso, the GF deleted messages, which the author uses against her. Maybe she was trying to keep the peace or not escalate a minor workplace joke. The author's method of finding out through the Fitbit and then confronting her might be manipulative. The GF might feel betrayed that her partner is using tech to monitor her, even if she's the one deleting messages.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed his feelings with the GF first instead of taking the step of cutting off her friend. The GF might need to address the friend's comment, but the author's approach of ending the friendship without the GF's consent is controlling.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is being controlling by dictating who his GF can be friends with. He didn't communicate his boundaries effectively and instead used a discovered message to justify cutting off the friendship. The GF's friend's comment might be a minor issue, but the author's response is disproportionate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
