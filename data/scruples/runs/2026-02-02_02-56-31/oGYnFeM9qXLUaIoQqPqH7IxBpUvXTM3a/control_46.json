She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author seems okay with the friendship initially, as he trusted his girlfriend's word that the coworker (Sam) doesn't interact much with others. Then, the friend refers to another coworker (Sam) as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds offensive.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication. The author discovered the friend's comment through his girlfriend deleting messages, which he found out via her Fitbit. He then confronts her and decides to end the friendship with the friend. The author's reasoning is that the friend doesn't respect him as her boyfriend and the relationship.\n\nBut is cutting off a friend over a single joke justified? The friend might have been joking or using \"work husband\" terminology, which is common in workplaces. The girlfriend didn't engage with the comment and moved on, so maybe she didn't see it as a big issue. The author is enforcing a personal boundary here, but reacting by ending the friendship might be overreacting, especially since the friend didn't know he existed. Also, the author's method of finding out (through Fitbit) might have led to a misunderstanding. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend's comment was possibly a joke, and the author is taking it seriously without giving the friend a chance to explain. The author is also not allowing any \"work husband\" relationships, which might be too strict. Relationships require communication, and instead of cutting off the friend immediately, discussing boundaries with his girlfriend and maybe the friend could have been better. \n\nSo, the author's actions seem a bit controlling and possibly overreacting. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because cutting off a friend based on a joke and not allowing any work-related nicknames might be too harsh. However, if the author feels disrespected, there's a case for B (not in the wrong). But considering the context, the friend's comment was likely innocent, so A makes more sense. The main issue is the author's reaction being too extreme without proper communication.\n"
