  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the background: The girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend (Sam) is a co-worker who doesn't interact much with others, just waves at her. The user was okay with this initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and the user found out through her Fitbit that the friend referred to Sam as her boyfriend. The user then told the girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect them as a couple.\n\nSo, is the user the asshole here? Let's break it down. The friend called Sam \"boyfriend,\" but the girlfriend says Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. The friend might have been joking or just using a term they're comfortable with. The user is taking offense because they don't like the idea of their girlfriend having a friend who uses such terms, even if it's innocent. \n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The girlfriend didn't tell her friend to stop using that term, but the user is now cutting off the friendship. Is it reasonable to end a three-year friendship over a single joke? Also, the user is using the Fitbit to monitor messages, which might be an invasion of privacy. Even if the friend's comment was inappropriate, cutting off the friend because of one instance might be too harsh. The user's reaction seems extreme, especially since the girlfriend didn't engage with the message and the friend might not have been aware they were overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, the user feels disrespected, and it's their right to feel that way. However, the way they handled it\u2014cutting off the friend without discussing it with the girlfriend first\u2014might not be the best approach. The girlfriend might have thought it was a harmless joke and could have addressed it herself. The user's actions could strain the relationship with the girlfriend as well, especially if the friendship was important to her.\n\nIn terms of trust, the user's trust might be shaken, but reacting by cutting off the friend without giving the girlfriend a chance to handle it might not be fair. The friend's action was minor, and the user's response is proportionally heavy. The girlfriend's deletion of messages might indicate she was trying to avoid conflict, which the user used to their advantage. This could lead to further resentment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's actions seem to overreact to a situation that might not have been as serious as they made it out to be. The decision to end the friendship based on a single incident without giving the friend a chance to explain or correct their behavior might be unjust. Therefore, the user is likely in the wrong.\n"
