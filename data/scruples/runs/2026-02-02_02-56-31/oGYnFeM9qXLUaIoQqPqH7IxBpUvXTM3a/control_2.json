She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years. The author seems okay with their friendship initially, trusting her when she said the coworker (Sam) doesn't talk to anyone else. Then, there's an incident where the friend refers to Sam as \"her boyfriend,\" which the girlfriend deletes messages about. The author finds out through her Fitbit, confronts her, and then decides to end the friendship.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and communication. The author trusted the girlfriend's initial explanation about Sam. The friend's comment was a joke, but the author feels it's disrespectful. However, the girlfriend didn't act on the joke, moved the conversation along, and the author's reaction seems extreme\u2014cutting off a long-term friendship over a single joke. \n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit to monitor messages she deleted, which might indicate a lack of trust. Even if he found out indirectly, cutting off a friend based on a joke without discussing it with the girlfriend first could be seen as overreacting. The friend's actions were a joke, not a serious boundary violation. The author's decision to end the friendship without the girlfriend's input might not consider her perspective and the value of her long-term friendship.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the way he handled it\u2014without open communication and overreacting\u2014might make him the asshole here. The answer is likely A.\n"
