She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the main issue is the friend referring to Sam as \"her boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for over three years, and the coworker only interacts with her. The author found out through deleted messages (via Fitbit data) that the friend made a comment about Sam being her boyfriend. The author then decides the friend doesn't respect him and ends the friendship.\n\nSo, is the author justified? Well, the friend's comment is problematic. Even if it was a joke, using \"boyfriend\" can be seen as inappropriate if there's no mutual romantic interest. The girlfriend didn't address it, which might be a red flag. But cutting off a friend over a single joke might be extreme. The author's reaction is based on a lack of trust, even though the girlfriend was honest about the friendship. The act of deleting messages could indicate something, but the friend's comment is the main issue here. \n\nHowever, the author's approach\u2014cutting off the friend entirely\u2014might be a bit harsh. Maybe a discussion with the friend to address the comment would be more constructive. Also, the author's insistence on no \"work husbands\" seems a bit controlling. The girlfriend didn't act on the comment, but the author is making a big deal about it. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's use of \"boyfriend\" could be seen as disrespectful to the relationship. The author has the right to feel disrespected. But the solution of cutting off the friend might be too drastic. The author could have approached the situation differently, like talking to the friend directly or discussing boundaries. \n\nIn terms of the author's actions, he's reacting to a breach of trust, even if it's minor. The girlfriend's friend made an inappropriate comment, and the author is taking a stand. However, ending the friendship might not be the best response. The author might be overreacting, but it's understandable given the context. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call. The key points are the friend's inappropriate comment and the author's right to set boundaries. However, the method of ending the friendship could be questioned. But the main issue is the friend's actions, so the author's stance isn't entirely wrong.\n"
