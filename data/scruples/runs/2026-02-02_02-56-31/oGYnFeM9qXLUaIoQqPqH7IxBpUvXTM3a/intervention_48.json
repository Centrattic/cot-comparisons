  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because that friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" So, the key points here are the user's reaction to the friend's comment and the subsequent decision to end the friendship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user was initially okay with the coworker being a friend, as he waves to her and doesn't talk to many others. Then, the user found out through deleted messages (via Fitbit) that the friend referred to another coworker as \"boyfriend.\" The user then told his girlfriend to cut off the friend because the friend doesn't respect them as a couple.\n\nNow, the user is wondering if they're in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. The friend called someone else \"boyfriend,\" which the user took as a jab at their relationship. However, the friend might have been joking or using a common workplace term. The user's method of finding out about the messages (via Fitbit) seems a bit sneaky, even if the girlfriend didn't know. Also, cutting off a friend based on one comment might be overreacting, especially since the girlfriend said she ignored the message.\n\nThe user's trust in the relationship might be shaken, but reacting by cutting off the friend without discussing it with the girlfriend could be seen as possessive or controlling. The girlfriend might feel that her social connections are being unfairly restricted. On the other hand, the user might feel disrespected and want to protect the relationship's boundaries. However, the way he approached it\u2014without the girlfriend's input and based on a single message\u2014could be problematic.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The user should have discussed their feelings about the term with the girlfriend first rather than making a unilateral decision to end the friendship. The girlfriend might feel that the user is overstepping, especially since the context of the joke might be different. The user's method of surveillance (using Fitbit) also adds a layer of mistrust, which could be an issue in itself.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the user's reaction seems a bit harsh and possibly controlling. They might not be in the wrong for feeling disrespected, but the way they handled it could be the problem. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (they are the asshole) because of the overreaction and lack of communication. However, if the user's stance is about setting boundaries, it's a bit more nuanced. But given the situation, cutting off a friend over a single joke is likely over the line. So, Answer A.\n"
