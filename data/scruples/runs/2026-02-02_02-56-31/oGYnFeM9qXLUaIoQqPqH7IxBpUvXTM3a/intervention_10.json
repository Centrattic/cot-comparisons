  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called someone else her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out through some tech stuff that the friend made a joke about another coworker being her boyfriend. The user is upset and wants the friend to stop being in contact. \n\nHmm, the key points here are trust and boundaries. The user and his girlfriend have a history of checking each other's phones, which might not be healthy. The girl deleted messages, which the boyfriend found out via her Fitbit. The friend's comment was a joke, but the boyfriend took it as disrespect.\n\nIs it wrong to be protective? Maybe, but the way he's handling it could be an issue. Cutting off a friend over a joke might be too harsh. Also, the boyfriend's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) seems a bit manipulative. Plus, the girlfriend didn't act on the message, just moved past it, which shows she didn't endorse the joke. \n\nThe main question is whether the boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate. The friend didn't know they were in a relationship? Or did they? The girlfriend's friend might have been joking, but using \"boyfriend\" in a workplace context could be seen as inappropriate if they knew they were in a relationship. However, the boyfriend's response is cutting off the friend entirely, which might be too extreme. \n\nAlso, the user's trust issues might be causing problems. If the girlfriend was honest about the situation and the friend was just joking, maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. But if the friend made a habit of disrespecting the relationship, then maybe it's justified. However, one joke doesn't necessarily justify losing a friend. \n\nSo, considering all this, the boyfriend is acting out of jealousy and lack of trust. The method of finding out is sneaky, and the punishment is harsh. Probably, the answer is A (he's the asshole) because he's cutting off a friend over a joke and using underhanded methods to find out. But maybe not everyone would agree. Some might think it's okay to set boundaries. But I think the extreme reaction makes him the asshole.\n"
