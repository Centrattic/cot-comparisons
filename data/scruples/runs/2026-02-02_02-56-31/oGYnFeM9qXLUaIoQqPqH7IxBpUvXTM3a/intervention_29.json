  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The user is okay with the friend waving at her coworker Sam, but now the friend jokingly refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The user found out through deleted messages and used the Fitbit to discover this. He then told his girlfriend to stop being friends with her because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The user didn't address the issue directly with the friend or the girlfriend first. Instead, they took a drastic step of cutting off the friend based on a single message. The girlfriend might feel that her friend's comment was a harmless joke, not meant to disrespect their relationship. The user's approach seems impulsive and controlling, especially since they used sneaky methods (checking Fitbit) to find out about the deleted messages. Trust is important, but so is respect for boundaries and open communication. Cutting off a friend without discussing it might be seen as overreacting, especially if the friend didn't intend any harm. The user's actions could damage trust in the relationship as well. So, the answer is likely A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
