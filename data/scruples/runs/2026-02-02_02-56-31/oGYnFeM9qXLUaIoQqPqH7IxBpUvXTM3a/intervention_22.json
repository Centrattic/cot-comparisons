  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because that friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this person for three years, and the coworker, Sam, has been interacting with her for a while. The user is okay with the interaction initially. Then, the friend calls Sam her \"boyfriend\" in a message. The user finds out because the girlfriend deleted messages, and through her Fitbit, he sees the deleted content.\n\nHe confronts her, and she explains she ignored the message. The user then tells her to stop being friends with the friend because they don't respect him as a partner. The main issue here is whether the user overreacted by cutting off the friendship.\n\nOn one hand, the friend's comment was inappropriate, and the girlfriend didn't address it. The user might feel disrespected. But on the other hand, the friend might have been joking, and the user is taking a very strict stance without considering context. The user also used the girlfriend's Fitbit to find out about the messages, which could be seen as a privacy issue. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend didn't know about the Fitbit tracking, so there's an element of her not being fully honest, but the user's decision to cut off the friend seems harsh. The friend might not have intended to be disrespectful, and cutting off a three-year friendship over one comment is extreme. The user's actions could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend a chance to explain or apologize. \n\nSo, while the friend's comment was wrong, the user's response was disproportionate. The answer is A (they are in the wrong) because their reaction is too harsh and controlling.\n"
