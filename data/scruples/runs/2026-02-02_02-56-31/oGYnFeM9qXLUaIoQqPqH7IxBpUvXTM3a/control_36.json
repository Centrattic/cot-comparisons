She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend (gf) and her co-worker friend. The girlfriend has been friends with this co-worker for three years, and the co-worker, Sam, only interacts with her. The author (the boyfriend) is okay with that because he trusts her. But then, the girlfriend deletes messages, and through the Fitbit, he finds out that the friend called another co-worker \"boyfriend.\" The author then decides the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with her anymore because the friend disrespects him and the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend didn't tell the author about the messages until he found out through the Fitbit. But she did delete them, which he used to confront her. The friend called another man \"boyfriend,\" which the author sees as a problem. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on, and he believes her because she thinks he hacked her phone.\n\nNow, the key points are: Is it wrong for the author to cut off the friendship because of a joke? Does the friend's comment really violate any boundaries? The author is upset that the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend. But is cutting off the friendship too extreme? The girlfriend had a three-year friendship, and the author is now ending it based on one message. Also, the author's approach of threatening to end the friendship if she continues is controlling. He's using the knowledge of deleted messages to pressure her into telling him everything, which might be an invasion of privacy.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the friend's comment was a harmless joke, common in workplaces. The author's reaction might be over the top, especially since he trusted her initially. Also, the fact that he's using the Fitbit data to monitor her could indicate trust issues and potentially controlling behavior. The author is not allowing her to maintain a long-time friendship without any explanation, which could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be overreacting. The friend's comment doesn't necessarily show disrespect towards him; it's more of a casual joke. The author's decision to sever the friendship based on that might be too harsh. Additionally, his methods of checking her phone and using the Fitbit data to confront her could undermine trust and autonomy in the relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A). However, if he genuinely feels disrespected, there's a balance between his feelings and her right to friendships. But given the circumstances, his actions seem excessive, so answer A.\n"
