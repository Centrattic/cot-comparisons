  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend referred to a male coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend and the friend have been close for three years, and the coworker (Sam) only interacts with her. The user found out through deleted messages that the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which upset him. He then told his girlfriend to end the friendship.\n\nThe user's main argument is that the friend disrespects their relationship by using such a term. But is it reasonable to cut off a friend over a joke or a nickname? It depends on the context. If the friend is joking and there's no actual relationship, maybe it's just harmless. However, the user might feel that any reference to another man as a boyfriend is unacceptable, which is a personal boundary.\n\nBut there's also the issue of how the user found out. The girlfriend deleted messages, and the user used the Fitbit to see them. Even though the user believes the friend was joking, the method of discovery might have involved some privacy invasion. The girlfriend didn't know the user was reading her Fitbit messages, which could be a trust issue.\n\nMoreover, the user is taking a strict stance against any \"work husband\" or similar terms, which might be too rigid. Some people use such terms playfully without romantic intent. The user is expecting the girlfriend to correct her friend, but maybe the friend didn't realize it was an issue, or the girlfriend didn't want to cause tension at work.\n\nThe user is cutting off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. Is that fair? The friend might not have meant any harm. Ending a long-term friendship over a single message could be seen as an overreaction unless there's a history of similar issues.\n\nAlso, the user's approach might come across as controlling. Trust is important in a relationship, but demanding that a friend be cut off based on one instance could strain the relationship between the couple. It's possible the user is reacting more to the act of the friend using the term than the term itself, which might not be warranted.\n\nIn summary, while the user has a right to feel uncomfortable, cutting off a friend over a joke might be too harsh without further discussion or understanding the context. It's possible the user is overreacting and not considering the friend's intentions or the girlfriend's relationship with her friend. So, the answer would be that the user is in the wrong.\n"
