  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The user found out through the Fitbit that the friend had referred to Sam as the girlfriend's boyfriend, and now they don't want the girlfriend to be friends with her anymore.\n\nFirst, the key points here are trust and communication. The girlfriend had mentioned before that Sam (the coworker) only interacts with her, and the user trusted her. The friend's comment was probably a joke or a light-hearted way to refer to a work relationship, but the user took it as a serious disrespect.\n\nThe user's reaction is to cut off the friend entirely. That seems pretty extreme. While it's understandable to feel upset about being called the boyfriend without being the actual partner, ending a 3-year friendship over a single joke might be overreacting. The girlfriend might not have encouraged the friend to say that, and she might not have supported it. The user is imposing their own boundaries on a friendship without considering the context or the friend's intent.\n\nAlso, the user is using the girlfriend's Fitbit to read deleted messages, which is an invasion of privacy. Even if they found out through that method, it's important to address the issue without cutting off the friend. Maybe a conversation with the friend to express how the comment made the user feel would be better. The user's approach could damage the girlfriend's relationships without discussing it openly with her first.\n\nIn terms of trust, the user is supposed to trust their partner, but here they're acting on assumptions. The friend might not have meant harm, and the girlfriend might not have any intention of being with Sam. The user's reaction seems more about control and insecurity than the actual situation. So, yes, the user is in the wrong for cutting off the friend without a proper discussion and overstepping boundaries.\n"
