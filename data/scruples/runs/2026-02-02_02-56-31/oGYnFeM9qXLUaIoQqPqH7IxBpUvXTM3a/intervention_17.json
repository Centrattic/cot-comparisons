  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because she called a co-worker \"boyfriend\". Hmm.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has known this friend for three years, and the guy in question, Sam, has been a co-worker for three years. The user was okay with the friend's interaction with Sam before. Then there's this incident where the friend refers to Sam as her \"boyfriend\". The user found out through some deleted messages (which the girlfriend might have hidden, but he discovered via her Fitbit). The user then decides the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship and wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with her.\n\nSo, key points: The friend made a joke about another co-worker being her \"boyfriend\". The user is upset because this could imply that the friend is being disrespectful to his relationship. But is cutting off the friendship over a joke too harsh? The user also mentions that they've been on and off for four years and live together now. Maybe trust issues are involved here.\n\nThe user's actions: He used the Fitbit to find out about deleted messages. Even though the girlfriend deleted the messages, he found out through her Fitbit. He confronted her and then decided to end the friendship. The friend didn't directly insult the user, just made a joke about Sam. The user's reaction seems extreme because the friend didn't directly do anything to him, just a joke with his girlfriend. Also, the user is cutting off the friend based on a single message. Is that fair?\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the friend wasn't being malicious, just making a joke. The user's action could hurt the girlfriend because she's been friends with this person for years. The user might be overreacting. Also, the fact that he's been checking her phone (even with the Fitbit) might indicate a lack of trust. So maybe he's in the wrong because he's cutting off the friend over a minor issue and using invasive methods to find out what's going on. But he's standing up for his relationship, which is understandable. However, the approach seems extreme. So maybe answer A: yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
