  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the guy is upset because his girlfriend's friend referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend\" and he's cutting off the friendship. \n\nFirst, the guy and his girlfriend have been on and off for four years and have been living together for three months. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (Sam) for three years. The guy was okay with the friend waving at Sam since she mentioned Sam doesn't talk to anyone else. Then, through some Fitbit messages, he found out that the friend called Sam her \"boyfriend,\" which made him cut off the friendship.\n\nSo, the key points here: The friend called another guy the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author (the guy) finds disrespectful. He's saying that even though the girlfriend ignored the message, he still doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nThe author believes that the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship. But is it fair to cut off a friend over a joke? The friend might have been just joking around, which is common in workplaces. The girlfriend had a three-year friendship with this person, so cutting it off because of one comment seems harsh. Also, the guy used the Fitbit data to check deleted messages, which might indicate some level of control or paranoia. The girlfriend might not have done anything wrong by not addressing the friend's comment, especially if she thought it was a harmless joke. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's feelings are valid\u2014he might feel disrespected. But cutting off the friend entirely without discussing it with the girlfriend first could be seen as overreacting. The friend might not have intended any harm. The author is taking away the girlfriend's agency in deciding how to handle her friendship. He's making a judgment about the friend based on one message. Maybe the friend didn't mean anything by it, and the girlfriend is okay with it. The guy's actions could be seen as controlling, especially since he's using surveillance (Fitbit) to monitor her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy might be in the wrong by cutting off the friend over a minor issue and not allowing his girlfriend to handle the situation herself. The friend's comment might not be as serious as he thinks, and cutting off a long-term friendship isn't proportional to the offense.\n"
