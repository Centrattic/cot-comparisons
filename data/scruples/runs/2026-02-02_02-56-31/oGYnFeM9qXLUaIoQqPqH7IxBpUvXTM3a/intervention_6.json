  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend refers to a male coworker as her \"boyfriend,\" which the user takes issue with. The user found out through deleted messages (via Fitbit) and now wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with the friend.\n\nThe user's main points: They don't trust joking about \"work husbands\" and believe the friend disrespects their relationship. They're cutting off the friend because of this one comment. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it, which the user sees as her fault.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The friend made a joke, and the user is reacting strongly by ending the friendship. Is that over the top? The girlfriend had a three-year friendship, and the user is cutting it off based on one message. Also, the user used the Fitbit to find out about the messages, which might be a privacy issue. But the main question is about the friend's comment.\n\nThe user's perspective is that the friend doesn't respect the relationship. However, \"boyfriend\" in a work context could be a term of endearment or a joke. The friend might not have intended any harm. The girlfriend didn't respond to the comment, which the user is upset about. But maybe she didn't see it as a big deal.\n\nIs the user overreacting? If the friend's comment was a one-time joke, cutting off a three-year friendship seems harsh. The user's trust in the relationship is important, but the response should be proportional. The user might feel insecure, but the action taken is extreme. The girlfriend's handling of the situation (deleting messages) is problematic, but the user's retaliation is also a problem. \n\nSo, the user is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, which is reasonable in a relationship, but the punishment (ending the friendship) might be disproportionate. The friend might not have intended disrespect, and the user isn't giving the friend a chance to explain. Therefore, the user could be in the wrong by overreacting and cutting off the friend without addressing the issue directly. They should have talked to the friend first, not the girlfriend. So, the answer is A, the user is the asshole.\n"
