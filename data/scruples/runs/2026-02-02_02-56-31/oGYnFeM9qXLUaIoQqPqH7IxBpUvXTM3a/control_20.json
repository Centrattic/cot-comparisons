She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's girlfriend being friends with a coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, is described as not talking to many people but interacting with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this until he found out that the friend called Sam the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The author then decided the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with her anymore because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The main issue is the author cutting off the friend due to a joke about the coworker being the \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through messages that were deleted but discovered via Fitbit. The girlfriend didn't know the author knew, and she claims she ignored the message. The author believes the friend disrespected him and the couple by making that joke.\n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. In many relationships, partners might feel jealous if a friend makes jokes about their partner's potential romantic connections. But is it reasonable to end a friendship over a single joke? The friend might have intended it as a joke, not a serious accusation. The girlfriend tried to move past it, which suggests she didn't take it seriously either. The author is acting on a deleted message, which might not have been a big deal if the girlfriend didn't respond. However, the author's reaction seems extreme\u2014cutting off a three-year friendship over a joke. \n\nAlso, the author's method of finding out (using Fitbit to see deleted messages) might imply some level of mistrust. Even though the girlfriend deleted messages, the author's approach to confronting her might be based on a lack of communication. The author's stance is that he doesn't accept work husbands or boyfriends, but that's his personal boundary. However, the friend's comment was about someone else, not the author himself. So maybe the author is overstepping by punishing the friend for a joke about another coworker.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action is a personal choice, but whether it's justified is debatable. The friend might have acted inappropriately, but cutting off the friendship entirely for a single joke seems harsh. The girlfriend's reaction to ignore the message shows she didn't take it seriously. The author's jealousy might be leading him to overreact. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not allowing the friendship to continue based on a minor issue. But it's a nuanced situation. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because cutting off a friend over a joke without discussing it with the girlfriend first and without considering context might be excessive. The author could have addressed the issue more constructively, like talking to the friend about the joke rather than ending the friendship abruptly.\n"
