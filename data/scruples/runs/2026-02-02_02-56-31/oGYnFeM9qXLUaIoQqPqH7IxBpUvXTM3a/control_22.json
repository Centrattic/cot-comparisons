She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called a male coworker \"her boyfriend.\" The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the author's reaction to the friend referring to a coworker as \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker (Sam) for over three years, and the author was initially okay with the friendship. Now, the friend refers to another coworker (Sam?) as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which the author finds disrespectful and decides to end the friendship.\n\nWait, the user mentioned Sam doesn't talk to anyone at work except the girlfriend. Then the friend refers to Sam as \"your boyfriend\"? Maybe that's the confusion here. The author's girlfriend didn't correct the friend, but the author is upset that the friend didn't respect the author's relationship.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that the friend shouldn't call another coworker \"boyfriend,\" even if it's a joke or a term of endearment in a work context. The author is not okay with \"work husband\" jokes and wants the friendship to end because the friend didn't respect their relationship.\n\nBut is the author overreacting? The friend might have been using a term that's common in workplaces, like a \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend,\" which is a playful way to describe a close colleague, not a romantic partner. The author's girlfriend didn't correct the friend, which could mean she's okay with that term, or maybe she didn't want to cause a scene. But the author is now cutting off the friend because of a single message. Is that a fair reaction?\n\nAlso, there's the context of the author and girlfriend checking each other's phones. The author found out the message through the Fitbit, which the girlfriend didn't know. This adds a layer of privacy concerns. However, the user says not to focus on the phone-checking part unless it's the main issue. The main issue is the author ending the friendship because of the term \"boyfriend\" used by the friend.\n\nIs it reasonable to end a friendship over that? It depends on the relationship's norms. If the author has clear boundaries about how the girlfriend refers to other people, and the friend crossed that by using the term, maybe. But in many workplaces, people use such terms playfully. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or being overly possessive. The girlfriend might have been in the middle, not correcting the friend, but the author is taking it a step further by cutting off the friend entirely, which could be seen as too harsh.\n\nAlso, the author is assuming the friend didn't respect them as a couple, but the friend might not have intended any disrespect. The message was about a coworker being late, not about the relationship. The term \"boyfriend\" might have been used in a different context. Without more context, it's hard to say, but the author is making a judgment based on one message.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong: If the friend's use of the term was innocent and the author is being overly controlling, then yes, the author is in the wrong. However, if the author has communicated their boundaries clearly and the friend disregarded them, then maybe not. But the scenario suggests that the author is reacting to a single instance without knowing the full context of how the term was used or the friend's intent. Ending a friendship over a miscommunication or a joke could be seen as excessive. The girlfriend's friend might not have intended to disrespect the author, and cutting her off might be an overreaction. Therefore, the author's action could be considered the wrong choice here.\n"
