  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend who called a coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for over three years. The user is upset because the friend made a joke referring to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" The user found out through deleted messages (via Fitbit) and now wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with her.\n\nSo, is the user justified? Well, calling someone a \"work husband\" or \"boyfriend\" is common in workplaces as a joke. The friend might not have intended anything malicious. The user is cutting off the friend for a single comment, which could be seen as overly harsh. Also, the user is using surveillance (checking Fitbit) to find out about the messages, which raises privacy issues. The girlfriend might feel betrayed if she didn't know her Fitbit was being monitored. \n\nThe user's approach to ending the friendship without considering the context of the joke or the long-standing friendship might be too extreme. The girlfriend's friend might not have realized the comment was offensive, so the user could have discussed it more calmly instead of immediately cutting ties. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might feel insecure, especially since they've had a long on-and-off relationship. But cutting off a friend over a joke seems like a disproportionate response. The user should probably talk to the friend first, express their feelings, and see if the friend can be more respectful, rather than ending the friendship abruptly. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely A (the user is the asshole) because the reaction is too harsh and based on surveillance without addressing the issue more constructively.\n"
