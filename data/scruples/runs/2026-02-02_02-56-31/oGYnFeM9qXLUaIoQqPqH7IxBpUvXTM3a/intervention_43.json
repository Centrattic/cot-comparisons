  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user is okay with the friend because the coworker only interacts with her. But when the user finds out that the friend jokingly refers to another guy as the girlfriend's boyfriend, he decides the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship, so he wants the girlfriend to end the friendship.\n\nNow, considering the points. Trust is a big issue here. The user trusted the girlfriend's assurance that the coworker wasn't a problem. Then he found out the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" about someone else. The user cut off the friend because of that. \n\nIs it reasonable to end a friendship over a joke? Jokes about work relationships are common, like \"work wife\" or \"work husband.\" The friend might have been joking, not meaning any harm. The user seems to take it seriously, but maybe overreacting. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message and moved on, which shows she didn't take it seriously either.\n\nAlso, the user's method of finding out was through checking her Fitbit, which might imply some level of surveillance. The context of their phone checking could affect trust. But the main issue is the reaction to the friend's comment.\n\nThe user is asking if he's wrong. In relationships, communication is key. Instead of cutting off the friend abruptly, maybe discussing it with the girlfriend and finding a mutual understanding would be better. Ending a long-term friendship over a joke might be harsh. The user's action could be seen as controlling or not giving the friend the benefit of the doubt. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A\u2014Yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
