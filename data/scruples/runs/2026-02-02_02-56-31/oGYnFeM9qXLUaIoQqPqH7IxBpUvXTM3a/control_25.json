She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been friends for three years. The friend, Sam, has a reputation at work for not talking to many people, but he does interact with the girlfriend. The author was okay with this initially because he trusted her. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, which he found out about through her Fitbit. The deleted message included the friend referring to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then decided the girlfriend shouldn't be friends with the friend anymore because the friend didn't respect him as a partner.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about trust, boundaries, and overreaction. The author is cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke or comment. Even though the girlfriend didn't engage with the message, the author is taking a stand against any reference to a \"boyfriend\" from the friend. The friend might have been joking, as sometimes people use terms like \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" casually. The author's reaction seems extreme because it's cutting off a friend based on one instance. Also, the author is using the girlfriend's deleted messages as a reason to distrust her, which could be problematic. The girlfriend might feel that her friend is being unfairly targeted, especially if the term was meant as a joke. The author's approach could be seen as controlling, especially since he's using the Fitbit to monitor her without her knowledge. While the friend's comment might be inappropriate, the author's response of ending the friendship entirely might be too harsh. There's also the aspect of the author's own actions, like checking her phone and using the Fitbit, which could be seen as invasive. So, considering all this, the author might be the asshole because he's overreacting and not giving the friend a chance to clarify or apologize. The relationship issues might stem from his jealousy rather than the friend's actions. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
