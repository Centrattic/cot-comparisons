  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for cutting off their girlfriend's friend who called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend had a history of deleting messages, which the user found out through her Fitbit. The friend made a joke about Sam being her boyfriend, which the user took as a serious disrespect.\n\nFirst, the user's jealousy is understandable. They might feel that the friend is being disrespectful by referring to someone else as the girlfriend's boyfriend. However, the way they're handling it might be an overreaction. The friend called Sam the girlfriend's \"boyfriend\" as a joke, which could be a common workplace term, not a serious claim. The user is cutting off the friend based on a single message, which might not be justified. Also, using the girlfriend's deleted messages (even via Fitbit) to confront her could be seen as invasive, but the main issue here is the response to the friend. The user's approach of ending the friendship over a joke might be too harsh. The girlfriend's friend didn't intend harm, and cutting her off entirely might not be the best solution. The user should have maybe talked to the friend first to address the joke rather than ending the friendship. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the user is in the wrong) because they overreacted and didn't handle it appropriately.\n"
