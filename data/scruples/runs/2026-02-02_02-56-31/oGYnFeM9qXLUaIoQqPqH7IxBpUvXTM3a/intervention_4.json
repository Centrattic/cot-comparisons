  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend after the friend called a coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the boyfriend found out the friend referred to another coworker as \"boyfriend\" in a message. He then cuts off the friendship because he doesn't want to be disrespected. The girlfriend had a history of deleting messages, which he discovered through her Fitbit, and confronted her about it.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the boyfriend overreacted. The friend's comment is a bit of a joke, maybe even harmless. But the boyfriend took it as a serious disrespect towards their relationship. On the other hand, the fact that the girlfriend had been deleting messages and hiding things might contribute to his distrust. \n\nHowever, ending a friendship over a single joke might be too harsh, especially if the friend didn't mean it maliciously. The girlfriend might have been the one to delete messages, but the boyfriend's approach of cutting off the friend entirely seems extreme. Communication between the couple about boundaries before taking such a drastic step could have been better. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's reaction is based on his feelings of being disrespected, but the friend's intent isn't clear. The decision to end the friendship without giving the friend a chance to address it could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the answer leans towards him being in the wrong.\n"
