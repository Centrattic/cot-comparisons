  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if he's in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and this friend have been friends for over three years. The co-worker (Sam) is described as not really interacting with others at work except waving at the girlfriend. The user was okay with this initially, trusting the girlfriend. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, and through the Fitbit, the user found out that the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The user then told his girlfriend to stop being friends with this person because they don't respect him or the relationship.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? Well, the main issue is the friend calling someone a \"boyfriend.\" The user is upset about that term being used, which he sees as disrespectful. But does that justify cutting off the friend? The girlfriend had already addressed it by ignoring the message, and the user is now taking it further without discussing it with her first. The friend might have just been joking or using a term that's common in their workplace. The user is acting on a single message, which could be taken out of context. Also, the user is using the girlfriend's phone deletion as a reason, which might indicate a lack of trust. While it's understandable to feel jealous or concerned, cutting off a friend over a casual reference might be too harsh. The user should probably have a conversation with his girlfriend and the friend first to understand the context better instead of immediately cutting ties. The girlfriend's long-term friendship is at stake here, and the user's reaction seems a bit extreme given the situation. So, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's overreacting and not considering the nuances of the situation.\n"
