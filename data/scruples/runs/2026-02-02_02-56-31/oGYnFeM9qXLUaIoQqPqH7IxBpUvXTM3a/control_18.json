She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over calling a co-worker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for over 3 years. The guy (Sam) is a co-worker who's been there for 3+ years, and he's the only one Sam interacts with. The author was okay with this initially. Then, the girlfriend deleted some messages. The key message was when her friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend claims she ignored the message, but the author found out via the Fitbit messages and now wants to end the friendship because the friend doesn't respect him and the relationship.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that even if it's a joke, calling someone else a \"boyfriend\" is not acceptable. He believes the friend shouldn't have made that joke, and the girlfriend should have addressed it. So he's cutting off the friend.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main points are: \n\n1. The friend's comment was a joke, possibly a work-related one. People sometimes use terms like \"work husband\" or \"boyfriend\" in a joking manner, especially in professional settings. The girlfriend didn't respond to the message, which might indicate she didn't take it seriously.\n\n2. The author is cutting off a 3-year friendship based on a single joke. That seems harsh. The friend might not have intended to disrespect the author, and the girlfriend didn't confront her about it, suggesting she didn't take it as a big issue.\n\n3. The author is using the fact that the friend said \"boyfriend\" as a reason to end the friendship. However, without the girlfriend being part of the decision, the author is making a unilateral choice based on something that might be a light-hearted comment.\n\n4. The author also mentions that they go through each other's phones, which can be a red flag in a relationship. The girlfriend deleting messages might be a privacy issue, but the author is using that as leverage to find out the friend's comment. The method of finding out through the Fitbit might be manipulative, which complicates the situation.\n\nIn terms of relationship boundaries, the author might have a right to feel uncomfortable, but cutting off a friend over a joke is a significant step. The friend might not have intended harm, and the author is making a judgment without addressing the issue with the friend first. The girlfriend didn't confront her friend, which could imply that she didn't see it as a problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is making a drastic decision (ending a friendship) over a joke that might not have been meant as an insult. The friend's comment alone doesn't necessarily justify ending the friendship, especially without communication. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not addressing the issue constructively.\n"
