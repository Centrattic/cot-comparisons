She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called someone else her \"boyfriend.\" The setup is that the girlfriend has a friend for three years who only interacts with her a little at work. The author found out that the friend referred to a co-worker as her \"boyfriend,\" and now he wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with that person.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main issue is the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend about it, and the author found out through messages she deleted. The author then cut off the friendship because he feels disrespected.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is it reasonable for the author to be upset about the term \"boyfriend\" being used? Does the friend's comment justify cutting off a three-year friendship? Should the girlfriend have addressed it herself first?\n\nThe friend called someone else the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" which might be a work-related joke or a nickname. The author is taking it seriously because he sees it as disrespect. But maybe the friend didn't mean anything by it. The girlfriend didn't confront the friend, so maybe she didn't see it as a big deal. The author is now using that as a reason to end the friendship.\n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, it's his choice to set boundaries in the relationship. He might feel that any reference to another man as a boyfriend is a line he doesn't want crossed. However, cutting off a friend based on a single joke or nickname could be seen as extreme. Also, the girlfriend didn't act on it, so maybe she didn't see it as a problem. The author is stepping in without discussing it with her, which might be controlling.\n\nAnother angle: The author used the Fitbit to read messages she deleted. That's a privacy issue. Even though the girlfriend lied about the messages, using her Fitbit data to check could be seen as violating her privacy. That might affect the judgment here because it shows he's been snooping.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might be in the wrong because cutting off a friend over a minor joke without addressing it with his girlfriend first and using sneaky methods to find out about the messages could make him the asshole. Alternatively, if he genuinely feels disrespected, maybe he's not. But the main issue is the drastic action of cutting off the friend without considering that the friend might not have intended anything malicious and without the girlfriend taking initiative.\n"
