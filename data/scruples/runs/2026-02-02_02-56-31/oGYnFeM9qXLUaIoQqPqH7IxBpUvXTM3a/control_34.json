She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend over calling a co-worker \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend has been friends with this girl for three years, and the friend referred to another co-worker, Sam, as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out via deleted messages that the friend made this comment, leading him to cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, the author's reaction: he's upset because the friend called Sam her boyfriend. He doesn't trust the friend's intentions and believes she disrespects him and their relationship. He's also mentioned that he and his girlfriend check each other's phones, which adds a layer of privacy issues. The girlfriend might be hiding things, and the author feels justified in not trusting the friend.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, cutting off a friend over a single joke might be a harsh reaction. The friend might have been joking, as the user acknowledges that sometimes people use terms like \"work husband\" playfully. The author didn't give the friend a chance to explain or apologize; he just cut her off. That could be seen as overreacting. Also, the author is using the girlfriend's past of hiding messages as a reason to distrust the friend, which might not be fair. The girlfriend's actions (deleting messages) are separate from the friend's comment. The author is conflating the two, which could be a mistake.\n\nMoreover, the author's approach to handling the situation\u2014by cutting off the friend without discussion\u2014might not address the underlying trust issues in the relationship. Instead of confronting the friend, he's taking a drastic step that could hurt the girlfriend, who has a long-standing friendship. This could lead to more conflict in the relationship if the girlfriend feels he's being controlling or not trusting her judgment about her friends.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns about being disrespected. If the friend's comment was meant to be mocking or disrespectful, then the author's reaction might stem from a place of wanting to protect the relationship. However, the method of cutting off the friend without understanding the context or giving her a chance to clarify might be problematic.\n\nIn terms of trust, the girlfriend's deletion of messages is an issue, but the author's decision to use the Fitbit to find out might not be the healthiest approach. The relationship dynamic here is complex, and the author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially if he's making unilateral decisions about her friendships based on a single message.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's reaction seems a bit extreme. The friend's comment might have been innocent, and cutting off the friendship without discussion is a harsh move. The author is in the wrong for not addressing the issue more constructively with both his girlfriend and the friend, rather than making a snap decision based on a single incident.\n"
