  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves trust issues, phone privacy, and how the user found out about the messages through the girlfriend's Fitbit.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The user originally was okay with their interaction, as the coworker (Sam) didn't really talk to anyone else. But now, the friend referred to another coworker as \"boyfriend,\" which the user finds unacceptable. The user confronted the girlfriend after discovering the deleted messages via her Fitbit. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on, which the user believes.\n\nNow, the core issue is whether cutting off a friend over a single, possibly offhand comment is justified. The user's stance is that the friend doesn't respect the relationship and that the girlfriend should have addressed it. However, friends often joke around or use terms like \"work husband\" without malice. The user's reaction seems extreme\u2014ending a three-year friendship over a joke, especially when the girlfriend didn't engage with it. \n\nAdditionally, the user's method of discovering the message involved using the girlfriend's Fitbit without her knowledge, which might be a privacy violation. Even if the user is in a relationship where they both check each other's phones, using the Fitbit to track deleted messages could be seen as deceptive. This might have influenced the user's decision unfairly.\n\nThe user's trust in the girlfriend is there, but their response of cutting off the friend entirely might be too harsh. The girlfriend didn't participate in the joke and tried to move past it. The friend might not have intended any disrespect. The user is enforcing a rule that friends shouldn't call others \"boyfriend,\" but that's a personal boundary that might not be everyone's. It's important in a relationship to discuss boundaries respectfully rather than making unilateral decisions that end friendships.\n\nAlso, the user's method of confrontation might have been based on a misunderstanding or lack of context. Without knowing the full conversation or the friend's intent, cutting off the friend could be seen as overreacting. Relationships require communication and mutual respect, so the user should have discussed their feelings with the girlfriend and maybe the friend instead of immediately ending the friendship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user has valid concerns about how their relationship is perceived, their reaction of cutting off the friend without considering the context and intent might be too harsh. The method of discovering the message also raises privacy issues. So, the answer is likely that they are in the wrong.\n"
