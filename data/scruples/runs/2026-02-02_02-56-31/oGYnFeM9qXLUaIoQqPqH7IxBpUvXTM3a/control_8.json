She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend after she referred to another co-worker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend have been working together for three years. The author was initially okay with their friendship because the co-worker (Sam) doesn't talk much to others. The friend called Sam the girl's \"boyfriend\" in a message, which the girlfriend deleted. The author found out through the Fitbit and confronted her. He then told her he doesn't want her to be friends with the friend anymore because the friend doesn't respect their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, the girlfriend deleting messages, and the author ending the friendship. \n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. In relationships, trust and communication are important. However, the way the author handled this might be problematic. The friend might have been joking or using the term in a non-serious way, which is common in workplaces. The author's reaction is quite drastic\u2014cutting off the friend entirely. That seems harsh, especially since the friend's action alone might not warrant ending a three-year friendship. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend didn't think it was an issue and dismissed the message, moving on. The author's decision to end the friendship without discussing it with her or understanding the context better could be seen as overreacting. She might have a right to her own friendships unless there's a pattern of disrespect beyond this one instance. \n\nAdditionally, the author used the Fitbit data to find out about the deleted messages. While that shows he was suspicious, it's not the main issue here. The main issue is his response to the situation. Ending a friendship over a single joke, especially without the girlfriend's input, might not be justified. \n\nSo, the author might be right in feeling upset about the term being used, but the way he's handling it could be too extreme. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because cutting off the friend over a single instance of a joke term isn't proportionate. However, some might argue that it's his right to set boundaries in the relationship. But given the circumstances, the extreme action makes the author the asshole.\n"
