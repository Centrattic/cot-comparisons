She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend (gf) has a friend who's been calling another co-worker her \"boyfriend,\" and the author is upset about that. The main question is whether the author is being unreasonable by cutting off the friendship because of that.\n\nFirst, the friend in question has been working with the gf for over three years and seems to have a very limited social circle at work, only interacting with the gf. The author was okay with that initially because he trusted the gf when she said the co-worker (Sam) doesn't talk to others. Then, the author found out that the friend called Sam the \"boyfriend\" and took it as a slight, leading him to cut off the friendship.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend's comment was joking around, and the gf actually ignored the message. The author's reaction is based on the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend,\" which he finds disrespectful. But is that a valid reason? The term \"work husband\" or \"work boyfriend\" is often used humorously among friends without romantic implications. If the friend intended it as a joke and the gf didn't take offense, maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nAlso, the author used the Fitbit messages to confront the gf. Even though the friend's comment was inappropriate in his eyes, using a technical trick to uncover deleted messages might make the author come off as controlling or distrustful. The way he's handling the situation could be seen as invasive. Moreover, cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke, even if it's a term he dislikes, might be too harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author does point out that he's not okay with such terms, which is his right. If the friend repeatedly used that term or targeted the relationship, it might be different, but it seems like a one-time joke. The gf herself didn't take offense and moved on. The author's reaction might be based more on insecurity or jealousy than the actual severity of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions\u2014cutting off the friend over a single joke and using surveillance to find out what was said\u2014might make him the asshole here. The friend's comment, while possibly inconsiderate, doesn't seem to warrant such a strong reaction, especially when the gf didn't find it offensive. The author's methods of checking messages and Fitbit data also contribute to a controlling image, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n"
