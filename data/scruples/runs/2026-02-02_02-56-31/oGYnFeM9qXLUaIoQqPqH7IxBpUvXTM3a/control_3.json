She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, and he's upset that her friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" He found out because of deleted messages and her Fitbit. Now he wants her to stop being friends with that person.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker (Sam) is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with her. The author was okay with this initially. Then there's the issue of the friend referring to another guy as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend.\" The girlfriend didn't respond to that message, but the author found out through deleted messages on her Fitbit. He then cut off her friendship with the friend because he felt disrespected.\n\nSo, the main question is whether cutting off the friendship was justified. The author is making a judgment based on a single instance where the friend used the term \"boyfriend\" for another coworker. But the friend might have been joking or using a common workplace term. Also, the girlfriend didn't engage with the comment, which suggests she might not have supported it.\n\nThe author's actions here are a bit controlling. He's using the discovery of deleted messages (which he found out through a Fitbit) to make a big decision about ending a three-year friendship. Even if he's insecure, reacting this strongly over a single joke could be seen as overreacting. Trust is important in a relationship, and if he's checking her phone and Fitbit, that's a red flag. His approach might be more about his own jealousy than the friend's actual behavior.\n\nAlso, the friend's comment might not have been malicious. Workplace relationships can have playful terms, but it's possible the friend was unaware of the author's feelings. The girlfriend should probably have addressed it, but cutting off a friend for one joke isn't necessarily fair. The author hasn't given the friend a chance to explain or apologize. Instead, he's using this as a reason to end the friendship, which could be seen as unfair and controlling.\n\nIn terms of the girlfriend, she did delete messages, which is a privacy issue. However, the author's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) shows he's been intrusive. The situation is a mix of trust issues, control, and communication breakdown. The author's reaction is probably not justified because one joke, even if it's a boundary issue, doesn't warrant ending a long-term friendship without discussion. He should have talked to the friend first or addressed it with his girlfriend rather than cutting her off immediately.\n"
