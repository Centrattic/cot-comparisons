  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend over a joke. The situation involves the friend calling a co-worker her \"boyfriend.\" The user found out through deleted messages that the friend made this joke, and now they don't want their girlfriend to be friends with her anymore.\n\nFirst, the user's main point is about respecting the relationship. They feel that the friend is disrespecting them by referring to someone else as the boyfriend. But is that a valid reason to end a friendship? The friend might not have realized the user's feelings about it. The girlfriend has been friends with her for three years, so maybe there's a long history.\n\nThe user found out indirectly through the Fitbit messages, which raises some issues. The girlfriend deleted messages, which could be a red flag about privacy and trust. The user used the Fitbit to read deleted messages, which might be considered invasive. Even if the user believes they're justified, using a third-party device to read deleted messages could be seen as a breach of privacy.\n\nThen there's the reaction. The user cut off the friend without giving her a chance to explain or apologize. The friend might have made a harmless joke, not intending to disrespect the relationship. The user's response is quite severe\u2014ending a three-year friendship over one joke. Maybe the user should have discussed it with the girlfriend first, let her address it with the friend, and not taken matters into their own hands.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned that the girlfriend has a co-worker (Sam) who only interacts with her, which the user was okay with. But when the friend made a joke about another co-worker being the boyfriend, the user took offense. It's possible that the user is being inconsistent, allowing one situation but not another. That could hurt the girlfriend, making her feel like she's being controlled or that her friendships are under scrutiny.\n\nThe user's approach might be coming from a place of jealousy or insecurity, which is common in relationships. However, cutting off a friend without a proper conversation and based on a joke might be overreacting. Healthy communication is important. The user should have discussed their feelings with the girlfriend first, let her decide how to handle the situation with her friend, and maybe given the friend a chance to apologize.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. The user is using the Fitbit to monitor messages, which might erode trust in the relationship. The girlfriend might feel that the user doesn't trust her, leading to more conflict. It's a cycle where lack of trust leads to invasive actions, which then confirm the user's fears.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's feelings are valid regarding the joke about the boyfriend, their method of handling it is problematic. Cutting off the friend without a chance to explain and using invasive methods to discover the message might make them the asshole in this situation. The answer is likely A (Yes, they're in the wrong) because the approach was too harsh and based on privacy invasion.\n"
