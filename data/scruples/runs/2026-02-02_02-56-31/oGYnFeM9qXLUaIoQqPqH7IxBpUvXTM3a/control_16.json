She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for cutting off his girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" The situation involves some jealousy and control over the friend's relationships.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The author is upset because the coworker, Sam, is described as someone who doesn't talk to many people at work but interacts with the girlfriend. The author initially accepted this, trusting the girlfriend's assurance. \n\nThen there's the part about the Fitbit. The girlfriend deleted messages, but the Fitbit messages linger. The author uses this to find out that the friend called the coworker \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells the girlfriend he doesn't want her to be friends with the coworker anymore because they don't respect the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reaction to a single instance of a nickname. The friend used \"boyfriend\" in a message, which the girlfriend had already addressed by ignoring it. The author is cutting off the friend over this, which seems extreme. The friend might have been joking or using a term in a casual way, but the author is taking it seriously. \n\nAlso, the author is acting without discussing it with the girlfriend. He's making a unilateral decision to end the friendship based on one message. Healthy relationships involve communication and mutual respect. By cutting off the friend without giving the girlfriend a chance to address it with her friend herself, the author is imposing his own standards without considering her perspective. \n\nMoreover, the author is using the Fitbit as a way to check deleted messages, which indicates a lack of trust. Even though the girlfriend does delete messages, using the Fitbit to catch her isn't a healthy approach. The author's actions suggest controlling behavior, which can be a red flag in relationships. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues directly with the person involved rather than cutting someone off over a minor issue. The author's reaction seems more about controlling his girlfriend's social interactions rather than respecting her autonomy. The friend probably didn't mean any harm, and the author's response is overly harsh. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is acting out of jealousy and a lack of trust, which are his own issues. He's not the one in the wrong for the friend's comment, but his response is problematic. Therefore, he is the asshole here.\n"
