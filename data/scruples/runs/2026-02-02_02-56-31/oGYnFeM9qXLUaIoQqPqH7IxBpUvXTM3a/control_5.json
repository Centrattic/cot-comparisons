She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the guy is upset because his girlfriend's friend called another co-worker her \"boyfriend,\" leading him to cut off the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been on and off for four years but has been living together for three months. The girlfriend has been friends with the co-worker (the \"girl\") for over three years. The guy was okay with the friend waving and minimal interaction with the guy's girlfriend. However, when the friend refers to another co-worker (Sam) as the girlfriend's \"boyfriend,\" the guy reacts by ending the friendship.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the guy) is the asshole (ITA). The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics here. The guy found out through the girlfriend's Fitbit that the friend had called Sam her boyfriend. The girlfriend claims the friend was joking or using a \"work husband\" term. The guy is not okay with either and wants the friendship cut off because the friend doesn't respect him as the boyfriend.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The guy's reaction seems to be based on feeling disrespected. However, is it right to end a friendship over a joke? The friend might not have intended to cause harm. The girlfriend's friend has a history of joking about relationships, which is common in workplaces. The guy is imposing his discomfort onto the girlfriend's friendship, which might not be fair. The girlfriend's friend might not realize the term could be offensive, but if she's been told before and continues, that's different. But the guy is not the one in the friendship with the friend; the girlfriend is. So maybe the guy should have discussed this with his girlfriend first rather than cutting off the friend himself.\n\nAlso, the guy's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) might be a factor, but the user says not to focus on the phone checking part. The main issue is the response to the \"boyfriend\" comment. The guy is acting unilaterally without considering the friend's intent or the girlfriend's feelings about the friendship. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. Cutting off a friend based on a joke without discussion might be overreacting. The guy's stance is about respect, but he's also being controlling without understanding the context. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's overreacting and not allowing for open communication, assuming the friend's intent without a conversation, and acting unilaterally.\n"
