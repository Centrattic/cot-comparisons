She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been on and off for four years and now live together. The girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years. The coworker, Sam, only interacts with her, and the author was okay with that. Then, the friend called another coworker \"her boyfriend,\" leading the author to end the friendship.\n\nThe author found out through deleted messages (detected via Fitbit) that the friend made this comment. The girlfriend admitted she ignored the message and moved on. The author now wants the girlfriend to stop being friends with her, citing lack of respect.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: \n\n1. **Jealousy over a \"work boyfriend\" reference**: The friend's statement could be seen as a joke, but the author takes it seriously. Friends might use such terms playfully without romantic intent.\n\n2. **Author's reaction**: Ending the friendship seems harsh. The friend didn't act on the comment, just made a joke. The author didn't communicate this boundary to the friend first.\n\n3. **Trust and communication**: The couple's history of checking phones and deleting messages points to underlying trust issues. The author used circumstantial evidence (Fitbit) to confront the girlfriend, which might indicate control.\n\n4. **Respect for the girlfriend's friendships**: Cutting off a longtime friend over a minor, possibly innocent comment might be overreacting. The girlfriend should have the right to her friendships unless there's actual betrayal.\n\n5. **Author's justification**: The author believes the friend disrespected him by the joke. However, the friend didn't address the author directly or act on the comment.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's reaction seems excessive. The friend's comment was likely a joke, and cutting off the friendship without addressing it directly with the friend (and understanding context) shows a lack of communication. The author's actions could be seen as controlling, especially given the phone-checking behavior. The girlfriend's right to maintain friendships and the friend's lack of malicious intent suggest the author is overstepping. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
