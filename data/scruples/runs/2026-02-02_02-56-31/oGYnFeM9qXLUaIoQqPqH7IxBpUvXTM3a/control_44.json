She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend called another coworker \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has been friends with this coworker for three years, and the author was okay with their interaction initially. The main issue arises when the friend refers to a male coworker (Sam) as her \"boyfriend.\" The author found out through deleted messages (which he discovered via the Fitbit) and decided to end the friendship, claiming the friend doesn't respect him or their relationship.\n\nNow, considering relationships and boundaries. Using terms like \"boyfriend\" for a co-worker might be a joke or a term of endearment, but it's not necessarily malicious. The author's response seems harsh\u2014cutting off a friend just for a nickname could be seen as overreacting, especially since the girlfriend didn't reciprocate the term and the friend might not have intended harm. \n\nTrust is a big factor here. The author had been trusting the girlfriend until now, and this incident triggered jealousy. However, cutting off a friend based on one joke-like message might be too extreme. The author's method of discovering the messages through the Fitbit also raises questions about privacy and trust. Even if the girlfriend deleted messages, using a third-party device to monitor them could be invasive.\n\nAlso, the author's insistence that such terms are never okay might be unrealistic. Many workplaces have playful banter, and unless there's a clear boundary violation or inappropriate behavior, this alone might not justify ending a friendship. The author's approach could strain the relationship with the girlfriend, especially if she feels her friendship was unjustly terminated without her direct involvement in the joke.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the action taken might be disproportionate. The key points are the severity of the response versus the nature of the offense and the method of uncovering the messages. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting and not handling the situation more openly with their girlfriend instead of cutting off the friend abruptly.\n"
