She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a relationship situation involving a girlfriend and a friend. The main issue is the author cutting off the girlfriend's friend because the friend called a male coworker \"her boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend and her friend have been friends for over three years. The author was okay with the friend waving at her, as the girlfriend told him that this coworker, Sam, doesn't talk to others. The author trusted that. Then, the girlfriend deleted messages, but the author found out via her Fitbit that she had a message where the friend referred to Sam as her \"boyfriend.\" The author then tells her to stop being friends with that friend because the friend doesn't respect the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend's use of the term \"boyfriend\" for Sam, the girlfriend's response (ignoring the message), the author's reaction (cutting off the friend), and whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author is asserting his boundaries about not wanting his girlfriend to have a work husband or anything similar. The friend's comment was a joke or casual use of the term, which some people might do. The girlfriend tried to move past it, but the author is now cutting off the friend. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, in relationships, communication is key. The author is upset that the friend used the term, which he doesn't accept. However, cutting off a long-term friend over a single joke might be too harsh. The friend might not have intended any harm, and the girlfriend already addressed it by ignoring the message. The author's reaction seems impulsive and not discussing it with his girlfriend first. Also, the fact that he used the Fitbit to monitor her and then used that information to demand she tell him everything adds to the tension. \n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the author is being controlling, especially if they had previous issues with phone monitoring. The friend's comment could be innocent, and cutting her off without giving her a chance to apologize or clarify might be unnecessary. The author is taking away the girlfriend's autonomy in her friendship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to set boundaries in the relationship. If he feels that terms like \"boyfriend\" are disrespectful or imply a closeness he doesn't want, he should communicate that. But cutting off the friend entirely without discussion seems extreme. \n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, given that the friend's comment was likely a joke and the author is making a unilateral decision without considering the girlfriend's perspective or the context, he might be overstepping. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his reaction is disproportionate and controlling.\n"
