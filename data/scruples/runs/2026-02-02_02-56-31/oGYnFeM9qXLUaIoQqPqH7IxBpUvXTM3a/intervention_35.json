  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not allowing my gf (28) to be friends with co-worker(of 3+ years) anymore for calling one of their co-workers her \"boyfriend\"?\nA little background, me and my gf live together (3 Months now) but have been on and off for 4 years. She's been friends with this girl for 3+ years. My gf told me straight up that this guy (let's call him Sam from now on) Sam doesn't talk too anyone at their job (plenty of male female associates). But, since he has worked there he \"waves\" at my gf and is the only person at their job he kinda talks to. I was ok with that. I trusted her since she brought it up. \n\nI posted yesterday that we go through each other's phones. Well she deleted a few message. Most were innocent \"what are you girls wearing tomorrow?\". How I know you ask? Well she has a Fitbit and while she deletes her text on her phone her Fitbit takes longer to delete them. (this isn't the point of this post please don't focus or make your decision based off this). But I used the knowledge that she erased messages (she doesn't know her fitbit is betraying her) to let her tell me everything she deleted. Turns out that she deleted a message where her friend said something along the lines of \"your boyfriend (Sam) was late to work last night\" my gf told me that she ignored the message and moved the conversation on. I believe her because she is under the impression that I read it all (still thinks I hacked her phone when in reality she sank herself. I read one fitbit message).\n\nAfter finding this out. I said \"I don't want you to be friends with her anymore she doesn't respect me as your man and us as a couple\". I know some people joke around and sometimes have innocent \"work husband's\". I'm not ok with either. I believe my gf should had told her friend that it's not ok to call another man that and I don't think her friend had a right to joke like that. \n\nAm I the asshole for not wanting her to keep that friend anymore? \n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off their girlfriend's friend because the friend referred to another coworker as her \"boyfriend.\" \n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the friend (let's call her Jane) have been friends for three years. The user is okay with Jane waving at her and being the only coworker he talks to. But when the friend calls someone else her \"boyfriend,\" the user takes it as a serious issue. \n\nThe user found out through the girlfriend's deleted messages (which he discovered via her Fitbit) that Jane made this comment. The girlfriend claims she ignored the message and moved on. The user then tells her he doesn't want her to be friends with Jane anymore, saying she doesn't respect him and the relationship.\n\nNow, considering the situation: The friend's comment might be a joke, which is not uncommon in workplaces. The girlfriend didn't act on it, just ignored it. The user is being controlling by cutting off a long-time friend over a single joke. Also, the user's method of finding out (using the Fitbit) is a bit sneaky and manipulative. The girlfriend's actions of deleting messages might have been out of embarrassment or to avoid conflict, but the user's response is disproportionately cutting off a friend without giving her a chance to address it. \n\nTrust and communication are key here. The user should have talked to the friend first to clarify the comment instead of cutting her off. The user is acting out of jealousy or insecurity, which can be valid feelings, but the way he's handling it is problematic. The girlfriend's friend may not have intended harm, and the user's reaction is harsh without clear evidence of wrongdoing beyond a joke.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user is in the wrong for cutting off the friend over a minor issue and using manipulative tactics to get information.\n"
