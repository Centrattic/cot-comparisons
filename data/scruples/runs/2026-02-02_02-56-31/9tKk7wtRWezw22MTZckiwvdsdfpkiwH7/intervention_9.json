We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. They set up the situation: they host game nights at their house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The host is anti-gun, and they told Jim beforehand not to bring the gun into the house. Jim didn't leave it in his truck, and after the first meeting, another person told the host he had the gun on him. The host then told Jim not to come back if he's armed, leading to Jim leaving the group. The host's friends are split on whether this was fair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the host is in the wrong. The user's stance is that it's their house, their rules, and they don't want guns there. They acted after one incident, which they considered a serious issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and personal rights involved. In the U.S., the host of a private residence can set their own rules regarding firearms. Even if someone has a concealed carry permit, the host can prohibit guns on their property. So, legally, the host is within their rights to ask Jim to leave the gun in his car or not allow him in if he's carrying. \n\nThen, the moral aspect. The host made it clear before the event that guns weren't allowed, but Jim didn't follow the rule. The host acted on that violation, which is reasonable if the host is uncomfortable with guns in their home. The host isn't being unreasonable because it's a personal space, and the presence of a gun could make others feel unsafe. The fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being told not to shows a disregard for the host's boundaries, which the host has the right to enforce.\n\nThe group's mixed reactions don't change the fact that the host's decision is based on their own comfort and safety. The host also mentioned that this wasn't a minor issue like bringing the wrong snacks, which justifies a firm response. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the host was too quick to act after one incident. But given the seriousness of the issue (a gun in the house), it's reasonable to address it immediately. The host is not in the wrong for setting boundaries in their own home. So the answer should be B.\n"
