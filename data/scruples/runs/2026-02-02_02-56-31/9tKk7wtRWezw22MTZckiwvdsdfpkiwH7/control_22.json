We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the context: The group meets at the author's house, and one member, Jim, carries a concealed gun. The author told Jim beforehand that guns aren't allowed in their house, so Jim should leave his in the truck. But during the first meeting, Jim still had the gun with him when the author wasn't around. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he was going to have a gun, leading Jim to leave the group.\n\nThe author's side is that it's their house and they set the rules. They put the rule in place before the meeting and gave Jim a chance. Jim didn't follow through, so they enforced the consequence. The reactions from others are mixed. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh.\n\nNow, considering the law: In many places, being in someone's home doesn't automatically prohibit carrying a concealed weapon, especially if the person has a permit. However, the author could have a private policy prohibiting guns in their home. But depending on state laws, a landlord or homeowner might not have the authority to require someone to leave their gun in the car if they have a valid concealed carry permit. Some states have \"castle doctrine\" laws that protect concealed carry in private homes, but the specifics would matter here.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, the author is within their rights to set boundaries for their home. They communicated the rule beforehand. Jim didn't comply, so the author acted on their policy. However, if the law allows him to carry there, even with the host's wishes, the author might not have legal grounds to kick him out, but socially, they can enforce their own rules. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, it's a gray area depending on local laws. Socially, the author did enforce their personal policy. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions were within their rights. If the law allows concealed carry in private homes, then the author might not have legal authority to prohibit it, but they can set social boundaries. However, the user's question seems to be more about moral or social wrongness rather than legal. \n\nIn the story, the author tried to set the rule before, and Jim didn't follow it. The author then banned him. Since it's their house and they can set their own rules, even if others think it's harsh. So the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
