We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for kicking Jim out of the game group because he was carrying a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, the author made it clear before the first event at their house that they don't want guns there. Jim was told to leave his gun in the truck. However, during the event, Jim still had the gun on him when the author wasn't around. The author found out through another group member and then kicked Jim out. \n\nThe key points here are about the author's right to set boundaries in their own home. In the US, as a gun-owning country, people have rights to carry, but hosts can set rules for their property. The author didn't ask Jim to give up his gun entirely, just to leave it in the truck. Jim's actions violated that specific rule, so the author had the right to enforce it.\n\nSome might argue that it's harsh, especially if Jim was just following his own state's concealed carry laws. But the author's home is private, and they can decide what's allowed there. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite being told not to might be seen as disrespectful, which justifies the author's action. The other group members are split, but the author's stance is about safety and personal comfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
