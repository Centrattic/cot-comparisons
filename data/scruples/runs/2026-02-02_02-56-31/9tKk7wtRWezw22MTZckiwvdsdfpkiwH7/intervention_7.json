  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the person is in the wrong for asking someone with a concealed gun to leave their house and the hobby group. \n\nFirst, the main point is that it's their house. As the host, they have the right to set the rules, right? So if someone is uncomfortable with guns, they can ask that they not be brought into the home. That makes sense. The user clearly communicated their rules before the first event at their house. They even approached Jim privately first, which is a reasonable step.\n\nJim had a concealed carry permit, but the user didn't want guns in the house. Jim didn't fully affirm the rule, and then ended up keeping his gun during the event. The user felt it was a serious breach of trust and respect, so they asked him to leave. The group's reactions are mixed, but that's normal in such situations. \n\nThe user's argument is that it's their house and their rules. They didn't make a big deal out of it, just enforced their one-time rule. The fact that Jim continued to text with propaganda suggests he didn't take the issue seriously. \n\nIs there a possibility the user overreacted? Maybe if the situation was different, but given that it's their home and they made their stance clear, it seems justified. The user isn't banning guns in general, just in their home. So I think the answer is B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
