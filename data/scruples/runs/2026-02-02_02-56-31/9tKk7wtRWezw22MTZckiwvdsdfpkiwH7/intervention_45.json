  "prompt": "Am I in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for kicking a guy out of my hobby group because of his concealed gun?\nI am in a little board game group that has been meeting regularly for the past six months. We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nAm I in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (I am in the wrong) and B for No (I am not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if they were in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. So, the situation is a board game group that meets at their house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and was carrying a gun during their game night. The user told Jim beforehand not to bring the gun into the house, but later found out Jim was still carrying it. The user then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, and Jim left. Now, the user is getting mixed reactions from the group and wants to know if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the user's perspective. They made it clear that their house is off-limits for guns. It's their home, so they have the right to set rules. If Jim didn't agree with that, maybe he shouldn't attend. The user stood by their rule, which they had communicated in advance. The user's main point is about safety and personal comfort, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, Jim had a concealed carry permit, which might mean he's legally allowed to carry in public places. But the user's house is private property, so even if it's legal to carry elsewhere, the user can set rules there. Jim might not have realized that. The user gave a warning first, which is fair. Then, when Jim still had the gun on him, the user followed through on their rule. That seems reasonable.\n\nThe reactions of the group are split. Some think it's fair, others think it's harsh. But the user's stance is about safety and trust. If Jim can't respect the user's rules, then the user is justified in removing him. Also, the user tried to handle it privately and first, not making a big deal out of it. The back and forth texts from Jim might be him overreacting, but that's his own behavior.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal angle here. In the U.S., a gun owner can be asked not to bring a gun into someone's private residence, and they have to comply if they want to be allowed in. So the user isn't violating any laws, just enforcing their own rules. The user is not in the wrong for protecting their home environment.\n\nSo the answer would be B, No, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
