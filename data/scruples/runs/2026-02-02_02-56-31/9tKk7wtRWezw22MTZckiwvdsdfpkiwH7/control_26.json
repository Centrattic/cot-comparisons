We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because of a concealed gun. The answer should be either A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is hosting a board game group at their house. One member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit and mentions he's always armed. The author told Jim privately that no guns are allowed in the house. Jim was supposed to leave his gun in the truck. However, during the first game night at the author's house, Jim had the gun on him when the author wasn't around. The author then told Jim he couldn't come back if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit. The group's reactions are mixed. The author's stance is that it's their house, so their rules apply.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, in the U.S., if someone has a concealed carry permit, they can legally carry a gun in their vehicle. But the author's house is private property, and the owner can set rules about guns there. So the author has the right to prohibit guns in their home, even if someone has a permit. However, the issue is whether the author overstepped by not allowing Jim to attend the meetings if he's carrying a gun. The author's main argument is about safety and personal boundaries. \n\nThe user might be considering if the author was too strict. However, the author made their rules clear beforehand. Jim didn't follow the rule, so the author enforced it. Even if Jim had a permit, the author's right to their own property is a key point here. Also, the fact that Jim continued to carry the gun despite being told not to might be a problem. The author's action could be seen as enforcing their own space, which is reasonable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
