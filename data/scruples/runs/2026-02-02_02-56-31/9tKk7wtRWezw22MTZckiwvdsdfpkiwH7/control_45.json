We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. The situation is that the author hosts game nights at their house, and one member, Jim, has a concealed carry permit. The author told Jim upfront that no guns in the house, but after the first event, another member told the author that Jim was still carrying his gun when they were in the kitchen. The author then told Jim he couldn't come if he had a gun, leading Jim to quit. The group is split on whether this was right.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries and safety. The author made it clear that guns aren't allowed in their home. Jim, despite being told, still had his gun on him, which the author found disrespectful and a breach of their rule. The author's stance is that it's their house and they set the rules. \n\nNow, legally, in many places, concealed carry is allowed, and unless the author has a specific policy against guns in their home (which they did communicate), Jim might have been within his rights. But the author is anti-gun and made the rule clear. The problem arises when Jim didn't comply with that rule. The author then took action to enforce their own space, which is their right. \n\nThe other group members' reactions are mixed, but the author's decision is based on their personal comfort and safety. Even if someone else thinks it's a bit strict, the author has the right to set boundaries in their own home. The fact that Jim continued to carry despite being asked is a violation, so the author isn't wrong for enforcing their rules. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
