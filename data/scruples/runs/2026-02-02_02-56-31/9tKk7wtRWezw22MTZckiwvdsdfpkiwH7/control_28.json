We used to have our game nights at a local hobby shop, but since we've gotten closer and the shop is in not the best part of town, have recently decided to start doing it at my house instead.\n\nThere's five of us total and one guy, \"Jim\" has a concealed carry permit and carries a gun with him. I know this because he's mentioned that he's always armed. I am very anti-gun but it had never come up before. Before our first game night at my place I told Jim privately that I don't want any guns in my house and that he would have to leave his in his truck if he brang it. He gave kind of an acknowledging but not exactly affirming response.\n\nThen after our first game session at my house, one of the other group members told me on her way out that Jim had told her he still had his gun with him while I was in the kitchen out of earshot. I texted Jim and told me he had been extremely disrespectful and that this wasn't a game, and he could not come to my house again if he was going to have a gun on him. His response was \"Fine, guess I won't be coming then,\" and he effectively quit the group.\n\nThe reaction with the rest of the group is split. One person doesn't care whether Jim participates or not, one person says it was \"harsh but fair\" and that Jim wasn't really kicked out per se, and one person thinks I am being a shrew and shouldn't have been so uptight about the gun after just one session, since he's never had to leave it behind before.\n\nMy point of view is that it's my house and my rules, and I don't think it's an unreasonable rule to not want a gun in my home. I put my foot down the first time it happened because it was a serious matter and not like he brought the wrong snacks or something. Jim keeps texting me going back and forth between saying \"lose my number\" and sending me links to propaganda supporting his viewpoint.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for kicking someone out of their hobby group because he had a concealed gun. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author owns their house and set clear boundaries about not wanting guns there. Jim has a concealed carry permit, which is legal, but the author made it clear that weapons aren't allowed in their home. Jim agreed to leave the gun in his truck initially, but later brought it inside, which the author found out through another group member. The author then asked Jim to leave the group if he was going to bring the gun. Jim quit, and there's mixed reactions from the others.\n\nSo, the key points here are about property rights and personal safety. The author has the right to set rules for their own home. Even though Jim is legally allowed to carry a gun, the author can enforce their own policies on their property. The author gave a warning first, which is reasonable. The other group members have different opinions, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The situation is about personal comfort and safety, which are valid concerns.\n\nIs there any reason to think the author overstepped? Maybe if they violated any laws, but the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially. Since the author communicated their stance and followed through, it seems justified. Also, Jim was aware of the rules and chose to ignore them, leading to the author's decision. The author isn't being unreasonable by enforcing their own boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
